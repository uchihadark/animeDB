Most anime series can be neatly categorized into some kind of cliche-ridden group or another: magical girls mecha sports slice of life ecchi.  Magical girl  series for example will always have prepubescent girls with colorful wands long transformation sequences and brains the size of a Chinese dumpling. That my dear kiddies is  cliche . It causes cancer.,18,9,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This one is actually good compared to the specials. It is a small field trip to the hotsprings. It is quite funny and there is an alternate romance idea and scene between two characters that may come as a surprise. Don't get your hopes up for seeing much though during this hotspring trip no parts are shown. It  includes most of the characters we know well so definitely worth a watch. ,21,12,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Inspired by an old videogame this 50 minutes anime talks about a heroic party who explores a dungeon filled with monsters in order to find an evil wizard and kill him. It's an old anime but well animated and well drawn. Violence abounds with blood deaths losing limbs. This OAV is so simple in its plot and so short that I don't have anything else to say. Those who likes RPGs and fantasy should watch it,27,18,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Haibane Renmei is a beautiful anime and I really do recommend you watch it. Respect to most anime it deals with completely different themes. Salvation and redemption self-discovery and spirituality. You get plunged in a world that's mysterious and dense with symbolism. And it's clear that the Haibane Renmei world has indeed been thought out in detail by its authors there's a sense of purpose and meaning behind everything it's inherently consistent. Even though there are things that are not explained you never really understand exactly what haibane are and what's beyond the walls and what happens to the haibane who leave for their first flight and how they ended up there in the first place and so on and so on... but somehow it doesn't matter. The story isn't about the world behind the anime it's about Rakka and Reki. While I was watching it I was forcefully reminded of a book written by Murakami Haruki Hard-boiled wonderland and the end of the earth; they have in common the city behind the walls the alternate world the mystical atmosphere ...,33,24,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,43,25,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story of Haibane Renmei was created by Yoshitoshi ABe as an original manga which was never completed but ended up becoming this anime in 2002. I know that ABe has also worked on Lain and Texhnolyze so I gotta say I'm really impressed with everything that he's done. This series in particular is my favorite amongst the aforementioned works though and I'll never forget the first time I watched through it.,44,26,2019-04-13 21:35:39
While I will try to remain unbiased as possible there will still be a large element of bias present in this review since this anime is one of my top favorites.,45,27,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Haibane Renmei was an anime that I thought was going to be more than what it was.  I was honestly a little disappointed.  If you're reading this it's a good thing because now you won't expect too much out of it.  I'm not saying it was bad.  I'm just saying that I was disappointed.,47,29,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'll start off by saying that if you don't like slow paced anime you won't like Saiyuki.  That said it's one of the most brilliantly written pieces of work.  Even the filler episodes are interesting and worth watching at least once.,55,37,2019-04-13 21:35:39

What made me so hooked on this anime wasn't the actual animation but the characters themselves. They each have their own detailed back story and are really fun to watch. Saiyuki has a huge amount of filler episodes and the only thing that keeps me from being bored to death are the characters.,61,43,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Yes yes Yes this is jouney to the west my friend and I wanna make sweet love to it that’s right see Sanzo Goku Gojo and Haikki in this funny brutal cliff jumping version of the cult classic. A Sanzo priest is venturing west in this story to discover the origins of a mist which has caused all demons that onced lived harmoniously with human to go insane. with him is the god born from stone (Goku) and the two half demons (Son Gojo - mother was a human father a demon) and Cho Hakkai (Killed over 1000 demons in a rampage after the loss of his beloved and became a demon himself). together they battle hords and uncover the story of the gods and there origins/ I love this beautiful work of art for both its humour and plot. watch it I urge you,62,44,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a really really great anime. It’s just so interesting and fresh. It’s actually made itself so distinct and unique that I can’t think of any other animes that I have seen that I can recommend this anime for. Believe me I’ve made a lot of recommendations and I try to make recommendations for all of the anime I’ve seen and liked. But I just can’t think of an anime I can recommend for people who like Chihayafuru never mind the second season. This is not a bad thing; in fact this might actually be a good thing. It just makes this anime all the more special because it just feels so new and original and it’s just honestly so great to watch.,66,48,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,67,49,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Clearly this is a half finished anime it has to be because it looks half finished but from all the reviews that's clearly not the case. I never thought that this would be the end of my long search for a good anime because this was truly attrocious. I just don't understand why I bothered but I guess I'll have to keep looking.,68,50,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The point of an anime is to offer a completely different view on the cultures but how this ever became something is beyond even me.Now granted I have never seen the original anime but if this is how it played then I want no part of it. Goodbye Rozen Maiden I won't be writing back. ,69,51,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My review may not be quite as critical as someone who read the manga as I have not yet.  But then judging it as a show is also a worthwhile thing.  It works to compare to manga if it somehow fouls it up bad enough is a poor transition and/or most importantly fails to measure up adequately to the strengths that made the manga worth reading or for that matter any adaption from some literary source to a tv show or movie.  That being said right from the start the series struggles to get off the ground.  It takes way too many liberties as if the viewer had already watched a season or two that was actually connected to season 3 and that is where it really messes things up.  Perhaps because there were already 2 previous seasons this season tries to skip ahead and imply maybe to some degree that it is in fact some sort of continuation of the earlier series though quirky as it maybe with a few events somehow altered.  Obviously few viewers will be fooled by this half hearted sloppy attempt.  First of all things move way too fast.  The entire first season is in a sense compressed into 1 or 1 and a half episodes in short order summary form.  That however is and feels rushed.  The audience is thrown headfirst into the middle of the story without any sort of set up to prepare them.  That is a bit like throwing passengers off a commercial airplane with no parachutes and thus no preparation no emergency to pre-empt the need and no parachute training to ensure they would do it right.  ,71,52,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Certainly a very different show from the previous ones. No guarantee you will like this just because you liked them. Rozen Maiden Z (Hah) tracks closer to the manga than the previous shows from what I understand. I never read the manga so I'm evaluating the show purely on its own merits. I enjoyed it as much if not more than the previous adaptation. Bottom line I give it a solid four stars. ,72,53,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is quite possibly one of the most cruelest adaptations of an anime to date. The Rozen Maiden series was great the story was amazing and the characters very relatable. But this fell short of that in so many ways the stories main focus was on a much different and quite frankly a less relatable older Jun whose main goal in life was whining. The music and general pitch of the series was at an alltime low it made me want to turn down the volume just as opposed to listen to it any further and the animation was just a disaster none of the dolls had noses and Suigintous dress was so black it was like staring into a black void on the sceen. This might be great for everyone else but to me is fell short of all expectations.,73,54,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Normally I steer clear of writing reviews due in part to saving the feelings of others but unfortunately this anime has given me reason for pause. Quite possibly the most ill conceived story in anime history. It's a shame and quite the outrage to the original series which mind you had it's faults. However it was nothing compared to this disaster. There was nothing original if you count the god awful artwork and let's talk about the maturity level of this anime shall we? Aside from the slightly creepy nature of Kiraksuishou and the opening of the episode which showed a barely clothed Hina being stripped as the credit rolls. That alone nearly drove me away from this anime thinking it had catered to the Loli crowd.,74,55,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was a really cute movie. I'd never watched or read any Doraemon before but I saw this under the list of movies during a flight to Japan and thought I'd give it a go and I was pleasantly surprised.,75,56,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I thought It’d be a failure. ‘Russian anime oh Lord and It’s about the War!’ – that’s what I thought. The Second World War (aka The Great Patriotic War for Russians) is the main theme for lots and lots of movies cartoons TV-series books.. And now they created an anime.,80,60,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was a bit disappointed after watching First Squad. It's set during WWII and the main protagonist is a Russian girl named Nadya who has the power of seeing the future. This seems like it could lead to something interesting. Nope! First Squad is just under an hour but despite it being relatively short it is still fairly bland and dull.,81,61,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This review has been long awaiting post.  I originally did this review after the film came out in English.  However I've done some editing based on new opinions and watching it many more times.  I believe it's a must to watch a Studio Ghibli film at least twice before reviewing it; you'll get a much better opinion that way (especially if you grew up on them).,123,103,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Howl's Moving Castle is a great way to get hooked on anime i mean the story anybody would love it especially girls who love rommance movie. Infact it was my first and i've been hooked ever since i watch it so i recommend you watch Howl's Moving Castle even if your not sure you'll like it but trust me when i say this you'll never want to stop watch this movie or the other Animes.,130,110,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Howl's Moving Castle is a GREAT movie about a young orphan named Sophie she works at a hat shop in which she encounters a wizard named Howl. As they each show each other their friendship Sophie comes across Lettie as Cesari's and walks back into the hat shop and gets hit by the witch of the waste. When she turns old she decides to run away from home and come upon a scarecrow named  Turnip Head . In which he shows her Howl's castle. When she goes inside it she meets a talking fire and a little boy who's practicing his magic in his costume. And the story goes on...,131,111,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime! I wanted to cry so badly! It's so sweet and funny! I just knew I would love it! My mom watched half of it with me but she got too tired. We couldn't stop laughing! Oh! The prince! It must be horrible for your true love not to love you in return! It so sad and sweet and funny. I mean I'm going totally fan-girl here!,134,114,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is one of my favourite animes based on a book by britsh author Diana Wynne Jones the movie by studio ghibli is one of there best the art work music and excellently chosen story line makes it a great movie. Id recommend it to any anime fan especially if you are yet to see it because its an instant anime classic as are most studio ghibli movies there like japanese disney make fantastic family movies.,135,115,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Just a simple disclaimer before I begin: I understand there is a book tied to this movie. Unfortunately I haven't read it so this review is from that perspective but rest assured I'll be reading the book fairly quickly.,136,116,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Loved the music! A perfect tale for happiness! Watched it six times! All characters are likeable in their own way. And funny too. Could tone down the romance (it's on the verge of cheesy in some parts) and war plot (don't know what it is all about... not mentionned in the novel...). But nevertheless I highly recommend it. Good for an introduction to anime! ,137,117,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I loved it. Not as a story but the drawing the creativity the world this movie took us to is 10/10. As expected from Ghibli's works. ,138,118,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Final Fantasy: Unlimited Synopsis Twelve years ago a mysterious pillar of darkness erupted off the coast of Japan. Giant dragon-like beasts emerged from the darkness first wiping out the naval force investigating the disturbance then each other in a spectacular magical battle caught on videotape by a Japanese couple on the mainland. In the present day their twin children live in a largely deserted metropolis where the subway has only one destination:  The Inner World . Following in their parents' footsteps they encounter strange creatures powerful magic-users and of course chocobos. But where have their parents gone ... and what are the motivations behind the joining of the worlds? Review In the last decade Final Fantasy has established itself as the marquee title in the role-playing genre and nearly everyone who has touched a video game system has played at least one incarnation of this game. However a good game series doesn't necessarily translate into instant success in other fields as FF: Legend of the Crystals proved to our eternal dismay. Of course this was followed up by the 3D computer-generated film FF: The Spirits Within whose animation has been praised by many but whose plot hasn't quite proved as worthy of acclaim. So where does FF: Unlimited fit into all this? Well as the franchise's first full-length television series it's not a bad start. The FMV mastery of the Final Fantasy games has translated quite well into the 3D CG animation field and this is in effect from the first minute of this show. Spell and mechanical effects (much of which seem the same when it all comes down to it) are beautifully rendered and wondrous to behold. Unfortunately the traditional 2D cel animation of the characters is nowhere as impressive - while competent it really reflects on this title's intentions as more of a children's show than a show for older FF fans. The style is firmly entrenched in Saturday morning but at least it's better than FF Legend of the Crystals. More rabid FF fans may have to resist the urge to mail-bomb the animators especially when the animation goes from adequate to really bad in certain spots. While the premise is interesting it's evident from the beginning that this is Final Fantasy for the Digimon crowd - rather than dwelling on the mystery of magic and action involving powerful beasts the audience gets to watch the children get into various chocobo shenanigans usually involving the yanking of Ai's pigtails. Adult characters seem to be either glorified babysitters ciphers or weird creepy villains. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing but fans of the more recent FF titles will probably be disappointed. And the action sequences could've used a lot more polish. I really don't think any reasonable creature would just sit there while so-and-so takes fifteen minutes to summon Phoenix or Typhoon ... would you? Not to mention the questionable choice of opponents - after you've shown the audience super-cool dragons and magical trains you can't tease them with the Stay-Puff Mushroom Man. Come on already! At least the spell effects look cool. Still FF: Unlimited has an interesting story peppered with amusing in-jokes like having the famous victory played after the end of a battle and numerous references to the earlier FF games. The characters are likable and cute and the music gets a passing grade. Bonus points for the adorable (if obviously no-budget) end sequence especially if you're a chocobo fan. While I reserve the right to raise my opinion of this show if and when the plot starts kicking in our first look at this title gives us the feeling that perhaps the creators and animators weren't as Unlimited as they thought. Simplistic 2D animation and a kiddified plot may drive off newer FF fans who are more used to Tidus and Yuna (or even Zidane and Garnet) than Palom and Porom. But as a synthesis of classic Final Fantasy and modern monster-show visuals it's worth a further look.,141,120,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sugar Spice and all things nice these were the ingredients chosen to create the Magun the perfect little weapon…well no but I must say ultima weapon is there though. Yes it shows 2 men fighting out across a fantasy world to create peace and chaos whos bad whos good its typical FF and we love it. ,144,123,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is nothing new to fans of the Evangelion TV series. While there are instances in which footage from the extra scenes released in Japan was included in Death & Rebirth the scenes were minimal but some of those scenes did lead into a bit more detail into the Evangelion saga. The first part (Death) contained mostly rehashed scenes from the TV series some of which were altered slightly. In one instance the tint of the screen and angle of the footage was altered. It is a shame though. You would think that a movie such as this would have a better budget to allow for some new animation. Well there are some new music clips but many of these weren't even composed by anyone on the Evangelion staff. The classical pieces played throughout the first part are works of Bach and other composers. But after Death we finally recognize the true motive of GAINAX. Death turns out to be nothing more than a time consumer to allow for the showing of Rebirth in theaters in Japan. Rebirth is more of an advertisement than it is a movie in itself. Rebirth shows approximately the first half hour of the Evangelion movie and what a half hour it is. Finally SEELE has turned its back on Ikari Gendou for not adhering to their plans. SEELE sends in commandos to kill all who work in NERV headquarters (and in a violent manner at that). SEELE has also unleashed the rest of the Eva series to fight Asuka. And that's where it ends. While I liked the second part of the movie the obvious objective of the movie really turned me off and prevented me from truly enjoying this anime. This DVD is a must-buy only for the hardened Evangelion fan or just a huge collector of anime DVDs.,146,125,2019-04-13 21:35:39

every now and then i decide to watch an anime that looks... silly... or child oriented....,153,132,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As someone who enjoys Ragnarok Online most than any MMORPG the animation was a disappointment. The characters were stereotypical and the action uninteresting. Nothing of value from the immersive and special atmosphere of the in-universe transpired in the anime. Watch it if you're a fan of the game (just so you can enjoy more your stay in the game) otherwise take it as it is: a bland marketing device of Gravity to outreach to more potential customers.,154,133,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Players of Ragnarok Online you may be able to add 2 or 3 to the rating I have given just because you'll actually have some understanding of what's going on and you'll find some of the references to the actual game humorous. I myself am a former RO-player so I actually managed to get some enjoyment out of this series. To the rest of you all who know nothing about the game I strongly advise you to find another series to look at. There are two main reasons for this.,155,134,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'm writing this at episode 35 of the second season. If you've watched many sports anime you won't be surprised by anything plotwise. It feels as though the story is stretched in an attempt to add depth but I'd say that they've failed to do so. The characters still feel one dimensional at this point and the little growth they've shown has taken far too long.,156,135,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 The plot,157,136,2019-04-13 21:35:39
ahhhh fairy tail really pulled through. i loved this anime first season but then after the SS class challenge when they were gone for 7 years the anime really went down. it was pretty boring but they picked it back up again with the grand prix for best guild in magnolia. right now its on the tartaros arc and it is AMAZING.after watching and picking up on each characters stories and basically growing with them this arc moves you. i love the music fairy tail displays its very medievel themed with a mix of action. this anime feels like the real deal. any other anime i watch can't fill the empty space that yearns for the next episode in fairy tail,158,137,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is the best way i can spend my Sunday. So many characters anybody can relate to But lets be honest we all watch for the Dragon Slayers!!!!!!,159,138,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Like the first part wasn't shitty enoughthey added the worst animation ever.Great job animators for ruining something that is already ruined.,160,139,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I think most people fail to realize is that Fairy Tail is all about the music sound in the moment. The story changes between mediocre to great. If just they added as much love into the fights as they do the sound and music in the fights it would probably become to awesome for anyone to review. Characters don't develop much but they are all original in their own right and they all make an impression giving the story the depth that it desperatly needs.,161,140,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Origanly I was reluctant to watch Fairy Tail but my friend made me and it was amazing. I love the characters and the sory and how they make the characters stories truly makes me cry when they almost die. I highly recomend this anime even if you don't like it at first glance. It had me at the first episode! The music is very nice and I can listen to them all on relpay. Just when you think you know who your favorite character is they give you a tearful story of backround then they're your new favorite. Again this is my #1 anime and you need to at least give it a shot.,162,141,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Oh God. Please kill me with this one. Having to put a short skit of comedic jokes in all episode is just pathetic and annoying. I enjoyed watching the First 178 Episodes of this anime because its really great and its not forced compare to this resurrection of Fairy Tail. Its getting worst.,163,142,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is part of a series and a series I like. This is worthy. It's had ups (the original) and downs (the original sequel) but overall it is a good series of shows. The meat of the series is supernatural occurences with a side of high school drama and fan service. This one is not much different but it is definitely one of the better ones... actually the best if you do not consider the original which was genius.,168,147,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"Though it has been some time since watching Escaflowne I remember going into it expecting something decent and being dissapointed. However I must say that once the initial sadness of it being a worthwhile anime wore off I quickly began enjoying the anime as a comedy laughing at the cliche riddled storyline hilariously bad characters(not all of them persay) and the constant weird trips that come on suddenly throughout the series. ",174,152,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Big massive sword wielding mecha armorsuits - How can this be so dull?,177,155,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To put it quite simply Escaflowne is about a girl named Hitomi who leads a somewhat normal live of Earth but then one day she gets transported to another world that is falling under the shadow of an evil empire and she now discovers that she has the ability to see the future of what will happen in that world.  So it is up to her to as to whether she will use her abilities to help Vaan the young king who just happens to have brought Hitomi to this other world.  What follows is a story of mecha battles fantasy romance and destiny told in such a manner that few series can ever actually achieve and those that do tend to take at the very least twice as long as Escaflowne.  Remembering that this series came out sometime in the 90's it does look a bit aged by today's standards though in all honesty I'm not quite sure that the aged look takes anything away from the series.  Actually in all honesty I actually have a harder time imagining the series with a whole bunch of fancy CGI and whatnot.  I don't the older look of the animation just kind of fits the series.  If that makes any sense.  Anyways moving onto the audio which quite really amazingly done.  I feel in love with the opening the first time I ever heard it and the rest of the soundtrack is about as nice as they come.  Though that being said the ending is probably the only real problem in the sound department.  Overall Escaflowne is one those series that gets it right where it actually counts which is the plot and storytelling.  For anyone who needs a fantasy romance series they'll be hard pressed to find one that does those things as good as Escaflowne does.,178,156,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In one dimension she is a regular school girl in the other she battles with the protagonst to save the planet and avenge a wrongdoing…no this isnt Inuyasha its Vaan a prince who has lost his kingdom and fights to save the world but what mystery's does he and the battle armor escaflowne have. a good upbeat series aimed at anime fans that like a less noir style serious show,179,157,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"I encountered the fantasy genre fairly late considering how often I'd steeped myself in fiction during my young life. Escaflowne appeared as the first fantasy anime to flash onto my television.  It forged a powerful introduction: quick-moving action blatant tension and giant mechs I'd never seen on typical Saturday-Morning cartoons. Two emotive impressions I recieved from my early encounter are anticiption and disappointment: the prior from conclusion of one episode and the latter from the show's cancellation. With these two feelings I returned to Escaflowne years later. ",183,161,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Vision of Escaflowne has something of a name for itself in anime history for being an an attempt to appeal to both shonen and shoujo demographics at the same time. Featuring mechas swordfights explosions stuff burning etc. alongside bishonen male protagonists in a love triangle with the regular everyday girl from another world seems to be a lot of its selling point and as a result it's often fondly remembered as a true anime classic of the 90s.,186,164,2019-04-13 21:35:39

To be quite honest despite it only being a one-episode OVA I'm surprised I managed to get through it. My numbers may seem high based on that sentence but I am trying to be fair and consider each aspect individually... It's going to be hard. This was really a waste of time to be honest but I'll try to be fair and unbiased in my review.,189,167,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It's a really peaceful story of a boy with a loving heart. While the previous seaon had some episodes that were supposed to be funny and I hated them this Zoku season had no such annoying episodes. All of them are lovely ones.,190,168,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a good anime because it has a very good story line to it. I like how the epsiodes flow together even though almost every episode is about a diffierent problem for Natsume. I like the animaion of the characters because some of them have really good detail. I also like the animation of the scenary. I like most of the songs in this anime. I also like the sound of some of the characters voices. The characters in this anime are very good and they all get along together really nicely. I just wish that Natsume was more open though. So over all this is a good anime and it continues the series very well.,193,171,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Last summer I had the chance to watch Natsume Yuujinchou Zoku Natsume Yuujinchous prequel and my verdict was that it was a really charming series with heart and love into it. I also said that i was hooked enough to take a look into it's sequels and that I did.,194,172,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou (AKA Natsume’s Book of Friends 2) is the second season of 13 episode supernatural drama anime which is episodic and has aspects of slice of life. The original series was very relaxing to watch and this remains the same it’s peaceful (almost if it weren’t for youkai attacks) but the plot is shallow while retaining the fun lovable character we’ve had before. But how long can an episodic slice-of-life last before it gets stale and proper narrative is needed?,195,173,2019-04-13 21:35:39

When I first saw the image for this anime I thought  Hey it looks pretty cool. Kind of cheesy-looking but still kind of cool.  Read the bio got a little more excited. However all signs turned from cool to  meh  within the first episode. ,197,175,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Rainy Cocoa isn't something to get obsessed over. It's not something where you count down the days and hours 'til the next installment. It's not unlike a real cafe -- you can drop in for a short time semi-regularly if you choose. You can develop a familiarity with the comings and goings of the regulars there even if you forget their names or what they did last week. You aren't really meant to extend your visit too long. It's just a nice and comfortable place to pause before going on with the rest of your day.,199,177,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I know a lot of people said they didn't like this Anime but I really enjoyed it. It is a BL anime (Boy love anime) so it is a lot more focused on the characters and the relationships than the story line. Therefore you shouldn't go into this anime expecting a lot of cool fighting or an extremely complex story arc. ,209,187,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I was really hoping this would all tie together in some kind of awesome non-obvious but clearly plausible and tied-together way like  12 Monkeys  or for a non-time-related example that's an anime with much better fight scenes more badassness characters with development that you feel something for and a plot that all comes together at the end  Hellsing .,220,198,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series had promise. With the many inexplicable things that go on and are later explained I thought it would be better than this. The idea for the story didn't seem like it was fully developed and could've used some work. Some of the characters seemed too corny or had been done before that it was hard to make it through the 12 episodes. They did great with the animation but I think they could've done a bit better. Overall it just seemed like a disappointment. Even the ending was pretty bad with the explanation for it all. I would only recommend this to people that have nothing else to watch.,221,199,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,222,200,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime I feel didn't constantly focus on story but was great with presenting it and I think the story is pretty unique but might be a hit or miss for some people. I like the animation for the way they drew the characters and tanks. Sound was decent I didn't hear much background noise except for the gun fire and occasional tank missles or explosion noises made by a character at the end of a episod. I really liked the characters in this but I would like a little bit backstory to them. One would be  Why are there children in the military? . Although this more of personal preference each character had a lot of personality to them so I found it enjoyable and I wish there was more than just 1 season of Military! Overall I liked this anime and recommend it for anyone who has time to spare and by that I mean at least 4 minutes to watch a episode although it is not everyone's cup of tea and might not be well-liked by those who want a large amount of story.,223,201,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Shorts are always the things I look forward to in the new season as they do much more in the 4 minutes given if they utilise it properly. For me Military was a great show and was one of the 3 shows i looked forward to during it airing.,225,202,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This review is a personal opinion and it should be treated as such.,227,204,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was rather excited for this show after the first season. but unfourtunatly this season has pacing issues and although had a nice little happy ending to it all. there are still a few questions that were left compeltly unanswered from the first season. I Still strongly recommend the first season of the shis show and to watch this season to see some closure but if it wasnt for the first season I would probably not recommend this show/season at all. Music was really good and animation wasnt bad either.,228,205,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Horrible and boring. I don't know how to talk about the plot it is a bunch of senseless ideas. Nobody should watch this anime except somebody who (like me) has a lot of spare time and nothing better to do.,230,207,2019-04-13 21:35:39
While the main story has pleasantly surprised me this has been more of a dissapointment. Yes it was just an OVA not a movie so it's not like I was expecting some kind of twisted plot but let's admit that they could make us see more than !!SPOILER!! Kotori's two large halves of chest stuffed in a naked apron. It's not like I was an avowed objector of ecchi but I don't enjoy it especially when there's more to be expected since it's a show about witches aliens dead-or-die battles and running away from mad scientists so why the heck did I have to look at Hatsuna's bottom half? If you asked me how do I imagine making a script for a special episode of a sci-fi anime after seeing this my answer would be not far from something like the line below:,231,208,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation - Heir to the Stars is the first of three movies that complie the Zeta Saga. This movie covers pretty much the first 15 episodes of the tv series more or less. There are changes to the story that's why it's a new translation. But these changes are not drastic at least not in this first movie. The story covers the Gryps Wars. We are introduced to Kamille Bidan and several other characters. We are also reintroduced to old faces from the One Year War.  The original tv series was released in 1985 and with this movie they inserted about 20 minutes of new animation. So there is a mesh of old and new animation. It's very obvious when something new is on the screen but it flows well. It doesn't take anything aways from the story. The new animation is great. Even though the original animation is dated I personally still like it it holds well. Zeta Gundam is known for it's soundtrack. The introduction is different and performed by GACKT. I personally preferred the original intro music as retro as it would have sounded today. Lots of the soundtrack was intact in this movie.The tv series was exceptional regarded as the best Gundam series by many. So compressing it into 3 movies could not have beeb an easy feat.,234,211,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This isn't the worst Naruto story out there but there are many other filler episodes that are much better. I feel like the biggest problem with this special was just that it took so long. During the first half the pacing wasn't too bad but once it got to the hostage situation...

This was a really good anime. It had a good plot and setting. It doesn't rank very high but to me it's not such a bad anime. The plot could have been done a bit better. There's not much to say to this anime becase it doesn't have that many flaws but it deosnt have that many good things to say either. Even though it is still a good anime to watch. If your a really young kid by the age of 10-12 you might really like this show but if your a guy/girl with age 14+ I recommend you go watch another anime because the story really isn't for older viewers.,247,224,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well this anime is one of those that is now in the pile of failed animes.

Normally when someone creates an anime or manga based on a video game it loses what was special about that game. Most of the time even though I don’t play many games myself I don’t tend to like these shows because it always feels like I’m out of the loop of some element to the story. Strangely taking this show out of context made the show much better and I actually liked it.,263,240,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: Most of the anime isn't connected it works as stand alone episodes a sort of monster-of-the-week feel to it. It's barely related to the video game series mostly only the characters and the setting,264,241,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The DMC anime series I really did enjoy. I felt it was one of those shows that wasn't meant to have a certain end game. You know just one that was just them going on a lot of missions. What I think made it kind of whack was Patty's involvement. Patty is just some random little girl that tags with Dante.  I think she was kind of pointless in the series. You know just a floating character. I would recommend people watching just to appreciate the art the missions that Dante goes on. I must warn you Patty will annoy you.,265,242,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Soooo borrrinnng. Flat characters no plot to speak of formulaic battle scenes repetitive sound track backgrounds look nice at least. Maybe more appealing to fans of the game. ,266,243,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Whether you like gaming or watching your gunna find this great. Dante is another one of those simply perfect characters I was talking about. He is funny unstoppable and smart. As the son of Earth's saviour he is just the best and a must watch short series,269,246,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The badass Dante is back! The story of DMC is the same but Dante is now taking care of a little girl! Dante is still killing demons with his long gun. The girl who Dante looks after has inherited her parents money and is a must have for Demons. Dante saved Patty(the girl) and she is now becoming a burden. Dante and Patty are a good pair because Patty doesnt know a whole lot about Demons but Dante does. So with the scenes of them together his knowledge really makes it interesting.,279,256,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The STORY of Devil May Cry while not awful is concluded poorly.  This brings down it's entire grade as a whole.  The plot begins with a man named Dante who runs a demon-slaying business.  Although the series starts out rather fun and promising it soon degrades into something that's painful to continue watching.  Why was Dante able to defeat that last demon in hell so easily?  And why was he staked up like Jesus in one scene and then bad ass in the next?  So many questions left unanswered.,282,259,2019-04-13 21:35:39

SPOILER WARNING,294,271,2019-04-13 21:35:39
spoilers ahoy. I really think that the second season was not supposed to be produced- that they expected to finish it in 12 episodes and that was their ending.  I think that because in the first episode of the second season they undid everything they did in the finale of season 1.  They brought everyone back to life and then it became a soap opera- a girl in a coma now she loses her memories a girl in a wheelchair whose in love with the boy who's in love with her bed ridden sister and on and on and on.  There were a lot of moments in this season where I thought wow they did that just to get a reaction out of me it was unnecessary and now that my shock has worn off cheesy.  I was disappointed by that.  I also did not like that Slaine basically retired to a room and pointed and shouted out orders no more actual fighting for him.  All of that aside I still enjoyed it very much.  I loved the story arc with Slaine's corruption in his quest for power all for love.  It reminded me so much of Anakin in Star Wars.  You start watching and you think he's the hero and you're just enjoying watching this sweet kid but you're actually seeing how the famous Darth Vader came around and the origin of the saying  the road to hell is paved with good intentions.   That monsters are not creatures who just are born evil they're people like you like me like Slaine from season 1 who just wanted to protect the person they loved.  It was a tragic story.  I think they fell off the wagon a little in the end with Slaine.  I wasn't sure why he started acting like a robot all of a sudden- when Seylum told him this was not what she wanted I thought he would at least react a little or stop since everything he had done was for her happiness but he openly said to his assistant that he didn't care if they understood in time at all and showed no emotion.  I wanted to know what he was thinking in the last few episodes and that didn't really come except in a flash here and there- when he fought Inaho and in the cell.  The ending was incredibly touching in that room but I was unsatisfied that the war ended that way.  I really thought they would need to destroy aldnoah as a technology to equalize martians and humans and something would make the earthlings take in the martians to live together on earth.  I also have unanswered questions such as why did Slaine not gain the power of Aldnoah when Seylum resucitated him when they met but Inaho gained it when he resusitated her?       ,295,272,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The beggining started off a little slow for me and it wasn't quiet enjoyable but then again i'm gore and crazy action kind of girl. I like when we land right in the midddle of the story and we work our way from there but in this anime it wasn't really like that but it was quiet good for a first episode.  ,298,275,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To watch this anime someone has probably watched all the previous series and therefore already likes it to have gone that far. It pretty much resembles the rest of the series in style and storyline.,299,276,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"A este punto creo que cualquiera que vaya mirar Hanamonogatari es un fan de las serie en general y por lo tanto sabe que esta serie contiene centenares de líneas de dialogo y eso está bien la mayoría son atractivas bastante llevaderas y que ayudan a ir desarrollando la trama. A fuego lento pero con buen sabor. Lastimosamente este no es el caso de Hanamonogatari. La adaptación de la novela está a la altura lo que no está a la altura de las otras es su pobre historia. Hanamonogatari tiene más diálogos de los que necesita y más episodios de los que debería. Los primeros 3 episodios nos veremos bombardeados de un dialogo que si no es absurdo es muy pretencioso que alenta innecesariamente el desarrollo de su historia la cual dicho sea de paso no es muy interesante. Esto hace preguntarme: Con tanto misterio e incógnitas vistas en la temporada anterior ¿Por qué no se resolvió o se desveló algo más de información de estos en lugar de desperdiciar los 5 episodios en una historia bastante aburrida? Los diálogos insinúan más de lo que Kanbaru podría representar. ",300,277,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series is just so damn good it never leaves me dry. Requires having watched all Bakemonogatari before watching this pretty much and it takes the story forwards. It's just so cool to see the constant character development and the themes unfold. The writing is brilliant same for the animation and the distinct style. Sounds and especially music are insanely good. I can not praise this series enough go watch it!,301,278,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I watched this fresh off of watching Second Season which I thought was great all around. Whenever this happens I lower my standards for the sequel so I don't ruin it with high expectations. In this case I still didn't like it.,302,279,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I won't romanticize it; I watched this for the ecchi goodness.  Burnt out after a stretch of serious/emotional anime I needed something sugary for a change of pace.  You can't write much about this show without spoiling it so I will just say that the ecchi kept me going for the first few episodes but I would have finished this anime without it.  An intruiging premise and a good story line are peppered with attractive if two-dimensional characters and tons of tongue in cheek humor.  So good and all the more so because I wasn't expecting it.,305,282,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I watched this anime some time ago and dropped it disgusted after the first two episodes. I remember thinking it was a real waste of time. Then last week I happened to read some reviews and they all agreed on saying that it's just the first episodes that are crappy and that it's actually worth giving it a try. And so I did. And so it is. Don't get me wrong it's still a pretty average anime with loads of panty shots and fan service but the plot - when it starts to emerge - is quite interesting and the humor is a case of being so bad it's good - if you don't take yourself too seriously that is most of it is lewd sex jokes; but they did have me laughing.,306,283,2019-04-13 21:35:39

After watching an anime like this it is quite hard to give a honest unbiased review. I have to say I loved it. This anime is not a revolutionary  OMG SO GOOD WOW  anime. It is an anime quite similar to My Teenage Romantic Comedy Snafu if you have watched it. It's the type of anime that is heart warming at times and  ughh...  at others. I loved this anime because I could truly relate to its characters. They were really well made in my opinion with depth in each character. Realism also a major factor in this anime. No cliche in the harem :D Story is above par and quiet interesting. I think you will find that this anime is a good watch.,313,290,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,324,301,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I found that the story and characters were refreshing and new. However the thing that held the series back was the lack of any real progressing in the story other than that of Kodaka and his memories of his childhood friend. The anime has a really open-ended conclusion and that is of course due to the fact that the light novel series is still in progress but I felt that they could've done better with the anime adaption. I'm definitely going to read the light novels now. If they make a second season I'll gladly watch it but I hope that it will have a more stronger story development.,325,302,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kara no Kyoukai Movie 6: Boukyaku Rokuon is not that bad. The plot is actually rather good (though not exceptional) the animation and sound are solid the characters are rather interesting and it manages to be self contained. That being said it should have either been shortened to tighten up the details and keep a stronger focus on the plot or lengthened in order to give more depth to the characters.,326,303,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I just finished staying up till 2am to watch every episode.. Not my best decision but we'll skip that for now. This show will have you saying  NOOO DON'T HURT HER  one minute and then  ...That is sexual harassment.  the next! Fun right? Anyway this anime is about a girl who is the daughter of a dark lord who is taken by a dumb pervert to his world which is basically the normal human world but with magic. But in just about every episode they flash a girl's tits (Personally I can't stand anime characters with oversized boobs that aren't even realistic! It could just be jealousy though) and imply that he basically rapes her. But there are some guys who like that kind of thing (if you like that kind of thing I'm not judging but personally thats perv-ish) it can be quite adorable sometimes though and I really hope they come out with a sequal.,341,318,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero (Hagure Yuusha no Estetica) in this anime there really isn't a lot to go on: There is magic two different worlds a lot of ecchi plus borderline hentai I felt in this case and comedy all thrown into thirteen episodes with one being wasted on a beach episode which didn't really move along the plot at all.,344,321,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Corpse Princess 2 AKA Shikibane Hime - Kuro is a 12 episode ecchi supernatural action anime about monks monsters and undead corpse women. I had watched the first season a good while back and it wasn’t that bad but I didn’t like it’s reliance on this sequel it left an incomplete story. Within the first few episode of this I was very confused and annoyed by a few things would this change as I watched more of it? That said I watched season 1 a long time ago back when I had different tastes and tolerances. Before I even started writing these reviews. I’ll also do the usual spiel on my dislike for ecchi harem and pointless pervy fan-service so please take this into account while reading my review.,349,326,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Really this actually exists as an actual anime and not as a H because if it were a H the police would come batting your door down before the openning finishes. Its meant to be innocent but everything about this show is far from it and its just awkward to watch. A guy goes to a school reunion gets the piss taken out of him for being Neet and heard a rumour of a pool that sends you to another dimension at night. He soon find out after falling in and resurfacing to the sight of 5th grade girls from which he decides to try changing the future of. considering he actually hung around with cute girls this show feeds on the fact he did and puts them in ecchi situations. as a man in a child body he ends up having the  1-up  quite often and is generally commenting about it being hotr or raunchy.,365,342,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Shiki is a show about vampires creatures that has been in every media in recent years and anime is not an exception. So ¿what this show has to offer to became outstanding when it looks like nobody can tell nothing new?,367,344,2019-04-13 21:35:39

AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,370,347,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Shiki definitely displays the common themes found in horror genres. I must say being a fan of the genre urged me to watch this series. Fuyumi Ono is the creator of the show. She had also made the Anime/Manga Ghost Hunt (highly recommended) which is another reason for me to watch Shiki.,371,348,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is by far the best vampire series that I have seen in a long time.  As far as the horror genre I haven't seen a plot or character development as good as the attempt made by this series since GunGrave Deathnote or Monster. This was great. I am sure no one will ever see the ending coming as it was such a surprise. The animation was pretty gothic with a little lolicon pink hair green hair and fun in it too! There was a little comedy too. Overall this was a great series!,372,349,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hohoho! Secret Santa Review,375,352,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: This is anime is about a small country town gets invaded by a group of shiki/vampires and the struggles that everyone goes through.,376,353,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Vampires have been enjoying quite a renaissance in Western media lately mainly because of the advent of Twilight. In anime however tales of bloodsuckers have been pretty constant over the years but like the West there has been an increase in the number of stories involving the children of the night. The only problem is they all seem to romanticise vampires by giving them kind gentle personalities good looks a reluctance to drink human blood or some other hook to make the viewer believe that creatures who look on humans as food can be considered friendly.,378,355,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Shiki or Corpse Demon if you think it would be weird to say  Shiki  is a kind of underrated horror anime. It's not as spectacular as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni when it comes to horror but it's much better horror than the likes of Corpse Party or any recent American horror movie. This show doesn't abstractly hide a serial killer in a curtain it stays undetected and once the reveal is made no one is left on the edge of any seat. This is a very compelling mystery series that requires a full-watch to truly understand. If you believe that horror anime is just battle shounen with gore (i.e. Tokyo Ghoul Akame ga Kill!) and you want a taste of true horror anime Shiki is for you.,380,357,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Shiki is not for the faint of heart but those looking for a different perspective on the loyaly traditional vampires. Even though it's a horror anime it is also a dark drama that questions the audience about whether or not they could kill a corpse demon that needs large amounts of human blood in order to survive even if said demon is your former neighbour or family/friend who still has his memories intact. Each death is a tragedy and there really isn't a right or wrong answer to the growing conflict in the series. its comedy is very dark and demented and visually it is very atmospheric and sets the perfect tone it is trying to get (although the animation for the most part is nothing special). FUNimation gave it their all with this one and there is plenty of raw emotion behind the voices providing an enjoyable experience for people such as myself who prefer watching anime English-dubbed. The characters and story are two of Shiki's strongest points. My personal favourites are Dr Toshio Ozaki for his iron will and sharp-mind and Hasegawa the coffee shop owner for his sympathy and mercy towards his former neighbours/turned shiki  while my least favourites are Megumi Shimizu because of how bitchy and twisted she is and Tatsumi for his over-usage of blackmail and peer pressure.,381,358,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First let me begin by saying that this anime is almost if not exactly like 90% of all other vampire stories out there.,382,359,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Are you tired of fake as hell vampires? Do you want to stab Edward in the eye with your spoon? Are you exhausted with the countless shows that over power vampires giving them no weakness and over fantasizing them? Well look no further friend I have a show for you..

Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,384,361,2019-04-13 21:35:39
For me this show was a blast begin to end. It was perfect during its airtime making it one of  my perennial favorites. The story may be quite simple but the way it represents humanity is absolutely perfect and does make sense. It doesn't fear to go beyond morality making it sometimes hard to watch. The music is fantastic and constructs an magnificent atmosphere of anguish and fear. The cast is huge and really well constructed.So this is perfection for me.,385,362,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I absolutely loved this anime. It's not often that I come across a vampire anime in which I actually like the vampire characters as vampires and the human characters as humans but in 'Shiki' I actually did. I thought the mythology surrounding vampires was interesting especially with the relations to the story Seishin tells about Cain and Abel. In a lot of western vampire stories Cain and Abel-style stories are told but this was one of the first I actually liked. I thought Natsuno struck the balance between whiney and stoic well and I thought Toru's motivations as a vampire (or okiagari if you want to be technical) were well thought out. I absolutely loved the character of Megumi. Her character was much improved upon death; the malevolent and sadistic version was much more interesting.One thing I would possibly mark the story down on was the use of the child-vampire which has been done so many times it's old. However this was somewhat relieved by her relationship with Seishin which was precarious and fascinating enough to hold my interest. About half of the way through when you realise that Natsuno has been bitten (and not only bitten but rises from the grave) is where it really gets exciting because it isn't often that the hero dies. Another thing I would possibly mark the story down on was the ending. Although it was good and conclusive and tied up all the loose ends I would have preferred it if the shiki had won and the village fell to the vampires but that's probably because I'm morbid and I'm not always a fan of happy endings. I think the story would have been better if the villagers fell at the last bastion Natsuno and Toru flee the village the doctor was killed and the final scene was of Toshio rising from his grave to join the ranks of the undead. That would have been absolutely perfect.,394,371,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Storyline is slow and confusing the first few episodes but picks up as it progresses. Animation is wonderful. Last few episodes had me on the edge asking what next!,395,372,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,397,374,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One of the good things about this anime is that it isn't what it seems. Before i decided to try i thought shiki would be a dark typical story of vampires attacking humans and the humans desperately trying to escape. After watching it the anime proved me wrong somehow the anime just keeps you guessing at least for me i couldn't figure out what this anime was about till the second half of the anime.,398,375,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a rather late review of Shiki however I felt that it must be done. The reason that I am posting such a late review even though I watched this anime when it first aired in summer of 2010 is because since the story was really slow you have all the episodes to download at once instead of having to wait the longest week ever! However slow the story is it is also really really great! Besides the story I also love the soundtrack to this anime. That is one of the other things that kept me hooked and wanting to watch. It fits the mood and situations that happen sooo perfectly it's just amazing!! Shiki is the first anime series soundtrack I have ever purchased! My one gripe about the story though is that the ending was left really open so unless there is a second season then the ending leaves you with questions. Another thing that I did not like about this anime was how the characters' eyes looked. It would be ok if only the vampires or shiki had eyes like that but it's not ok when all the characters do. Other than that this anime is one of my favorite in the horror/suspense genre. If you're looking for something in this genre to marathon then I easily recommend this because once you get into you're gonna want to keep watching to see how it develops!,399,376,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Contains vampires and blood.... But starts off real slow I dropped it once halfway thru ep 1 then re picked it up put thru it till about halfway the. I really started to enjoy it. So you have to have some patience for it.,403,380,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Shiki is a mediocre anime with a terrible story and just as many annoying (to downright stupid) characters as there are good ones. The art may make up for some of it but even so this show screams  middle of the pack  so loud that eardrums may burst. Don't get me wrong; if you love vampires have a taste for character driven stories and like anything labled 'horror' then you will probably love Shiki. But unless you are a specific person for which all those conditions are met then this is ultimately a waste of time.,404,381,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series in my opinion is one of the few that manage to have a streak of episodes near the end that all seem to be better than the last and have you wanting more for 5 or so episodes. I will admit that the middle of the series starts to drag a little bit after a strong opening but it is more than worth it.,408,385,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was sceptical about Shiki at first. Vampire anime made after vampires had been turned into useless sparkling sex-symbols? But Shiki brings back all the myths about vampires that have been lost in recent culture. They burn in sunlight they can't enter holy ground and they need permission to enter a house. The setting is a little rural town who's only real export is the wood needed to make funeral poles. Foreshadowing has never been so obvious.,411,386,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Overall this is a beautiful work of art. The animation is beautiful to look at and every song fits perfectly and sounds great. The voice actors were also great. Even though the ending to this anime is not exactly fulfilling the only thing that I would criticize is that there are so many characters that it is hard to keep tract of them all. The characterization is amazing however. You love for the most part every character even the vampires. If you want beautiful music and animation a compelling story that keeps you hooked likeable characters and some gore then this is the perfect anime for you.,412,387,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm not going to go into to much detail about this anime because I can sum it up in about one word. Average.,432,406,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime had a some what good story line to it but in some parts it was really hard to follow. I like that there was a main goal for the main characters to follow. I also like that this anime did not have very main filler episodes. The animation of this anime was fairly good. Some of the characters had really great detail to them along with the scenary. Some of the songs in this anime were really good. I mostly liked the opening song nut the ending song was good too. As for the characters I liked most of them but there were some characters that I wished would go crawl up in a hole and die so I mever have to see them again. Overall this was a some what good anime but I just fell like with this anime that they started it in the misddle of the maon characters story.,433,407,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is an anime it's not bad it's not good it's just there. The story in the start is well a bit confusing. The characters are not that explained well and from episode one there is a lot of back story with little reinforcement. I feel as if this has a lot of inside knowledge since it is based on a video game but to a random viewer without any previous insight it becomes a bit of a mess. ,434,408,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The follow up to the popular first season did not dissapoint. Infact I felt that we got more charcter development in this season than in the last season. This season I related to a bit more since some of the characters where about leave high school for college. Haruka Nanase saw major character development from his first season self. The animation I feel is also better! I sure hope another season will be made so we could see their futures. ,443,416,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I loved this season. I really liked this show from jump but this season is definitely the highlight. It had a better plotline more side characters and a truckload of feels. I hope they do a season 3 because this season was great.,444,417,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I think this season was by far the best. I can't help but feel like there's more that can be done for this no matter how hard I think about it. I might love the ending but I'm also not satisfied with it. There can be another season where Nagisa-chan and Rei-chan are trying to face the reality of Haruka-chan and Makoto-chan not being there all the time. :(,446,419,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a very brief review. If you like supernatural anime than check this out. Takahiro Toru and Tadashi are the Handy Boy Club in which they basically do odd jobs around the school for some kind of compensation. There is an old school building on the grounds that is going to be demolished. The Handy Boy Club decide to clean up the old building. In the old building Takahiro meets an apparition named Saki. Takahiro discovers Saki's relationship to the old building and it's his cause to stop the old building from being demolished with the help of his friends. The school jocks want the building to go down and they are his obstacle. There is also a recurring dream that Takahiro has of a teddy bear he owned as a child that he lost. The rest is for you to discover in this short ova. Bascially this is about the life and soul of things. The story is nothing special. The characters are not developed. It's very simple. The animation is not the best but I would not call it bad either. I liked Saki's character design. The sound was the weakest aspect of this show. Just not good at all. But there is so little that it's not bothersome. If you just want to watch something to kill time and happen to like supernatural anime than give it a look.,465,437,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Considering that this anime is basically just a five minute long song there arent many things that I can judge. What I can say though is that the song art and animation is legitimately terrifying. The song is sung by a little kid as depicted by the animation. The girl sings like a witch and seems slightly homicidal which is awfully frightening. The animation's art looks as if it were done by a seven year old. Overall the song and animation is erie and weird. There isn't much to say about Sumiko but she really doesn't like your attitude.,466,438,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay I watched the whole thing and all I have to say is that it sucked. Really sucked. I swear that the first episode it took about ten minutes for the first word of the whole series to be uttered and then it was another four minutes of silence. Another review I read said to start after the twelth episode and if you have nothing better to do I would recommend that aswell. The story line sucked because it kept jumping back and forth from one thing to another and it left a whole bunch of holes in the story. Definitely not my cup of tea...wouldn't recommend it...,473,445,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I’m not going to put any spoilers... just a recommendation: If you are going to watch this Anime start watching it from episode 12. and I’m been serious.

This is one of the few stories I have seen that after finishing it legitimately gave me bad dreams the next night (not only bad but epicly bad most of which I remembered in the morning). I greatly appreciate that. When you finish this have a comfort blanket and a hot cup of tea ready to go and maybe a friend or two around for support. Do not keep medications or sharp objects near by until you have fully recovered and stay away from bridges and high roof-tops.,484,455,2019-04-13 21:35:39

i dont know what should i say about this anime at the begining i thought that its a good anime with a different story line but after some epsodes i started to hate this anime they entered mecha in it out of nowhere and started to fight with aliens and monsters and i started to think that is this anime is for kids because the way they talk and etc so its up to you you want to watch its or not ,487,458,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,488,459,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The style and animation are beautiful however the story is certainly bizarre. After watching 14 episodes I feel as though there are 3 noticiable arcs. First an introduction to our main characters and the birth of Samuri Flamenco. I enjoyed this and this is why I continued watching the anime. Second we have the appearance of Flamenco girl and the story starts to feel more far-fetched than before as she goes around physically assaulting criminals and using dangerous weapons. Then it seems to turn into something similar to Power Rangers. I am not a fan of The Power Rangers and didn't want to watch something along those lines but the beginning of the anime seemed more of a paraody so I enjoyed the first few episodes. ,489,460,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story? Doesn't matter. Animation? Not good but it does the job well. Nothing else matters all that matters is the Characters. It's a 26 episode anime very long yes but my motavation for watching all episodes was the Characters they are all like-able developed and the series used it's time up well (except episode 13 which was a pointless filler). This is way the anime gets a high rating because of the characters they make the series enjoyable.,503,471,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AHAHAHA. Just thinking about this show makes me laugh. There are some parts you want to cry but 99.9% of the time you will be laughing your head off. I find that this show in particular out of the other stereotypical one's in it;s genre really breaks the mold. And the amount of 4th wall breaking they down is astounding. It's like they just bulldoze right over it and it really just works :),504,472,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ouran High School Host Club (or OHSHC for the purposes of this review) details the story of intellectual protege Haruhi Suzu-I mean Fujioka and her various school life adventures with her fellow club members at the Ouran's High School Host Club in this romantic comedy/slice of life anime.,507,475,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is one of the funniest anime I have ever seen.  I've watched it nine times and it still manages to make me laugh.  It's one of the only anime that made me laugh out loud and its parody of the average shoujo anime is even funnier to me now that I've started watching more and more anime as a (unprofessional/amatuer/just doing it for fun and to share my own thoughts) reviewer.  ,510,478,2019-04-13 21:35:39

To be honest I am thinking about dropping this after seven episodes.,513,481,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: The story follows Haruhi as she acidentally gets forced to enter a male host club. Okay now that have backdrop enter plot..................... I said enter plot............ hello plot..........? There really isn't much of a plot it's most a character driven anime whcih follows without to much direction other then the rich boys are out to something stupid again and the girl countuines to be clues about both her emtions and the guys emtions. Random of it's time to end this anime inconclusive ending. There are some good character developing episodes but they don't get to do much due to the random nature of the story.,514,482,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ouran high school host club was the first anime that i watched and to say its still one of my favorites animes ever. This show is what got e into anime and i prod to say it im sure all of the other people who have watched it agree so if you want a romantic comedy then this is the show for you.,515,483,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ouran will forever be one of my favorite romantic comedy animes. The characters are all so different in personality there is someone for everyone. They mesh together to make a comedic adventure that should have gone on forever. It does deviate from the manga a bit mostly because they wish to end it before it ends up as long as the manga I think. Still it is funny the characters are great the storyline progresses well the music is fitting and upbeat the art is good. I really can't say anything bad about ouran except their refusal to make it cover the entire manga. It is one I will watch in Japanese or English. I have literally lost count of how many times I have watched it. I even made my best friend who hates anime watch it and all she did was laugh and finally admitted anime doesn’t suck. It's that good! I can only really leave you with these two words to describe it. WATCH IT!,518,486,2019-04-13 21:35:39

While relying strongly on comedic cliches Ouran High School Host Club is none the less thoroughly enjoyable. Each of the male characters fits into a anime cliche such as the  small cute one  the  intelligent cool one   or the  narcissistic yet ultimately caring one .  However these stereotypes are recognised and used used as a point of comedic relief. While there is little in the way of a plot line the characters are stong enough to carry the anime the full 26 episodes and still leave you wanting more.,526,494,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It's not the greatest but I loved watching it before going to bed at night. It's great for calming down after a rough day. It appears to be a really feminine show but I don't really enjoy that type of stuff and was able to watch it. The story kind of goes everywhere. How Fujioka is indebted to the host club is mentioned from time to time but the content of the episodes is pretty from one place to the next. Generic art style but the floral are nice.,528,496,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I truly truly love this anime! While it has little in the realm of central plot it does have continuity and coherence.  Each episode is designed to further the relationships of the characters and provide comedy both of which it accomplishes extraordinary well.  I especially love Ouran because of the vast array of characters it has that can always make you laugh!  The animation is clean and I have no complains with the sound.  It's one of those anime that after you see a scene you have to go back and watch the whole episode and once you've seen the whole episode you have to go back and watch the whole series and once you've seen the whole series you have to watch it again... it never gets old. <3  Definitely worth a try.  If you don't feel the first episode however you probably won't enjoy the series.  The flow of the episodes doesn't change much so don't bother going past episode one if it's not your style.,532,500,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I LOVED IT! All of the host club member are my favorite! I have to make this a minimum of 100 characters. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!!,533,501,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ouran was something I started watching because I wanted something that was different. Something that my mom might not like necessarily. In fact I thought she would hate it (she is not into pink and cutie stuff). One day watching ouran (for the second time). Mom wandered into the room and like I predicted she wasn't impressed BUT later that night she had nothing else to watch while she does whatever she does after the kiddes go to bed she watched this from the begininng... and loved it. :D She then converted her best friend (she and two guys from her college love this). My anit anime father even liked it. :P Even though he thought it was very strange. I loved everything about this anime. I still watch this (for like the 6th or 7th time) when I'm working around the house.,539,507,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i really liked this anime!! the plot is good and it has comedy. This story is about a girl named haruhi who is the only poor person in a rich school. but then she breaks an 8000000 yen jar and is order to join the host club to pay back. but here's the thing... haruhi is a GIRL!! they al find out and Tamaki starts to fall in love with haruhi. Also the hitach twins start to like her as well. They have experinces (like tamaki drinking  commerners coffie ) and (haruhi eating  fancy tuna ). in the end Tamaki and haruhi confess to each other (right almost Tamaki was taken away by a rich girl) and its wat i would call a happy ending!!

It made me laugh so hard the only complaint I have is that it's not very long. I wish there were at least 15-20 more episodes. I really loved this anime and I would recommend it to anyone!,543,510,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As hilarious as this will seem coming from a diehard horror/action anime fan I LOVE Ouran High School Host Club. The manga was better thought out story wise but the anime flows and is understandable. Though I don't appreciate the attempt to change the ending but it leaves plenty of room for a second season if that should happen. The plot progression is pretty typical. While the characters are stay pretty strictly to their archetypes Bisco has though them out very well and has given them their own unique qualities. The twins being the best example of this! Overall its a pretty standard romantic comedy. So why do I like it? Ouran has a subtlety that is rare in the genre. There are glimpses of true sincerity and emotion. As a writer Bisco is not perfect but she wants her audience to fully connect with her characters and their experiences. Its very relatable and awkward. Ouran also has the complicated theme of disconnection and family turmoil within high ranking families. Which can be a hard thing to portray in a comical anime/manga. While there is resolution for each of the characters the beauty is in the things that aren't said. There is a lot of things the reader has to read between the lines to understand and that gives this anime a particular depth. Its a hard thing to describe but it makes the plot and characters more real... They truly have a life of their own. And that is fascinating and interesting to experience because as a viewer and as a reader one must invest a bit of themselves into the series. While the anime doesn't quite do the manga justice its worth watching. In fact I was first introduced to the series by watching the anime first. I will say you will have to at least watch through to episode 6 or 7 at least to get a sense of understanding and connection to the characters. ,551,517,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I love this anime!! The story is full of rediculous fun and the characters are interesting. It extremely playful and funny. The caracthers get into all kinds of trouble and I only wish that there was a second season to see more of the antics that the host club gets up to. Haruhi has all the sense of a normal person trapped in the world of the rich and powerful. All of the other characters are virtually clueless when it comes to the life of an ordinary person and their adventures into  commoners  things make the show that much more entertaining. I loved the spontaneous story and clever characters.,556,522,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Great series and looking forward to starting the nexteason. Very pleasantly surprised at how good this was. Totally blew myxpectations away. Honestly I could still watch this if it was only about Sachikond Yumi the entire time. The whole cast has interesting stories and they’rell not as perfect as they were first brought out to be. Very happy with theay this turned out. And the chibi shorts that I watched recapping the seasonere HILARIOUS. I couldn’t stop laughing n any of them they were priceless.,563,529,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Plot:  For the young women at the Lillian private school for girls nothing is more prestigious than Rosa Sinensis Rosa Gigantea and Rosa Foetida the beautiful and talented women who head the student council. When a young girl named Yumi's path is intertwined with Sachiko a successor to the council things will never be the same for the both of them. Maria-sama ga Miteru is a quiet tale of forbidden romance friendship and the everyday life of a school girl.  (site synopsis),564,530,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was somewhat annoyed in the first few episodes the way theharacters acted felt very forced (probably my culture-shock fromegular to shoujo anime >_>). That feeling went away after aouple of episodes and I actually started caring for the characters.,565,531,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I wish I could say had good things to say about it but I don't. It's suppose to benother comedy/slice-of life. All I got from it was thelice-of-life...

Well no you probably aren't thinking that you're probablyhinking: what the heck is hidamari sketch?! Well it's a show aboutour girls doing nothing but it's kinda like watching a dysfunctionalffeminate family with an aunt who needs to grow up. she's an adultow stop acting like you're a student. Also Hiro is voiced by yukooto also known as the voice of mikuru asahine. Incidentally this islso a very pretty anime with lovely and soft visuals only gay menould not like it.

My  career  of otaku has begun with harems... (yeah i am a disgusting person) but i was surprised with Kimikiss because JC Staff did exactly what i thought that was impossible... they turned a Harem plot into a great ROmance. The seyuus did a good work the animation (wel i am not good at it) is nice. THe most important is the way the story flows it has two main characters and two heroines per male so there are two love triangles.,577,542,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I came across Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun on this website.  I was looking for some good school life Rom-Coms and this was at the top of the list.  I actually watched a bit of the first episode one time but I wasn't in the mood so I stopped.  I watched some other anime and got right back into this.  Thank goodness I did.,586,550,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love how this started out as a romantic comedy and they seem to have decided to hell with the romance and go straight for the comedy instead. This series has a very diverse set of characters in which everyone can relate too. By far one of the best comedy series of 2014. It’s a good show to watch if you need a good laugh or two.,587,551,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A wonderful romance story with incredable character development and an absolutly hilarious situational comady to boot. The opening theme is one of my favourite themes of all time. The animation and art style is crisp clean and very attractive. Overall I would give Gekkan Shoujo 10/10 and put it as my favourite RomCom anime of all time.  ,590,554,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I enjoyed the anime but my only problem is that the heroine doesn't get her Love because Nozomi is an airhead of the biggest degree. Which is why I don't really recommend it. Though if you enjoy anime's where the heroine has unreachable love relations with the male-lead this is just for you. ,595,559,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love this anime its a romantic comedy that allows characters to be annoying oblivious normal romantic all emotions you can imagine. I love the animation especially the emotions from the characters are designed very well. I enjoy they have a prince character thats a female !,596,560,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is byfar one of my favorite animes. The characters make you connected and relatable and the ships. So many ships. This anime has its own fleet of ships. I find most shoujos silly and full of cringe worthy tropes yet this finds the fine line between too silly and too shipy. The show follows Chiyo and her attempts to tell her true feelings to the robotic manga writer/artist Nozaki. Anyway there are adventures with a great cast of characters who all go to the same school but are in different grade. Anyway this show got me so addicted to all the ships I had to read the manga which is also a great read. So I recommend Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun for it brings smiles laughs a few cringes and sassy senpais. ,597,561,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"I absolutely loved this anime. It was funny charming the characters were interesting and you really rooted for the characters to all get happy endings. The show had me laughing so hard every episode I couldn't breathe at some points. ",598,562,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This was one of the weirdest anime I've seen. There was no strong story line. It was messy sometimes. That being said it was really hilarious. The series is episodic it's easy to follow weird and funny. Each character is unique and have traits that make them likeable. Overall I think it would be a good anime to watch if you just want to laugh without thinking much. Oh and I did like the opening song!,602,566,2019-04-13 21:35:39
STORY,603,567,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Gekkan Shojo Nozaki-kun starts off powerful with the comedy but as it progressed into the second half most of the jokes got less funny and waned. ,604,568,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,605,569,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My reviws may be short and not often. But after getting bored with some knockoffs over and over  I found this rather refreshing. It does have a mixed feeling of Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero (Hagure Yuusha no Estetica) Freezing and Fate/Zero with a little slice of life/ high school added for flavor and a touch of un-nude fan service to boot. However the whole super over-power save the day (going Super Sayain mode style) can get redundent. But showing spell casting time is closer to a real D20 RPG's as opossed to 'insta-casting' stuff over and over is nice.  If World Break: Aria of Curse for a Holy Swordsman isn't up to your taste check out the other 3 for sure.,606,570,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story - It started out like it was going to go somewhere but then it just failed after he regains his memories. Its like the producers tried to drag the anime along as long as possible. I help up with it until they got to the point where the Russian steriotype came in. (Isnt that a thing that only stupid American shows do?!?),607,571,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is great and I hope there is way more. The characters are very funny and good and the main character does have the normal over powered like in every other anime but its really cool how they expand on it. The idea they have come up with for the story and characters is really cool. You could make lots of story lines out of what they have to play around wiht. I hope this anime keeps getting made over all,608,572,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story is great but putting the fighting scene of the end into the first is a bad idea i tought the thunderstorm helix is his strongest move but its not if they did not put that fight in the beggining i'll give it a 9.,609,573,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The charakters are really easy to understand (emotionaly) and are very passionate. The story is easy to keep track of and it gave me goosebumps and made me hoping for a second season. I love watching these types of anime and would love to hear from others recommending these types of anime to me. :D Great anime to watch so please support my idea of a second season.

Overall it's fun to watch decent enough story no an overkill amount of fanservice well animated.,613,577,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is a  one man against the world  type of show he has powers far beyond anyone elses and wants to change the world with it. It also has a sweet romance story with his past life. Lots of action and awe inspiring moments. You should definetly WATCH THIS!!!,614,578,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Overall I thought it was a decent anime. It has a lot of faults but I'm still hoping for a second season. I do stuggle with 12 episode animes though because I feel like most of them don't work in such a short time as well as they could if they had more time.,615,579,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is among the worst show that was possibly aimed at my audience. Its annoyingly fanservacy and much of it goes nowhere which is okay for a school slice of life but not an action anime.,616,580,2019-04-13 21:35:39

" Seikon no Qwaser is a tricky mistress. ",618,582,2019-04-13 21:35:39
this is an amazing anime the story is exeptionally brilliant however the thing that gets me it the way in which the qwaser get their power is soon changed from an erotic meaning to an emediate obsession. yes i am talking about the way that the qwaser suck a females breast in order to obtain power is not a good thing for it creates an odd air and leaves me at times disturbed with how things get out of hand fast. i got to the point of objecting to the power way after about ep 1. the author couldnt think of a more moralistic way to do things? seriously? anyways the rest was definately fonaminal. the story was execptionaly well done. the chacters were great and the powers followed chemestry perfect. The soundtracks are something to truely behold for they blend with the background character expressions and time perfectly. the action is also something that is truely fenaminal. the ways in which the metals and other elements are also first class.,619,583,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Although I am guiltily enjoying this anime I keep correcting them on their chemistry. Sometimes it sucks to be a science nerd. When the tit sucking began I almost got whiplash from a violent nosebleed and I'm still not entirely used to it. I mean people sucking virgin breasts for power? Can I just point a couple of things out? Good:,621,585,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is possibly one of the most confusing and retarded anime that I have possibly watched. Though the synopsis descirbes the anime as a battle between Qwasers who are able to control elements in the periodic table this anime is far from it. If I had to classify this anime in one word it would not be action magic nor sci-fi but BOOBS.,626,590,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ok so as you see this got a 5 So i was wondering if you have the name Makoto does that mean you will always be a sex adict cuz i school days he was and in this he was. I do think that this Makoto was nice though. He did care for Yura and i think thats great. At the start they seemed like a real newlywed couple but then they went over the top. Anyway all i can say is me and my wife(if i get one) will never be that sex crased. Anyway this is a good seres for those major echhi fans so i guess thats what you guys wanted to hear so see ya,635,598,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When I first read the Futari Ecchi synopsis I thought it sounded pretty good. But I usually like to read one or two reviews as well before I spend my time on a new anime especially an ecchi one (we all know they can be the worst of the worst sometimes). So when I saw GnarlyCranium's review claiming that  this series depicts one of the most thoughtlessly cruel vile codependent and abusive relationships imaginable and what's more it's presented as if this is normal and healthy  and read the suggestion to  Just find some tentacle rape hentai to watch instead. That would be far more wholesome.  I got pretty worried. But after deciding to proceeding with caution I found that nothing could be farther from the truth!,636,599,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A mid-20s sweet virginal newlywed couple learn together how to make love. So vanilla it burns but quite explicit. Sounds nice and harmless doesn't it?,637,600,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This such a good and awesome anime. I love this anime because it has a really good story line to it. It also sticks to one main goal for most of the characters. The animation of the anime is super good. I love that the characters and the scenary is so well detailed. I love the music in this anime. I also love the voices of some of the characters. I love most of the characters because they are really awesome people and they are well developed through out the anime. I love just really love this anime period and that is why it gets 9.5/10.,646,605,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a really impressive anime given the year it was made (1930). This anime actually had voices for the characters. All the others I have watched from around this time period only have sounds of flutes or drums in the background for music. This anime actually had a story too! I don't know why you people gave it such a bad score this is really impressive! Remember this was 85 years ago!!!,649,608,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you are looking for a romance anime that isnt all about the little mishaps within a relationship that seem to happen in every other romance anime then this anime is for you. a VERY unique story with unique characters and unique mishaps that may disrupt the relationship but an even more unique way of  those mishaps getting solved ive never seen what this anime did it put WEIRD and ABNORMAL in with romance and they made it WORK.,664,620,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"I enjoyed C3 and this is no C3. There are no tactics almost no battles personal or otherwise. And they are openly and completely unapologetic for it.  What they do have is complete and over the top laugh out loud humor.  The animation is pretty normal and the characters are unencumbered by any sort of personal history or baggage. There are 3 individual and unrelated vignettes per episode. But oh my god is this thing funny. It’s both crass and imaginative. The airsoft part of it is almost irrelevant other than a vehicle to give the characters guns with which to shoot each other with. And there is no guarantee that they will even be used in every story.  Don’t watch this for the airsoft. Watch it for the lollies with the hand strength of eastern mountain gorillas.

I received this show for Secret Santa 2014. The first thing first; whoever you are who told me this was a slice of life: it is not. This is a comedy show that is split into 2 or 3 individual parts an episode. This being a comedy however gives me trouble since reviewing comedy is more difficult than any other genre. ,668,624,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Maison Ikkoku is an old fashion anime. From its take on relationships to how the characters relate and respond to romance you would probably expect this anime to have been done in the 60s. Now mind you if you love old anime Maison Ikkoku is pretty ok but if your spreading your wings into older content then this shouldn't be your first stop. This anime is very slow and whimsical when it comes to plot progression.,677,631,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hhahahahahaha if ya like funny then this is not for you. Unless of course you watch the english version..and in that case put your bed pan under you. It makes it even funnier once you discover that the original was a serious series....but who wants that when you watch this provocative side splitting series that rekindled my love of innocent perversion,686,639,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was expecting a little bit more from this. I watched The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya some years ago and honestly I don't remember much except that I didn't dislike it. I guess I was attracted to the title sounded like something Lovecraft would write dark and mysterious. So I watched the show waiting for the moment Nagato Yuki would disappear maybe whisked off to some parallel world; and waiting patiently for it to get more interesting - I had to wait till episode 10 (out of 16) for her to disappear; and sorry to say but it didn't get more interesting. And anyway after 2 or 3 episodes she comes back. So no cause for concern.,687,640,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. If you're a Haruhi fan I'm sure this title grabbed your attention just like it did mine. Most of the series fans feel some sort of endearment towards Nagato Yuki and the thought going into the series is that we'll get more of her shy charm like what was experienced in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya right? Well...kinda.,691,644,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is in a simmilar line with Zetsubou Sensei and like you'll see there's precious little that needs animation here. The majority of the skits take place back stage in a  rakugo  theater a traditional format of Japanese comedy. The girls each have a diffrent personality that really accepts one another. If you are a fan of Japanese culture puns and banter then you will love this show. I was actually laughing out loud at some of the scenes... Marii punching a door-to-door religious recruiter was absolutly priceless (episode 2). ,694,647,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This show has started interestingly but soon became redundant. I watched this show as a kid. I was hoping it would be just like the game. But even at 10-12 years old I found it so childish and boring. Ash never catched any Pokemon. Why does he keep saying he will? So many stupid episodes that are supposed to be humorous but are not. Team Rocket always are  blasted away . It the same thing over and over again. It isn't nearly as cool as the video game. This show might be good for toddlers and children ages maybe 1-5. It is just so horrible.,704,650,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pokemom is a childrens Anime about a boy named Ash whos main goal is to capture animal like creatures called pokemon. Pokemon means Pocket Monsters. The story is not great but it is likeable. Ash is followed by 2 other companions. Brock who is a gym trainer that Ash deafeted in a battle and Misty a very grouchy girl mainly because Ash broke her bike. The characters are somewhat stupid in ways but it works out when you put Team rocket in the picture. Team Rocket are the bad guys of the show but have a likeable side to them. They are the funniest characters of Pokemon. The Animation is not that perfect but does show in the effects of the Pokemon. The sound is good in its own right. The songs are very well done and play a very good part in the emotion of some episodes like  Pikachus goodbye  Overall pokemon is more of a kid show but it still one that we will all remember,705,651,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Pokemon is one of the most loved anime so far everybody loves PIKACHU! it is about a couple of kids on a quest to find out all the pokemon and some of the kids are on a quest to be the best trainer and even breeder pokemon is a very very cute anime the way anime is supposed to be cute and adorable!,708,654,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Call me biased but I have a special relationship with the first anime I ever watched.  It spawned a childhood obsession with an anime game series and lifestyle that helped me to survive grammar school.  It holds a special place in not only my own but many other people's hearts.  Whether it's the game the anime the manga or all three people care about it really is something special.,711,657,2019-04-13 21:35:39

In my boyhood I loved Pokemon but even at the young age of 10 or so I realised about 100 episodes in that they're all the same. Now a lot most or even all anime are forumlaic to some degree but most don't go on for a few hundred episodes and are less formulaic. The formula is this:,713,659,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I thought it was great but overall I thought the battle scenes were kinda cool but to be honest the part I really hated about this show was the emotional scenes but yeah I liked this anime for the most part. I've loved it since I was 7 so it's kinda like a favorite I still love it and think it's awesome.,714,660,2019-04-13 21:35:39

One of the best anime produced in 2011 by a wide margin. No. 6 offers the combination of a well thought out science fiction view of a dystopian future a strong supporting cast of relevant characters backing up the struggle of the two protagonists Nezumi and Sion well executed animation and an outstanding voice cast.,734,675,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story was very emotional however the ending wasn't what most viewers were expecting.,736,676,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Now let me start off by saying that I'm rating this as compared to the light novel it was based off of and will often reference the light novel.  Though I try to keep spoilers out of my reviews I might need to include some slight ones (though I'll try to be as vague as possible) to explain why I gave it the rating it got.,738,677,2019-04-13 21:35:39
No. 6 is a story about a utopian society that thrives on providing for the greater good.  The people of No. 6 live a peaceful life.  Sion an adolescent male accidentally jeopardizes his status in the city by helping and harboring an injured boy whom he helps escape.  Years later Sion learns of a strange plague that is consuming people within the city.  Before he knows what's happening he is a fugitive on the run trying to escape the police.  Nezumi the boy he helped earlier in life comes to save him and takes Sion outside of No.6 and into the real world.  The remainder of the story focuses on Sion's inner growth and desire to save No.6 from the disease consuming it along with his friends and family.,740,678,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This Anime is Awsome due to its easy to understand storyline 11 part season 1 excellent clear voice acting excellent tone used for each emotions and siuations by the voice actors the sharp crisp and clear sound used for this anime but the animation can be improved by adding more facial expressions to mach up with the voice actors tone usage for each situation.,746,682,2019-04-13 21:35:39

No. 6 puts an awesome spin on the typical story of an untopoia. What I realy enjoyed about this series was the deep emotions of each character. Their relationships and how each character responds to a situation expresses their unique methods in dealing with their world.,748,684,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Allright. It's been a while since I've done something like this so bear with me as I try to find my way again.I did quite a lot of them in the past on a different website which you can find here: http://legendsofsatura.net/index.php/forum125/6-reviewing-guild.html,749,685,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was one of the first animes I had ever watched when I first decided to explore anime. I decided to pick it up because at that time it had just recently finished airing and the series finale just happened to be on the day before my birthday. What kept me dedicated to watching it was not the fact that it was only a mere 11 episodes but because it was so interesting and I was already starting to like some of the characters I just couldn’t stop after I started. It was this anime that turned me into an anime fan in the first place so it will always have a special place in my heart.,750,686,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really really liked this anime and I don't know why. I can only guess there's something specific to my soul that was touched here. Because on the surface I can really see why most people would not like this.  It's one of those animes that is basically split in half- the first half is one thing and the second half the whole thing just goes flying off the rails. You think you have started to figure out where they're going with this and you're excited to see what's going to happen and then it's like they took 4 or 5 of their ideas for an ending and just threw them all in there. so yeah the ending leaves you a bit unsatisfied and kind of squinting at the screen.  but the first episode is quite gripping and very very ominous as if something is coming something is about to happen. the rest of the show goes off in several directions that annoyed me because i thought it could have been a lot better if they had focused on one plot point and then took it further like at least 20 episodes.  but really what i loved was the relationship between shion and nezumi.  a lot of people will call this yaoi but i truly didn't think of it that way. i thought of it more of a bond.  you see this in a few movies/tv shows/animes/books from time to time. a bond that you can't really explain so it will just default to sexual for most people. but it's different. it's something that draws two people to each other and makes them extremely protective and possessive of each other. it's an energy an understanding it's something that only those two people can feel. people that want to drown together. anyhow i enjoyed the way the hardened nezumi had a soft spot for shion. he showed jealousy and deep feeling and protected him throughout the show. i especially loved when he told him that he didn't want him to change and became completely distraught when he saw shion begin to become like him. it was some really profound human interpersonal stuff that I always enjoy.  I suppose my unique experiences have made me able to appreciate this as such but again I can see how most people will just dismiss this as stupid or gay.  i absolutely loved the opening and ending songs as well. the animation is quite stunning for just one scene at the correctional facility the rest of the animation is just normal.  ,752,688,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Dont watch unless you've seen the rest of the series! May contain slight spoilers if you're not far enough along.  I liked how there were many different character cameos in this special.  And the ending got me way too cute and sweet.  Nothing mind blowing but fit with the series and was adorable.,760,696,2019-04-13 21:35:39

My review for the 2009 comedy/harem/ecchi anime Seitokai No Ichizon.,763,699,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I got to say Seitokai no Ichizon was interesting. Not for its story characters animation or music but how it used popular anime a comedic way. I couldn’t recognize all of them but I did recognize most of them. Off the top of my head I got Dragonball K-on Bleach and the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.,764,700,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I honestly wanted to watch a something funny again. Expecting just a Parody Anime(by watching the introduction of the first episode you won't think that there will be any serious moments) I was surprised to get so much more.,765,701,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This has got to be one of the most boring animes I have ever watched. I'm not familiar with the original story i.e. light novel or manga. However I can honestly say that after forcing myself to go through the first 6-7 episodes this show was just plain boring.,766,702,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,767,703,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This actually became a lot better the further in it went.he first few episodes were decent. Nothing to be surprised about and wereairly boring. But then some “drama” started to occur mixed in with the comedynd it got a lot better then it originally was. The last episode was prettyood as well I might add. I personally loved the way Mafuyu was handled in its well as Sugisaka haha. Overall this was a pleasing show to watch in theong run.,769,704,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is the perfect anime for those who love the no storyline and parody genre. The activities of the Hekiyou Academy Student Council consist of them constantly trying to dodge their responsibilities from both within and without the Student Council room. Every single character is likeable from the very start and you develop quite an atachement to each as the series goes on. The music is superb and the opening songs is one of my favorite of all time. Overall Seitokai No Ichizon is worth your time and it has one of the highest rewatchabililty qualities that I've encountered in anime. I have watched every episode at least 5 times now and they always make me laugh hysterically. Now for spoiler reasons I have to say that this anime does sometimes spoil other shows by parodying them but if that's not a big thing for you then enjoy!! Please watch this anime because it is so worthy of your time.,771,706,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't feel like writing a long review so I'll just say that this has got to be one of the funniest anime I've ever watched. It's consistently funny too.,773,707,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As someone who generally dislikes fantasy settings the first season of Hitsugi no Chaika was surprisingly one of the more enjoyable anime of Spring 2014 so picking up the sequel was a no-brainer. Hearing that it was only 10 episodes long and that it would be an anime-original ending was worrisome… but hey that just gives me more to look forward to once the anime is over! So I went ahead and started watching.,777,709,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really really wanted to like this show. Sadly it didn't end up that way. I didn't see the purpose of their pacing. It is one of the slowest shows I've seen. If you are going to make something have a slow pace then you need to do it right. I think they didn't do it right at all. I kept falling asleep so by the end of the show I literally had no idea what was going on. Th ending seemed kind of cool but like I said I had no idea what was happening. I would need to watch it again to catch the stuff I slept through but I really don't want to have to sit through it again.,789,718,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The anime to trump all animes. This got me into anime in the first place. Just the pure fights would get my blood pumping and put me on the edge of my seat. Yea yea all that cliche charging stuff but if you had the ability to create a ball of plasma strong enough to destroy galaxies wouldnt it take a while to charge? Anyway this is number 1 because I know if I want badass fights I turn to this anime. and there are many character to like in this anime. Its not all fighting and yelling ya know,817,739,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Dragon Ball Z(DBZ) is an action Anime like no other. At 1st glance at DBZ it may look like any other Fighting Anime/Manga but the Characters of DBZ and there emotion drives the story forward. The story of DBZ is placed years after Dragon Ball(DB).,818,740,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So Dragonball Z. Well first of all there were a few things that I did not like about it. I hated how long it took for something to happen. Its like in 20 episoude only 5 minutes pass. Another thing how goku would always come late after everyone is almoust dead. And in some episoudes I just could not handol how stupid chichi was and how she couldent understand. But I really did enjoy Dragonball very much. It was very funny. The story was very confussing at some time. But this anime did cought my heart sometimes. It is really touching how kind moust of the characters in the anime are specially goku. Even whit the timeing been a little off it stile wasent bad it was stile fun to watch.,819,741,2019-04-13 21:35:39
dragon ball z is the best anime ever. goku is my favorite of all characters. he is the best of the best. In dragon ball he was the main hero. In dbz he tries to make the younger generation capable of handling heroic deeds but still be be hero himself as well. In gt he is what he is to be pure hearted superior and immmortal too and become the best he really is. goku made friends out of evil people who nobody else could have befriended like piccolo and espicially vegeta. people hate him because he's pureharted and genorous and he alyays is the nightmare of any villan. but for me for him being extremly purehearted and still saving the day makes him the best of the best. beside goku i like my favorite villan frieza and favorite rival vegeta. but goku is like infinity and is way far above both of them combined. I like the others wants a new dbz saga where goku kicks bills whis and every other strongest characters in 12 other universes. yup some thing like that and perhaps gt characters can exist in the other verses but even stronger but goku can still beat them,820,742,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,821,743,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Dragon Ball Z for me probably like a lot of other people out there was proabably among the very first anime we ever saw and was mostly responsible for getting us into anime.  Which strictly speaking is mostly likely one of the main reasons why I rate this anime so highly.  Looking back now it wasn't anywhere near the greatest thing ever created even for the time when it came out and yet regardless of that.  If it hadn't been DBZ then it is unlikely that I would be watching anime today.  Then again I probably would have stumbled across anime regardless of whether I watched DBZ or not but it did introduce me to anime a lot earlier then when I might have found it.  That being said the action isn't anywhere near the greatest thing out there and throw in some very lame enemies and the series quickly begins to show all the holes in it.  Also considering the fact that the story had so many problems with it like for example how it seemed that no matter how many times certain individuals died they could always be wished back to life presents only one of the many problems I had with the story especially when considering the fact that I had these problems when I was still only a kid.  But still you have to give DBZ credit for what it did for not only me but probably many other people out there.,822,744,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Hands down one of the greatest anime created completed my childhood. Rewatching it again more recently it still captures the child in me and proceeds to captivate me. If you have not seen it yet I highly recommend it.,823,745,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Dragon Ball Z holds a special place in my heart because it was the first anime I actually ever watched and got hooked on.  Its a good story line and it really hooks you in with all the action.  I like all the characters for the most part except for Cell but I love watching how they overcome obstacles and train and get challenged.  Everyone should watch it!,824,746,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Dragon Ball and its sequel series was one of first anime I've seen as boy. Since then a lot of time passed and I've seen many other animes. I got up bit sober when looking at this anime and I've watched it again in Japanese.,827,748,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is definitely a good anime and will work over well with little kids.  It follows the story of Animal Crossing Wild World pretty closely with quite a bit of comedy. The characters are well done animation is Ok but the the Music is VERY good. Over all it is most certainly a must watch for all Nintendo Fans but it could use a little improvement.  ,828,749,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When I first discovered this movie I was excited and ready to watch it! I really love the game series of Animal Crossing and watching this movie was really the best. They definitely put in a lot of references from the game and that really made me happy :D The characters seen in an animated version was also very adorable. I really loved and enjoyed it.,830,750,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sin mucho que variar y sin mucho que contar seguimos teniendo los mimos resultados técnicos vistos en la primera película un CGI muy bien empleada pero que me sigue resultando molesto que lo utilicen inclusos en las caras de los personajes cuando estos están en batalla les hace tener una apariencia espantosa.

"The latest incarnation of the classic Robotecheries celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Macross franchise. I like theay they preserved the textures from the original while vastly updating thection sequences with incredible computer enhancements. Many story elements inhis series were very similar to the original from Alto's rescue of Rankareminiscent of Rick's rescue of Minmei) to the beauty pageant to the wide usef song playing a pivotal role in battles. But this was a unique story overall very gripping story with fantastic character dynamics and beautifulnimation. Truly a masterpiece and a joy to watch.      ",840,760,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Macross Frontier is a creative yet cliché story allowing a fantastic merge of sci-fi and music. It's got the classic love triangle and the one hot guy two very different girls fight over but the detailed tiny twists really get you. Like the fact that those you girls KNOW they fight over one guy and yet they genuinely like each other as friends or the creative unseen past of the main character (that guy they're both in love with) that i swear you will not see coming. If any of you have read the official review it says that this anime loses lots of points for the lack in good storyline but i see it as a common storyline but with good original twists. Frankly i would not recommend this anime to hardcore meccha fans but shojo fans aching for something out of the highschool-love-story senario or people who just love good music.,842,762,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Disclaimer: This is the second review I've written (the first was a few days ago) even though I've been on this site for a year (I know right? took me long enough).  I'm not really that great at writing these things (much better at writing code then writing essays) but hopefully you'll find something useful in this review and if not check out one of the other reviews (personally I thought the one by sothis was pretty good),853,771,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"This OVA was among the first Japanese anime I ever watched twice and the second time I watched it the pacing and the unfolding progression of the mysteries in the story still captured my imagination. The music was perfect for the sense of ennui and nostalgia that were evoked and the emotional climax was powerful and profound. The animation style was very good but took second pace to the mood and story progress.  Some younger viewers might think this anime is rather unspectacular but the emotional subtexts of this message speak loud and clear to a more aged sensibility. Perhaps with age one can more honestly value the simple innocent expressions of longing remorse and hope that I found endearing.  I think sothis' review is right on. This is highly-rewatchable anime that will grow deeper with experience and REALLY makes me want to know what happens beyond the ending. ",854,772,2019-04-13 21:35:39

To Love-Ru is a story about everyone trying to get a spiky-haired ginger's penis. ,864,781,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I had heard so much about To-Love-Ru and how good it was when it came out I had to see it. Boy was that a mistake! As a long-time anime fan (since the late 1980s) I have never seen such a blatent rip-off of an anime by another anime. This anime is just a blatent rip-off of the classic Urusei Yatsura. I think the people who really enjoyed this one never heard of Urusei Yatsura. At least in Urusei Yatsura the jokes were funny. ,865,782,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The anime has a great premise and the first 7ish episodes are very well done but then the anime seems to run out of idea's and keeps on introducing random characters who get pumped off at the end of the episode (making that episode pointless); To Love-Ru just has too many filler episodes for me to recomed it however it has a great lead female and a very funny suporting cast as well as some scenes of subtle character development.,867,784,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i came into to love-ru very nearly completely blind but after just one day i'm actually kind of getting pissed off with it and that's coming from someone who thinks that the fucking star wars prequels were quite good. i've watched half a season now and i have to say i'm really not rooting for much in it anymore. because the main plot device throughout the series is awkward situation after awkward situation after awkward situation over and over again it was funny the first couple of times but it's just getting old now because there's nothing more unfunny than a joke being told about a thousand trillion times over.,868,785,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Básicamente es un episodio común y corriente de Gintama. Tampoco lo ubicaría como si fuera de los mejores. La OVA salió como producto para le Jump Festa 2005 para los que no saben la Jump Festa es un festival creado por Shueisha donde se introducen OVAS de animes que están por ser emitidos o actual mente son emitidos también se promociona mercaderíamangas y video juegos.,872,788,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is by no means bad. Before watching anything you generally need to set your expectations. For this series you can count on my help. Minor spoilers only if any.,873,789,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I have never seen an anime so unrepentantly sexual and yet so gratuitously censored.  I'm pretty sure in one scene they blurred out a kiss deemed too sensual viewers.  What's the point?  Half this show is obscured by light blurs steam yellow censored bands and stupid cardboard cutouts of the characters.  In its present state this show didn't need to be made and until it finds it way to DVD or the web uncensored it certainly doesn't need to be watched.,874,790,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'll write this review based on the uncensored version which not only includes that censored bits of the images but whole missing scenes.,875,791,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is almost same as High School DxD not story wise but the eechi factor. Too much of mature content. Story is not that much strong. Chracters are well made and too much of fan service.,876,792,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was drawn in by the story in the 1st episode but this got kind of werid pretty fast. The main character began to look like a man later in the series. I love paranormal and supernatural aspects of anime titles and this hit the nail on the head but I wish the story board for each episode was bigger and better meaning the plot could have been better.,877,793,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A couple of weeks ago I was questionned if my name was some kind of Clannad anagram. He then proceeded to flame me on the forum for some unknown reason at the time.

I was pleasantly surprised with what I got but I've seen some mixed reviews based on this title. So without hesitation lets dive in.,878,794,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Was it me or was I the only one who didn't particularly like Clannad?  For me the STORY was great.  I held high hopes for this anime because it was from the same company that created AIR - one of my favorite animes of all time.  However I felt very let down.  I think I expected a lot more from Clannad like vague ties coming together in the end to make a lot of sense but instead I felt like I was watching a school anime (which in it's defense it pretty much was).  But I am a plot-anime girl and if a plot isn't strong then I have to rely on the characters and I rarely like animes that make me do that.,885,801,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Aw. This was really good. I'm excited for After Story although I hear its sad. Honestly this one was sad too. Particularly episodes 9 and 15. It makes me leery to see the  sad  part of this gorgeous story if those that took place this season weren't considered that sad. I think the best part about the anime is the characters. I especially loved Fuko but its tough to choose favorites when all the characters are wonderful. I found most of the show to be really funny. Towards the end I was a little confused how some of the things would come together and yes it got a bit cheesy but the show is so good that it doesn't matter. The Dango Daikazoku song is my favorite but all the music is good and the voice acting is absolutely brilliant. I really enjoyed the little extra at the end also. It was cute. ,887,803,2019-04-13 21:35:39

All I have to say is that this anime is the most amazing one I have EVER seen in my life! It is second only to Clannad~After Story which is amazing as well!,889,805,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really love this anime. Both the Japanese and English voice actors did an amazing job. ,890,806,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I never intended to watch Clannad because the friend who recommended it said it was a very depressing anime. However the same friend then forced me to put it on my computer and I figured since it was there I may as well watch some of it and if it was too depressing then I would simply stop watching it. However this ended up being easier said than done. This anime while very emotional and dramatic has several high points that bring joy and laughter to almost all audiences. When the chapters start to reach their climax they strike an emotional chorde which always manages to bring a tear to my eye. It is almost unnatural how thi anime manages to perfectly balance out its saddening drama with comic relief and cheerful joy. With the high quality ofthe story and the true depth of the characters it was no surprise that after watching the first chapter of the anime I found myself hooked to the anime and continually clicking next on my media player at the end of each episode. In the end this season managed to finish itself with a bang with although an easily predicted occurence perhaps one of the most emotional moments in the entire season. I would recommend Clannad to everyone I know no matter what their anime preference is because I know that it has the ability to drag just about anyone into its tear-jerking emotion filled world.,891,807,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Clannad is one of the most beautiful animes ever made. The story is amazing and will bring you a mix of different emotions. But this anime is a real tear jerker. Especially when you watch After Story. Each character is so well developed and they go into the back stories of them. (Kotomi's backstory made me cry hard) Clannad goes into real world things such as dealing with the loss of a parent and raising a child as a single parent. The soundtrack is just gorgeous too. ,892,808,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is the best anime I have ever seen. The animation is great as is everything else about it. If you are looking for a tear-jerker but also something that will make you laugh (a lot - even by yourself) then this is the perfect anime. Once you watch it you will definitely have to watch Clannad After Story. This is one where you can sit down and you could watch episodes all day and still want more. It's GREAT! Please watch.,894,810,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Be prepared to cry from about halfway through until the end of After Story. This anime touched on so many nerves that it was insane but at the same time I just had to finish it. I don't think I've ever seen an anime that made me have an emotional connection with it's characters like this one. The main characters were flawed yep endearing sickingly sad and yet so blindly happy. These characters had an amazing level of depth to them they seemed real. And the story. The story was engrossing in that while the  high school sweet-heart is now my wife  bit that is so common it was done in a way that makes you think about not just what life is like with them but what is life like when them are snatched away from you. A real tear-jerker but still worthwhile all the same.,896,812,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I loved this! The story was great. I loved the different character arcs. I was reading some other reviews and saw people did not like the animation that much. But I thought it was fine. So what if the eyes are big or not realistic. Thats the point in Animation. I enjoy Anime because of the non-reality aspects. But I also love anime with a bit of realism. And Clannad has both! I could relate to a lot of the situations in it. I also loved the OP music. It is a great song and works perfect for this Anime. Overall I loved it.

I love this anime. When I first started it I got so into it that I couldn't stop it just drags you onto the next episode. Not only this Clannad but aso Clannad After Story. Just one thing do not watch the special episode cause it is so confusing and completely opposite to the story.

I'm so in love with Clannad. It's a really good anime in my opinian. It really surprised me. I usually know anime's preatty well. I can usually tell whats going to happen but in this anime it was full of surprices that I enjoyed. Overall the characters where very funny. Its not a 10/10 just because somethings could have changed in a better way but its stile preatty good. I was preatty shock because this was the first anime that actiolly made me cry. It wassent as emotional as the second clannad but stile very emotional.,919,835,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I definitely recommend Clannad.  It's very relaxing and not very exciting but very tender.  Actually the first time I tried watching it I fell asleep.  But I gave it another shot and I'm very glad that I did!,929,843,2019-04-13 21:35:39
All I heard about Clannad before watching it was how tragic the story was.  I was highly unimpressed.  Though it did have it's moments making watchers shed a few tears here and there most of the series was filler.  It's mostly comedy instead of tragedy.  I spent the whole series waiting for sad things to happen but all I really got was a harem about the daily life of a Japanese teenager nothing I haven't seen before.,930,844,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I first began this anime last summerand I made the huge mistake to stall it until this weekafter I finished Fuko's arch because I thought that there's nothing more to explore in this show.Little did I know :) I must sayI watched this anime with HUGE expectations:I expected everything from itand I was still overwhelmed by it.It made me laughit made me cry several timesit made my heart dance in my chestand by the end of each episode I was still singing the ending theme.It's pretty obvious that this is made after a visual novelbut I must sayit's the best thing they could have made out of it.Instead of making it an other harem animethey followed the evolution of the charactersalong with the little love story of Nagisa and Tomoya and when the curtains fell at the endI felt like saying goodbye to a friend,936,849,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I just watched this anime for the first time and I liked the story but the reason I didn't give it a higher mark is because in the middle it did get boring. The fuko storyline was very strong and very good it actually made me cry but the rest of the anime kind of went downhill. I think the last episode was good with the alternate ending but I don't understand alot of the hype because some parts of the story did annoy me like the fact that each character was steroetyped. Overall a nice and sweet anime but I wouldn't watch it beyong fuko.,937,850,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The Fuuko story line is in my opinion the only really good part about the story. In other anime the harem is at least hilarious and the main interest is at least 2 dimensional. In this case though the main girl is characterised by one word: weak. Not  puts on strong facade but is weak  or  is weak but mans up in times of need  just plain old weak.,938,851,2019-04-13 21:35:39

These three episodes are a welcome addition to the series.  They basically give a lot of insight into the past of characters that did not recieve much attention in the original. For examploe we learn the origin of Nice's burns and Jacuzzi's tattoo as well as Chane's background.  If you've seen the original you know what to expect in animation and sound and the story and characters flow in a similar fashion to the original series.  While these episodes add little to the existing storyline but are equally entertaining and serve to better flush out the show.,967,873,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This show more feels like it was made in 1986 instead of 1996. Everything about it screams 80's from their stylish hair to the constant random and i mean very random sex scenes. The show started off with a full on 5 minutes of sex....,971,877,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I own the first 3 seasons and this is one of my favorite anime from the 90's. I really enjoy the spectacular vocals from the English cast. That rightI'm saying it. It's just of the few that enjoy dubbed. Cowboy Bebop is the other. Anyway it's fully loaded with laughs and a great storyline. Check it out!!,974,880,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime follows up on the original Slayers series.,975,881,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Slayers is a series of western fantasy themed sword and sorcery mini novels by Hajime Kanzaka and among other things a series of anime based off the aforementioned novels. The series of Slayers follows a particularly gifted young sorceress named Lina Inverse as she and her various party members go about Slaying things.,976,882,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The ova isn't too bad... it seems to be more humorous than the first series but not as bad as Fumoffu... since it is a one off thing it didn't bother me as much as Fumoffu did.  If Fumoffu was only one or two episodes it wouldn't have been so bad.  Over all I like it.,978,884,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Spoiler Free Review,979,885,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I have to agree that Steel Angel Kurumi Zero was a very disappointing ending to the series. The main problem is that the usually cheerful Kurumi is suddenly made exceptionally angsty. She falls for a guy that's about to die. Saki is out of character as well as there is no lesbian tones with her. Karinka sheds her tsundere personality as well. She and Saki could be replaced with a cardboard cut-out much of the time and there would be no difference. ,980,886,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I loved the three before this and thats why I watched it expecting a bit of alternative stories where the plot didn't thicken but it might've given me another reason to love these steel angels. But it completely changed they didn't fight they were already awakened they were only high schoolers. I don't know I guess I was expecting a bit more. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone it really is only for diehard fans.,981,887,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Despite technically a well made movie there are some major issues in the storyline. The film changes tack halfway and decides not to care anymore about the killer disease that threatens humanity. Instead that part is only used to dispose of characters once they are not needed any longer. The second storyline is becoming increasingly far fetched despite some kind of wrap-up on the end. The movie meanders between overly gory details and its storyline making the gore rather gratuitous than essential. On the whole King of Thorn is a solid choice if there is nothing else around but certainly not a feature film.,992,898,2019-04-13 21:35:39
if i freeze my body and go in time i hope we get the Back To The Future - future but to the manga review well lets see this a virus name Medusa kills everybody in the world (wow i hope this is before i get kids) 7 people have to get out of a place ok real good now i really don't wanna say no more because it's a real good manga to read it's way to good they have a few plot holes that drive into your fuckin brain but it's solve at the end now about the Movie remy is my guest reviewer and he says  pretty cool  at first he said  confusin as hell  as his review but to me it was okay but the manga is way better,993,899,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Peeping Life is a very different and quite creative approach to anime. Each story is a recorded conversation between two people given a general topic and everything is improvised then the track is put to animation. It's fun to see what kind of thing people come up with off the top of their head and really is an honest look at wit and just fun. Unfortunatly it's quite dry and the animation is rather bad. You really have to take it at it's face: quick dry witted entertainment. Very much like evesdropping on a conversation.,994,900,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you're bored out of your mind want a good laugh and you love random things then you've come to the right place. The episodes are really short and if you combine them all together it essentially equates to the same length of a regular anime episode. Cheers and just enjoy complete randomness.,1002,908,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is not one to be taken seriously. It's sort of like daily lives as highschool boys in the sense that its completely random and i absolutely loved it. It was very funny to me and my only regret is that it wasnt longer. So if youre just looking for a good laugh then this is for you in my opinion.,1004,910,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story was very interesting for a slice of life I mean. This anime take a turn away from the normal slice of live by bring up the idea of tanks into it and in the end comes out quite origional. Unlike most slice of life animes with sports I have seen this one played out fine and they even lost a tank battle making it feel less like they win no matter what. Are main character on the otherhand is a bit shy in the start maybe a little too shy but away from the start feeling rushed the characters are ok but not that ferm loveable one that they could be.,1010,916,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime was a complete surprise for me. I watched an OVA thinking it was the first episode :P When I realised the mistake I got so into it I looked for the anime everywhere to watch it. ,1013,919,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story is expectional. Seeing school girls doing so called  Tankery  is just something that you do not see every day. I sure did like the animations and the tanks had realistic outlook. Sound gets 9 but i did expect bit louder sound effects for tank firing. Characters did have few secrets those will open up when you watch this enough. I like it.,1014,920,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ok first I'll admit this piece of review will be one of the most biased things you'll ever read because when you look into my profile you'll see that it's my 2nd top favorite anime. I usually try to be objective but really whenever I think about this anime I only see awesome in it but anyway here goes:,1016,922,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Girls und Panzer has a fantastic premise. Did the writing reinforce the potential of this premise? Unless you like to hear teenage girls talk about tank specs for half an hour at a time no it didn't.,1017,923,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm surprised this anime doesn't seem to have more fans. It's quite irreverant zany and a tad random but never annoying. Very bright and chirpy with excited characters things blowing up and of course moe. For me it's what I maight call  Breakfast Anime  one to watch while eating my cereal. Fantastical settings lots of comedy and a bit of ecchi make this a great anime in it's field.,1024,930,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story Plot : IT is mainly based on a girl (Naure) who lives with her Father. Naure is not your average teenage girl she is in Fact Half human half alien as her mother was a human and her father well an alien. Well this story mainly about Her life in planet Earth and how her Life was affected when she stumble upon a boy one day (Kazuto Iizuka) having met in an alley This story tells how Naure life changed after having met Kazuto. Many adventures awaits these two couples  but what can happen when your girlfriend is an allien?,1035,941,2019-04-13 21:35:39

With the spring season wrapped up I found myself in a kind of rut. Skipping through anime about vampires taking over the world and a girl in a slutty white dress rubbing all over some generic fantasy character I was wondering if any show would grab me and keep me watching. It took a long time but I finally at the very end of the spring list found that show.,1037,943,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was a lot better than I expected.  I'm a big fan of the  Yankee-kun to Megane-chan  drama (based on the manga by the same author as  Yamada-kun ) and they're both the same kind of anime about a  yankee  student and an honor student.  Some episodes were *really* confusing but I found that those kinds of details can be glossed over and still make this anime be fun to watch.,1038,944,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I agree with the guy who posted before me. this anime has almost 0 plot yet it is funny to watch.the characters are hilarious also the naming of said caracters are a no brainer as well. overall it's a good anime to watch if you just want laughs and eichi. also each episode is less then 5 min long,1051,957,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This story is really touching to all ages it has a tone about it that is easy to relate to. If you have two hours and some friends (or not that's cool too) you shouldn't be reading this review you should be watching that movie. This movie is super delightful!

A long-winded review for this show is unnecessary. ,1062,966,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Best Pokemon tv show I've ever seen I'm not really much of a fan of the anime and movies Pokemon has but this one was actually quite good. It's got a simple good contained storyline; nice fights good animation... in short: everything that would make Pokemon good! Although I was kind of disappointed to learn there were only 4 episodes.,1064,967,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This isn't a regular review of mine as this is a short 4 episode long television special and not an actual anime.,1065,968,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pokemon The Origin es lo que todo aficionado a los videojuegos de Pokemon deseo cuando fue anunciado cumplió el deseo de muchos aficionados de la franquicia alrededor del mundo. El poder ver por primera vez un anime que haga justicia a la franquicia como tal no me mal entiendan me gusta la serie de Pokemon con Ash  pero después de las primeras 4 temporadas la serie perdió todo su carisma y hoy en día solo entretiene a los niños y otakus empedernidos japoneses. Cumplió con sus expectativas pues si sin embargo pudo haber sido mucho mejor.,1066,969,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A big difference between Naruto and Dragon Ball Z is that DBZ Movies are good and with good villians (Broly Jameba Cooler),1078,979,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This story takes place 2 years after the war and it's quite different from what I was expecting as a fan. The main focus is still the story about the Sage of Six Paths and his older brother who had different thoughts and goals. Also Naruto and Hinata's love story  begins  here. Yes the knucklehead finally realizes Hinata's love for him and his own feelings for her which is extremely sweet. ,1079,980,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story take place after the ninja war and mainly focuses on the realtionship of naruto and hinata who has been captured by toneri for the purpose of marrying him. He is a new villain who is trying to destroy the earth with the power of the moon believing that this is the will of his ancestors in case the shinobi fight each other. ,1080,981,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ga-Rei Zero was a surprise I never heard of it it wasn't written about and touted as anything special. Iit is one of the best anime’s I have watched in a very long time even among those I think are great this stands out. From the very first episode I was shocked and gripped I couldn't stop watching. The animation is very good high quality in fact no distractions here not sloppy at all. This is no unnecessarily happy rejoiceful anime nor is it wrist slitting depressing like some. It is honest to the bone. This is what really pulled me in the plot and the manner in which the story is told. They were surprising and refreshing. I'm a big fan of main stream popular anime like Bleach and Naruto but if you want something different more realistic this show really stands out. The beginning and the end were really stand outs and the middle explains and sets everything up. It's a well balanced story that is just ambiguous enough to make you curious what else is going on outside of the main story and what will happen next. I'm purposely vague even this I feel may reveal too much. My only real critique is that it's only 12 episodes long but it's high quality and very satisfying.,1095,996,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story,1096,997,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'm going to buy this anime when it comes out on DVD. It plays out almost like a classic Greek tragedy delivering one hell of a compelling story. The unique style of foreshadowing set the tone for this show that kept me wondering as I watched. And the relationships carried the story. Really solid character work going on here. Definitely one of the best supernatural dramas I've seen in a while.,1097,998,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 I was peacefully reading Ga-Rei manga and just finished Yomi Arc. But the story of Kagura-Yomi past was barely explained in very weak not engaging way. So since I remembered hearing something about prequel to manga I thought -  Ah what the hell... let's stall manga for a while and watch the prequel I mean come one it can't get worse than this average manga right ?,1098,999,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Mediocre. The first episode was OK although you should not use CGI when you cant make a good one. The action is pretty boring. Either the good guys kill everyone easily or the bad guys do the same. Pretty lazy stuff if you ask me. Seconds episode. All the same and then they cut and go back to the past. That was the point I was already considering to drop this. Few more minutes and I made up my minds. This just isnt good enough. Its not bad but I would only watch it if I had absolutely nothing else to do. The whole thing is cliche(watch 1-2 episodes and you will feel like on a class of how to make anime 1.01. It has everything that we can usually finds but it doesnt give anything extra. Watchable but only good to kill time.,1099,1000,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"Having recently finished watching Ga-Rei Zero I was left in two minds in whether this was a success or failure.Ga-Rei Zero for the most part is a solidly written and executed anime the characters are believable and the relationship between the two main characters Yomi and Kagura is well directed. The problem with Ga-Rei Zero stems from the fact that it is just too short having only twelve episodes your left with the feeling more episodes would of benefited the production allowing it more time to develop the storyline and give it more foundation to grow instead your left with what could be a fantastic story being rushed and fitted into twelve episodes.

It starts out pretty good first few episodes show us the ropes they introduce the main characters. After about 5 episodes the series get really boring they just run out of gas barely anything interesting happens. In this part the intellect of the main character is basically put to a side which is a mistake. ,1111,12,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This show is about a high school student named Yakumo who has the ability to see spirits with his left red eye and sometimes communicate with them(not a super original premise but highly entertaining nontheless). He spends his spare time tricking kids out of their money with fake card tricks or just sleeping about. But once in a while he'll take a spirit associated police case that has piqued his interest. But with his troubled family past and issues with humanity will Yakumo ever be able to live a normal life?,1116,16,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I heard about this anime from an AMV I watched and the first two episodes were really cute. Then the third episode got a little strange but I continued watching anyway. It was worth it. I'm in tears as I just finished the last episode. If you like deep psycgologal stories this is for you. It has deep meaning and it's beautiful.,1120,20,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I am rather careful about giving an anime a  perfect 10  but this one did it for me. The story is gripping and deep. It mixes elements of the slice-of-life genre with drama action suspense post-apocolyptic seinen shoujo and fantasy in a perfect blend. What comes out is a rollercoaster ride that is unforgettable and yet bitterly short. This could have easily been a 13 or 26 episode series but one could argue that its current presentation is devoid of filler. You're doing yourself a disservice by not watching this.,1128,27,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime was a very pleasant surprise for me. Befor i watch something I usually check the recommendations. Here they are completely off. Black Butler is not similar to this. Gosick has more action in the into song than Hyouka in 5 episodes. If you want to compare it to something compare it to either Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood(animation story setting) or Sword Art Online (the main characters and a lot of the plot - find each other).,1157,54,2019-04-13 21:35:39

GOSICK takes place in 1924 in a small made-up European country of Sauville. The story centers on Kazuya Kujo the third son of a Japanese Imperial soldier who is a transfer student to St. Marguerite Academy where urban legends and horror stories are all the rage. There he meets Victorique a mysterious yet beautiful and brilliant girl who never comes to class and spends her days reading the entire content of the library or solving mysteries that even detectives can't solve. The series mostly focuses on Kazuya and Victorique getting involved in different mystery cases and their struggle to solve them at the same time forming important bonds with different people.,1160,57,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime's STORY was beautifully constructed.  I have to admit that the first few episodes bored me.  However once we hit the middle of the series and we entered into the Gray Wolf's village the true plotline began and I was hooked.  I thought that all of the subtle references to the second World War was fascinating and including a real war in an imaginary time was extremely interesting for me.,1162,59,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story(10/10),1169,66,2019-04-13 21:35:39
After listening to my brothers gushing for three days straight I decided to finally give it a go. To be honest the first few episodes started off a little off for me. I just wasn’t feeling it. Or more importantly I didn’t feel as engrossed as I needed to be to continue with the series. But by episode five things finally started to pick up. From there on for a while things went pretty smoothly and I found myself breezing through the episodes but not before long I would be a step back when again I felt like the series was starting to lose my interest. The last few episodes were great but did I love it like I had hoped? Definitely not. In the end it was the secondary characters that I took away something from rather than our protagonists.  Maybe I’ll review it in more detail a little later on but right now I’m just not feeling all that inspired. ,1170,67,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The biggest mystery: why don't any bubbles come out of Victorique's pipe?  I would appreciate it if someone could line up the fragments of chaos that answer that question.,1171,68,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1172,69,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Detective stories never go out of fashion but finding a way to make them interesting is another matter entirely. Some leave things open to interpretation whilst others rely on convoluted mysteries that are more difficult to follow than a city street map. There are also whole bodies of work dedicated to the exploits of well known sleuths like Sherlock Holmes Hercule Poirot Miss Marple Inspector Morse and more.,1174,70,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One of the most endearing qualities of Gosick is its solid plot. While at first it seems to be somewhat episodic one quickly finds that the conflicts and mysteries of each episode are inextricably linked and all point to a grander scheme. This show is easy to continue watching all the way through; rather than being easy to watch it's difficult not to watch. Also unlike many animes it doesn't leave one with a dissatisfied feeling resulting from an unresolved conflict or love triangle. None of that here.,1175,71,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Gosick is a pretty cool show. Anyone who has a weakness for Sherlock Holmes styled plots early twentieth century European settings a mix of myth and logic clashing together and a solid (if at times silly) plot should have a blast. There is no excessive fan service or cheap tricks but it rather focuses on the characters solving crimes.,1176,72,2019-04-13 21:35:39

For all of you reading this wondering how you can watch it as well I have some bad news - this movie is a short film shown only at the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka Japan.

I watched this anime because I read a review that sparked my interest in it. And even though it's rated quite poorly I must say that it isn't a bad watch. ,1189,85,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Okay I am going to make this review short (kind of). This anime sucked balls (litterally). I am not a fan of this type of genre (the forbidden love kind/incest).,1190,86,2019-04-13 21:35:39
You know I see how bad the stars are for this one and I can't help but say that those aren't really true to how this show should be rated. Yeah the only reason I watched this was because I was desperate for anime's but after I did I was actually really glad I watched it. It was funny and weird a bit on the sexual side but to be hoenst it didn't bother me like I thought it would. I ususally hate ecchi anime's but for some reason this show interested me enough to at least try it and sure enough I was laughing at how ridiculously misunderstood the main character becomes to the people around her. I'm a female and I liked this show so I'm sure once you get passed all the crazy stuff you will also find yourself loving all the weirdness about it. ,1191,87,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I understand why so many people are upset with 'Soul Eater Not!  one thing is the vastly different art style the new characters and the fact that it's a slice of life anime I loved it myself. I thought that all of the characters were great even the new ones I liked that it gave more background on established characters and the Soul Eater Universe and I think it was great as a slice of life/world building anime Soul Eater Not! was a good idea by Soul Eaters creator because it gave a way to introduce things to the readers/viewers that the characters in the orginal Soul Eater would have already know this is my first Slice of Life anime and I think it was great. So many people compare this to Soul Eater yes this was the follow up and yes it doesn't have as much action but thats not the purpose its to give people more information on the background behind the world of Sould Eater which couldn't be done in the first series as it wouldn't make sense. From what I've seen its polarizing if you love it you love it you hate it you hate no changing either side and no one in the middle so many people wanted another action packed Soul Eater with the same characters and I know why I just think Not! is just as good as the orginal.,1199,94,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Don't be fooled by the  Soul Eater Not  title. If you seriously take the time to watch this you will regret having wasted your time watching this terrible execuse at a prequel. Soul Eater Not fails to live up to it's big brother  Soul Eater  mainly because the dark feeling just insn't there and we barley see the main characters from the original. Now I will admit that the animation is great and the three main characters and only the three main characters are great to get to know. The music is decent and the story is average. REALLY JUST PAY THIS ANIME NO MIND AT ALL. ,1200,95,2019-04-13 21:35:39

How could they make soul eater into a girly slice-of-life with crappy fanservice... Why... Why did you do this?,1205,99,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I have difficulty putting into words my utter disappointment in this show.  I watched Soul Eater years ago and really loved it.  When I heard that Soul Eater Not! was coming out I was not expecting good results.  I even had a friend of mine warn me not to expect Soul Eater when watching this show.  Even then I was still disappointed.  ,1206,100,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Nothing special though I didn't hate it as much as most just for the nostalgia of it all.  The characters were pretty lame.  It was a strange story for a prequel.  It was more of a spinoff- it definately shouldn't have tried to compete with the story that would come next in Soul Eater.  It was just a fluffy little girls story that tried to zero in more on what it was probably like for maka and the gang when they first began DMWA- basically zeroing in on a group of students and making it into a coming of age high school shoujo.  The results were not fantastic.  I'm sure anyone who watched was hoping for just a little of the old stuff and this didn't really deliver.  Of course they tell you it's NOT soul eater ok. If they had zeroed in on something psychological like what it means to become a weapon or being a good witch it would have soared.  They always seem to touch on gold mines in 12 episode series' but gloss over it to hurry up and set the scene for an actioney ending.  I didn't enjoy the constant feeling that all the girls were going to start making out at any moment or that there were no male characters to speak of.  And man the last episode was so gay it had me cringing from the dialouge to the ridiculousness of two girls flying through the air trying to share one weapon and defeat a witch with the power of friendship.  ,1207,101,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This story takes the spirit of seperation to a new extreme.  I have yet to watch it and NOT shed a tear.  Hoplessness and longing for contact is something a lot of people have never experienced.  For them this title will most likely be boring.  For anyone who has experienced long term seperation from the one you love most it is heart breaking.  Lovers watch and hold one another.  Jaded persons need not apply. So far far away but just as close as my heart.,1209,103,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The animation itself in this is really a let down it almost blinded me. BUT that is to be expected since it was made by one person. If you can get past that though the plot idea is interesting and believable. The idea of communication over long distances taking longer and longer was sad as you saw the male lead growing older and the heroine barely aging. This movie got to me on a personal level and is a bit ofa  downer in some ways. Overall what's good; plot is straightforward characters are good. Bad; animation sucks bad and the sound isn't much better.,1214,107,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story was interesting and very moving. It is unfortunate that it was bogged down but such low quality animation. There was no consistency in any of it and it looked like a beginner animator did all the work. it pales in comparison to this animation company's other works such as Garden of Words. If there is any sort of reason to watch this short it would be for the unique story and excellent soundtrack (the voice acting was also pretty good).,1221,114,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Made by one man; a mad man at that. Only one like that could make a masterpiece like this. A masterpiece might be too bold a term but it is one man. One who created a tragic tale of separated lovers; separated by time and space. I admit I wept a few times once during the scene where Mikako messaged Noboru that it would take eight years for the next message to arrive and again later on. Some other sad stuff occurs and the waiting definitely tugged at the heart strings. But we don't know much about the two apart from their situation but for me that was all I needed. Considering that it's only a half hour I guess there wasn't much that could be done.,1228,121,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Can a show with pretty solid world setting likeable characters good action pace and good animation turn out to be mediocre? Index proves that indeed it can.  And this fact really makes me a sad panda. Why? Well Index got 2 really amazing ideas for character powers - ability of an alchemist and ability of certain esper called Accelarator. I won't spoil you the content but if you watch this show you will understand the unbelievable potential of those 2 powers. And even with that the show fails to deliver. Let's check why...,1237,129,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sigh.. started off some what good. Middle sucked horriblynd was quite boring. The white haired kid was the only interesting thing withhis show. His arc was probably the best and the whole show ends with a prettyig open ending…  hopefully the Falleason of 2009 will answer some of the questions at the end of this. Reallyon’t understand why this was about Index to begin with most of the show ateast 2/3’s of it was about Misaki the railgun girl.,1249,140,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Whether or not you'll like this series is debatable. I personally love it but after reading a couple of other reviews I heard some logical reasons why this show may not be for you so I decided to edit the score a bit from my initial thought from a logical standpoint making this review more accurate(hopefully).,1252,143,2019-04-13 21:35:39

An older anime with outdated art but don't let that stop you from watching this very good anime. This one I would title as a comfort anime it just makes you happy to watch and hard not to love. Those who grew up on cartoons during the 90's early 2000's will be more used to the art style and this factor contributes to that comfort.,1256,147,2019-04-13 21:35:39

My favorite anime/manga of all time. I found it to be the perfect combo of Inu-Yasha action and Urusei Yatsura comedy. Best of both worlds in more ways than one. What makes Ranma 1/2 is the characters and their kooky flaws. It is bascially the anime equilvanet of looney tunes from the slapstick to the well thought out jokes (even if repeteiveitve) jokes. Its timeless and can be started at any point no mattter the situation. You'll find yourself laughing one way or another because it is a chracter driven comedy with some of the best jokes and laughs you'll have watching anime. It's a martial arts animal gender bender romantic coemdy. Highly reccomend it especially if your a Rumiko fan! It's about a 16 year old martial artist who goes to China and falls in one of the cursed Jusenkyo springs and now turns into a girl when splashed with cold water and back to a boy when splashed with warm water. During his teenage dilemma his father sets him up to marry one of his good friends Soun Tendo's three daughters. The one chosen happens to be the only one who says she despises men. Now they will have to deal with suitors from both sexes and more Jusenkyo spring victoms in order for their enagament to last. There is very little chracter development expect for the main three most enjoyable chracters Ranma Akane and Ryouga.,1259,150,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is mainly held together by the comedy for me. Its got it's cute romantic moments and key points. But aside from the main theme being fighting the comedy is just astounding. There are parts where you just have to laugh because some of the things said or done is just so silly. The characters are whacky and unique and the anime is very clever. For a harem it really wasn't all that bad compared to others I've seen. The main love interests weren't fickle and it was clear who Ranma and Akane loved despite everyone elses' advances. This anime is a real mood lifter for those who've had a bad day.,1260,151,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Let me start off right away by saying; no I haven't read the manga. Although I had heard about Ranma 1/2 before it was only since very recently that I came in contact with it. And it just so happens that I prefer watching anime than reading manga.,1261,152,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ranma is a truly amazing manga one of my favourites one of the best. Funny as sin and quite a good story too with some nifty action scenes. I love it.,1262,153,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Go ahead call me a reactionary after seeing all of the below (even though I'm pro gun control pro-environment pro-Palestine and anti-censorship) but given the illusion of knowledge I've learnt that people don't make judgements based on reason just self interest so you shouldn't care much what they think.,1266,157,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I've watched this anime twice and it still is as awesome as I saw it when I was a kid.,1267,158,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is the show that got me to watch anime.  I loved zatch when I was younger and it was on Cartoon Network.  The animation wasnt great but served its purpose and was humorous as well!  The plot was a tried and true contest-form but was interesting in its own way.  The characters are what made the show however.  With so many mamodo running around there were so many varied personalities to relate to that I am willing to bet there is at least one character in this show that anyone can relate to or like.  Personally I love zatch's attitude and Kiyo's strategy.  While it may not be the best series I have seen or my favorite there will always be a special place in my heart for zatch.,1268,159,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As a young misguided teen I went through a phase of anime interest which lasted my final school years when I would purchase renowned Manga's that were genuinely well made films - the likes of Akira Ninja Scroll and Spirited Away still take pride of place on my shelf. However during those foolish days I came across Manga 'The Collection' - a bunch of films short and long (and series) supposedly worthy of being re-released and dubbed in English. The majority of which are rubbish. I know this from experience as I was gifted a 'collection' dvd in the form of Violence Jack which has various brief trailers for the others in the collection (most of which had intense music from Japanese techno-rock group The Mad Capsule Markets a clever ploy indeed). If only I had the foresight to be content with the trailer of 'Vampire Wars' as it is a far greater piece of work than the actual title..,1273,164,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Personally I love anime's that are only 1-3 episodes long sometimes even if they are short they get the story across and its still good. That is not the case for this particular show. Its boring long and a waste of time. There was plenty of gore/blood throughout it which is something I love but in this show it seemed pointless there was no reason for it at all. Plus there were a few sex scenes (if you can even call them that) which were also pointless in my opinion. The animation for an older show is actually pretty good which was somewhat of a relief while watching this. The story if you can even call it that made no sense and when it ended you didn't understand anything that had happened. Basically there is no real story line here and I felt it was a waste of time. If you haven't seen it yet I don't suggest watching it.,1274,165,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is by far the most obscure anime I've ever seen. It manages to be far more obscure than even Sorette Dakara Ne. This anime is basically advice about brushing your teeth for children then pregnant women and then old people. ,1275,166,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1276,167,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you are looking for anime with great action scenes excellent choreographed fights then you’ve come to the right place. Even if you’re not into mecha’s I highly recommend no I insist that you check this anime out. You will not be disappointed.,1277,168,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This show is really funny. Sadly I can't really find the Japanese version of the show and ended up watching it in Cantonese (which I luckily understand because the subtitles are in Chinese too.) It's kind of old but don't let that prevent you from watching the show. The situations the characters are in and the really funny episodes will definitely keep you watching it. ,1283,173,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ah the long awaited sequel to Toaru Majutsu no Index finally came and it was well received. For fans of the first season- you are in for a great ride... ending with the promise of a sequel (well if they don't have one I may have to commit seppuku because they set it up for one soooooo well). Some of the main complaints about the first season-  Oh they just go from one girl to the next never really progressing the story line   they just ignore so many awesome characters  etc. - are fairly well adressed. Anyways on to the actual review....,1286,176,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I am posting this general review across :,1287,177,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Okay i am going to be straightforward and say this isnt really a review.  I wanna let people know out there that dont know yet that this series is based on the light novels  To Aru Majutsu noIndex  which is still going and going real strong as 10 of top 10 novels of all time i believe. This series is not noticed enough which i can understand why since no one probably knew of the novels. ,1288,178,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Since no one wants to do a review of this anime guess I'll bite the bullet & do it. Here's the breakdown:,1293,182,2019-04-13 21:35:39
How did I fall upon one of the most unique anime out there?  I guess you can say I got really bored and didn't know what to watch when the Summer 2015 season rolled around.  I stumbled upon Prison School and put that on my  Want to Watch  list hoping for a decent laugh.,1295,183,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is a highly stylized filthy and unapologetic one. Highlighting not only a sense of realism in the world of fetish but doing so with a sense of humor. ,1296,184,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is pretty messed up and yet I marked the date of the next episode like many other less messed up animes airing this season. Despite it's obvious turn offs and all or perhaps because of these it catched my interest. ,1297,185,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,1299,187,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Everyone now and then I cannot fully review a show because it has a very narrow appeal. Prison School is one of those shows.,1300,188,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Not much to say about this anime it's simply amazing only a bit to much ecchi and weird scenes but all the comedy makes it good. Story in unique and amazing really hoping for a second season which i know will come. The animation and the faces the characters make in some of the situations is just amazing only this was enough for me to laugh my ass off. Adré gakuto and the chairman they are just hilarious. I really recommend it for people who like comedy and ecchi but for people who don't like weird cartoony scenes i recommend you to still watch it. ,1301,189,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Storyline... trying to live normal highschool lives and try not to get expelled while being targeted by girls who dont want men at their school. Events and circumstances around each makes for a hilarious and semi-perverted entertainment. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.,1302,190,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Mediocre first film in the Pokemon franchise. i saw this in a theater when it came out and remeber being underwelmed even then. I dont know what to tell about it as the plot to clone Pokemon would be stale even for the TV show. And the message of fighting not solving anything fells forced after watching monsters fight the crap out of each other for at least 30 minutes rings hollow.,1325,199,2019-04-13 21:35:39

One of the best OVA series I've ever seen. I've seen the original Harlock so I was excited to see how the characters looked totally updated and modernized. It was awesome. The characters looked just like how they used to back in the 70's but now they are animated better better coloring etc. The voice acting has improved a lot too. I still preferred Dr. Zero's original voice. Captain Harlock / Herlock was just as BA. I especially liked Mimeh's seiyuu. I don't know why but I just wished she had more lines in the show.,1329,202,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is great for you if you like crude comedy (rudeunappropiate). Do not let the cover for this anime fool you yes the poster looks like it might turn out to be a childish anime however it is the complete oppoiste. Yondemasuyo is extremly funny from the first to the last episode.,1336,207,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series combines slapstic comedy with gallows humor to a mostly pleasing result. The show is more of a sitcom with no overarching story per se. I found the majority of the epidodes amusing. ,1337,208,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Okay so from what I remember from the show basically its about sex slaves and this one dude trying to escape? I can't remember it's been a while since I've watched. All I really remember is majestic hair of the blonde guy!,1338,209,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'm still not sure  if after this show kids will hate those vggies more or will it turn out the other way ( which is almost imposible) that kids will say   Oh I want broccolies  :D,1339,210,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Anime naprawde bardzo dobre! Polecam wszystkim którzy pragną choć na chwile zapomnieć o wszystkim innym i pośmiać się bowiem przy oglądaniu Tego Anime nie widze innej opcji jak nie kontrolowany wybuch śmiechu co jakiś czas. Jednak by efekt był jeszcze lepszy polecam oglądać ten tytłół z Przyjaciółką/Przyjacielem bo wtedy radocha jest dwa razy silniejsza.  He is My Master  to tytuł naprawde godny uwagi nie zauważyłem w nim wielu błędów czy niedociągnięć oczywiście każdy woli co innego i nie każdemu spodoba się ten tytuł nie mniej jednak zachęcam każdego do obejrzenia tego (niestety) krótkiego Anime. Anime ma tylko 12 odc. i jest pełne śmiechu wierzcie mi jeszcze chyba na żadnym innym Anime tak się nie śmiałem.,1347,218,2019-04-13 21:35:39

when i found out about this series i was like.... 'woohooo !!!' i had found something i was exactly looking for and for the first time ever!! ....Beck is a series dedicated to rock music though they couldn't put up much effort to make a blast off it.... on the other hand it leans mostly towards the plot which isquite a decent drama... a regular kid who gets slowly pushed towards liking music and so he picks up a guitar to find his place on a music band.... The strongest part about BECK is the characters and their interactions to the surroundings it's been handled beautifully... not too much comedy nor too serious.... just warm decent goofy and cheesey people :D About the animation.... well theirs nothing much of an eyesore in this part not at all fluid :( just try overlooking it and i bet you'll enjoy... lastly wanna say... don't expect too much out of the series neither do you have to take it as for a bullshit xD... just hope for something moderate and you'll get the best out of it ;),1350,221,2019-04-13 21:35:39
ALL I REALLY WANT TO SAY IS I WISH THE ENDING WOULD HAVE BEEN A SECOND SEASON RATHER THAN A MASH UP!,1351,222,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,1352,223,2019-04-13 21:35:39
before i kick off this review i should probable note that i have not seen most of the episodes.  but i have read all of the manga.  the manga was incredible but the anime defiantly didn't compare to it at all.  first off in the story Koyuki has some kind of amazing voice which you can believe in the manga cause theres nothing to prove otherwise but in the anime (especially the japanese version) you can tell there's nothing special about his voice.  also they replaced Beatle covers they did (more so in the english version) with other songs so as a music fan i was really disappointed.,1353,224,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,1355,225,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1356,226,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you have just now discovered this show i feel you're pain.  A pain of missing out on one of the best music orientated series ever.   I mean if there is to be a show about music then the music must phenomenal.  The story must be unique and the characters better be interesting.  Well dear reader i am hear to tell you this is worth every bit of your time.  So please make room in you're busy schedule and enjoy the Mongolian Chop Squad.,1357,227,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Beck. Totally glad I got around to watching this anime. Oddly I come from a past heavily involved in music yet somehow I never stuck Beck on my watchlist. Having recently watched Nana however changed my priorities list. Thankfully.,1359,229,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't know if it is just me but after the end an anime that I really became engrossed in ends I am left with a feeling of a sort of emptiness. I got this feeling after this anime.,1360,230,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Myself i watched Beck as a teenager this anime is my absolute favorite anime and i will tell you why. Beck is about a 14 year old boy that discovers music from the angle of rock. It's a classic anime in a more modern envoirment and shows us how people around you can react based on the choices you make in life and how much time you put into your own interests.,1361,231,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This will always be one of my favorite shows ever. If you enjoy BL you should definitely consider watching it! The art is absolutely fantastic and characters were wonderful.,1372,242,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Love love love love love this anime! So KAWIAA ! I was first reading the manga but then turned to the anime because I couldn't wait for updates but both are great! LOVE this anime !,1373,243,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The character designs were my favorite part of this anime. Admittedly the story here is weaker than in the manga (which was the first manga I read all the way through--so far). So a lot of the more potent and emotional moments are left out of this adaptation.,1374,244,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I only give the story a 9 because it is watered down from the manga which annoyed me. It went from mature audience manga to pg 13ish anime. Still it was an adorable BL story. This is ironically my first BL anime ever. I loved it because it was adorable sweet and addictive. The second it started I wanted those two to fall in love and find everlasting happiness. I loved the music; the ending song was so catchy I listen to it on youtube all the time lol. I was not a fan of the ending mostly because it cuts off before the really dramatic stuff happens but other than watering down the sexual content from the manga (which it's still good even without) it kept pretty in tune with the manga which always makes me happy I hate deviation. The art was cutesy and fit the story. If this were a book rather than a manga it is exactly how I would picture the characters looking. As I said I hadn't seen nor read any other BL stuff before this so I can't say if it's to typical or stereotyping  but I found it adorable and endearing and have decided to look into the genre more. If you don’t like BL don’t watch obviously I hope people that don’t like BL are smart enough to not need the warning but I figure I should put it out there just in case. If you do like BL and you like seeing adorable couples come together watch this.,1375,245,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ahh my first adventure into BL and what a lovely little journey it was. I was admittedly a shoujo buff who intially wrote off shounen-ai as 'male-centric shoujo with sex' and I was very very wrong. Love Stage!! is an enjoyable ride through the romantic struggles of our leads lovingly ripped straight out of the first arc of the manga minus the uh slightly more naughty parts.,1376,246,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Shounen-ai anime can be hard to rate because they aren't for everyone. If you dislike male male romance comedies...this won't make a good watch for you. But for those who DO like shounen-ai and know what they're getting into this may be a treat.,1378,248,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Primeiro ando muito apaixonada por yaoi e meus olhinhos brilharam quando eu soube desse anime. Quando o conheci ele ainda estava em andamento então esqueci de acompanhar. Só fui lembrar dele quando vi em uma página no facebook. Para minha alegria ele tinha acabado de concluir. No começo eu achei o Izumi afeminado demais mas isso não atrapalhou minha animação em ver. Gostei bastante do tema e do enredo e me apaixonei pelas peculiaridades de cada personagem principalmente o Shogo irmão do Izumi. Além de lindo ele é super protetor e trata o irmãozinho como uma coisa fofa preciosa. Eu me apaixonei também pelo Ryouma. Lembro que muita gente reclamou que ele não era um seme perfeito que era isso e aquilo e tals. Mas ele me encantou bastante porque sempre estava atrás do Izumi e ajudava-o no que fosse preciso. Eu simplesmente amei o Rei. Ele era praticamente a mãe e pai do Izumi e ele era super engraçado apesar de rígido. Gostei bastante do desfecho da história. Se eu pudesse mudar algo ou rescrevesse a estória eu deixaria exatamente como está porque ela foi perfeita em todos os sentidos. Amei muito mesmo. Espero realmente que saia algumas ovas pra gente e quem sabe uma segunda temporada. Nota 1000000…. Super recomendo para quem gosta de yaoi fofo e engraçado romance tudo na medida.,1379,249,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First anime movie I'd been looking forward to watching in a while Ghibli's The Wind Rises! reviewing this off my first time watching it i usually change my mind (as you do) on ceratain things (for me things and songs tend to grow on me :P ),1383,253,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Allright. It's been a while since I've done something like this so bear with me as I try to find my way again.I did quite a lot of them in the past on a different website which you can find here: http://legendsofsatura.net/index.php/forum125/6-reviewing-guild.html,1384,254,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One of the greatest movies I've ever seen and a stunning final piece of work from Studio Ghibli. Buy it on BluRay keep it as a timeless classic that it is destined to be. I highly enjoyed this beautiful masterpiece and am almost positive that anyone else who is a fan of Ghibli movies will. ,1385,255,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Intro...,1387,257,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"The plot is hard to understand until you have seen the flashbacks  the characters are interesting . There is some romance but its not defined and it never shows if there trully are one sided . I felt that the story was rushed but at the same time  it took forever for the main fight. the songs in my part i enjoyed them very much . And there is a good amount of exciting and well placed fights  i felt that the main hero of the story needed a little bit more power and he was a little bit on the lay back side of the word. As for the heroine too high strung and too stubborn even for her own good. This feels like the type of anime to watch were you are bored to death and need something to pass the time.

How did I slog through this snoozefest.  I still don't know.  Nostalgia I guess.  I basically just registered to say I loved loved loved old school Tenchi and this show was terrible terrible terrible.  Just absolutely terrible.  AIC ought to be ashamed of themselves for making this.,1390,260,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"(My opinion everyone) ",1393,263,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Incredibly mediocre for a series that seems quite popular always mentioned when someone asks for a good romance to watch.  The story was perhaps the least interesting of any anime I've seen.  Absolutely nothing happened.  Every episode was a minisode filler dull.  Nothing amounted to anything save for one of course which was the worst part to watch.  It is essentially a story of a guy forcing himself on a girl who eventually caves.  There is no develpment whatever from Misaki.  Her secret is never revealed she never wraps things up with the love triangle and she never overcomes her hatred/fear of men before she gives herself to Usui.  I expected her to at least overcome her humiliation of being a maid in 26 episodes and tell her secret.  I suppose that's what has made me so angry how little managed to happen and develop in such a long series.  In an anime less than 20 episodes I would be gracious and assume that it simply caught up the manga and had to tie up loose ends on it's own in a hurry but I can't make excuses for this one.  I did not even enjoy the romance.  It was awkward the way Usui kept touching and harassing her and forcing himself on her and the actual moments of real romance were cheesy and put in specifically to evoke spastic fangirling at how hot Usui was.  It was cheap romance and did not touch me in the least.  Nothing good here at all in the end Misaki is a strong female character and it's the only thing worth mentioning.  ,1394,264,2019-04-13 21:35:39
  Let's just say I'm not a big fan of romcoms but one of my friend insisted for me to watch this. And I got bored over summer so I did.,1395,265,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Let me start out by saying I ADORE Kaichou wa Maid-sama. It easily ranks in my top 5 shoujo anime of all time probably top 3. That being said I do believe it's possible to like - even LOVE! - something and still admit that it has flaws.,1405,275,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I absolutely loved this anime thank goodness it was recommended to me by this website I binged watched all 27 episodes in one day and found them to be very entertaining. This anime will make you laugh for sure! The anime's characters are amazing and the story plot was fun as well. I highly recommend it!,1408,278,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The journey of Misaki and Usui is a turmoil filled but very entertaining one.its great to watch as theses two characters who at first know very little of each other get to know one another. The two central characters have very similar but also very unique personalities and it's both frustrating and enthralling to watch. As Misaki balances her school and student leader role as well as her job at a maid cafe she struggles to keep her two lives separate when Usui stumbles upon her secret. This anime is hilarious and the minor characters within the series are so amazingly weird  you can't help but love it.,1409,279,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is like the top shojou anime EVER! in my op ;),1410,280,2019-04-13 21:35:39

What to say about this show other than amzaing. Usually i tell whether i'll enjoy an anime based on it's music score (I don't just judge it on the music but you can tell how much care was put into bringing this show off the page and onto the screen). An amzing score that fits well with the characters moods and story moments. The animation was very good though at some points i did think it could have been improved but thats just me and they were so minute i doesn't really matter anyway. At first i was iffy on the show becasue i couldn;'t decide if i liked the concept i mean really cliche BUT it turned out to be a unique spin and was really moving as was the refreshing doses of comefy throughout.,1413,283,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ok so this is the review for the average teenage girl whos out there looking for anime. Kaichou wa Maid-sama simply put is a great romantic comedy that will leave you smiling! Complete with a happy ending and a relationship that warms your heart this anime will have you in tears laughing so hard and has one of the best romance scenes comparable to that of Toradora's last episode (although this anime's ending is much more complete and well happy.) The characters in this anime are priceless just priceless I have grown to fall in love with all of them. I am hoping as I'm sure you will be for another season!,1421,291,2019-04-13 21:35:39

this is personally my favorite romance anime. I know the score should be a 10 since it's my favorite and I'm going to tell you the reason why it's not I really hated when Misaki's childhood friend just like shows up out of nowhere. I thought the plot was progressing fine and her childhood friend did nothing to advance their relationship I mean Usui got jealous for about five seconds and then it was over. Her friend just showed up randomly over the last like 5 episodes and started eating some random crap he found or started picking fights with Usui. Other than that this anime is pretty good in my opinion and I think that it will be enjoyable for anyone if they give it a chance.,1426,296,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is definitely one of my favourites. It has such a cute storyline and the characters are very lovable. I especially love Usui as he is what guys should be like today! The two characters have such a cute chemistry between each other and pretty much everyone will enjoy this anime.,1429,299,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is a good romance anime it centers around a more hostile and oblivious female lead. If you are planning on watching it I would suggest subbed. Only one thing really got on my nerves is that the dubbed version makes the main character to be overly aggressive and loses alot in the translation.,1431,301,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I highly recommend this anime. So perfect! Like Usui! :D <3 The story is really good. The characters are good. One of my fave couple. I never been addicted to read manga 0r to watch anime before but after i read & watch it. It change my life!.,1432,302,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This movie was a starting point into the World of X for me. I neverctually enjoyed it but I was intrigued enough to go on and watch themmensely more satisfying series a short time after. I don't know ifhat the movie aims to achieve is to get people interested in the storynd go on to read the manga (a device employed by many franchisesncluding Fake) or to convince an anime company that they had enoughaterial for a series; but on that front it works well.,1437,307,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Stunning animation beautiful artwork good character designs and a perfect atmosphere can only do so much to cover the fact that there is no plot no plot at all. The current trend in our modern media today is to try to say as much as possible with as little as possible and this a perfect example of where this crosses the line. People can try to make up their own observations of what this anime is truly attempting to convey but in the end the author really exerted no effort relaying very much at all. That being said this really is a remarkable feat in animation and design but when compared to works like Eve no Jikan with both stunning animation and profound episodes I can't help but feel Pale Cacoon is merely eye candy.,1440,310,2019-04-13 21:35:39

some times somethings are not realy deep but when you look at them from another perspective you will see the real aspect of it. And that what is  Pale Cocoon  you need too look at it from many perspetive to see the thru face of it,1450,317,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The main story seems to be a classic; humanity's irresponsible actions (enviromentally-wise in this case) bring an end to the world as we know it. In the future people are trying to recover archives of the past world although this way they are forced to come face to face with humanity's mistakes and fate. An attempt to be atmospheric almost succeeds yet there is too little information given and at times it seems that the artists didn't even look at what they were drawing. It is dissapointing that even though the idea is great the anime itself is a waste of time.,1451,318,2019-04-13 21:35:39

i really enjoyed the first season and was over joyed to hear about the second.... i do have to admit that the second season wasnt as good as the first bu was a good follow up ^^,1458,325,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was amazed on how much i got captivated by this series. they did a great job with the whole story line and the character line up. with the mix of perverted comady action and tender moments i could not get enough. i do hope they make a 3rd season.,1459,326,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sekirei ~Pure Engagement~ was very surprising not only was it a lot better than the first series but I believe that Sekirei ~Pure Engagement~ brought the show to a whole new level. The action was more exciting and fast paced the comedy was funnier and laughs out loud material and the story was told much more precise way and in more depth.,1460,327,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I've got nothing profound to say about the direction or animation or characters that made me like this show so much. For some ineffable reason I found the characters likeable and the plot to be just monotonous enough to be likened with my own. It took power over me with charming characters and daily events and arguments that you may have with your own friends. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an everyday anime,1470,333,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"What I liked the most about the show is the characters. In most harem animes I would rate characters very low but this show is different. A few times I would start watching the show and forget to set the language to Japanese. I'm then horrified by some of the worse dubs I've ever heard. Okay they aren't the worst dubs. I hate them just as much as 90% of the dubs I've come across. That's okay though because the Japanese voice actors do a great job. ",1472,335,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The words  Worthless  and  Hilarous  come to mind when I watched this. I only even attempted to watch this because I found the idea of an anime based solely around a girl  Jazzercising  to be undeniably funny. It did suprise me a little bit with what seemed like an attempt at a story-line. But soon after that the show got to the real business at hand: Boobs. A whole 4 handfuls of 'em. The only thing that gets a workout from watching this show are your eyes from the constant motion of her boobs. It was funny for a little bit and then it was repetitive and then I stopped caring. They tried to keep it interesting by having her change outfits but that didn't really help by the end.,1477,340,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Its one episode that consist of watching a girl workout while she talks to you. There is NO story what so ever I think the only ppl tht may watch this is peaple that lke to watch other peaple almost like spying and if u like this you will love  sleeping with Hinako .,1478,341,2019-04-13 21:35:39

K-On!! is the sequel to the original K-ON!. This series introduces new story and songs in the K-ON! universe. This story is basically about the 4 older girls; Yui Ritsu Mio and Tsumugi and their last year before college. Azusa is worried that she will be left alone in the band but in the end she finds people to play with her. This season is not as good as the first one but what i enjoyed about K-ON! and K-ON!! is that they both are so real. No magic no aliens no super powers just high school girls playing in a light music band and their crazy adventures that could happen to anyone.,1510,372,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you just finished watching Shuffle! then this might be a bit of a bore. As the title suggests nearly the entire series is an over-view of the first. A little bit of original content at the end but mostly Shuffle! is a great but short anime. A series long refresher isn't something we should need.,1516,378,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you just watched shuffle! then prepare to be bored. Everything from episode 1-11 is a rehash of what happened in shuffle!. Every single second of animation in those episodes is from shuffle. However i did enjoy the episode 12 while it is the 12 episode of shuffle! memories you can think of it essentially as an  ova or the episode of shuffle! that never happened.,1517,379,2019-04-13 21:35:39

strawberry panic is a very heartwarming drama that even after the last episode it made me want to watch the entire series again and write my own ending. not that i don't like the ending but since my favorite character is tamao-chan i felt like her character wasn't really given a justice. sure it seemed like everyone got what they wanted in the end but it really broke my heart that it had to end that way--especially with tamao-chan :(,1527,386,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was the first anime I ever watched and to be completely honest I was...nervous to. I wanted so badly to get into an anime to enjoy it like my friends and just be able to get  lost  into a show. And Strawberry Panic didn't disapoint. ,1528,387,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I got bored real fast throughout most of the anime. Only closer to the end I felt like the story was getting more interesting. It's good to watch if you're into real cutesy-type things I suppose. And I loved the character's uniforms. Haha that's all I have to say. Didn't love it but I didn't hate it completely either.,1530,389,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Strawberry Panic is a shoujo romance anime. And a rather serious sensible take on romance at that. Not exactly an amazing anime but it wasn't terrible either. It's definitely not an anime for every individual primarily aimed at young Japanese girls (hence shoujo genre). But it isn't exactly a normal romance either the anime features no male characters thus the romance blooms between girls making this a shoujo-ai anime at that. And if any guys think there's hot girl-on-girl action you won't find it here thankfully. Nope this is a rather mature take on such relationships. It does have aspects of comedy and maybe a few annoying things here or there but by golly it's better than supposed 'romance' anime (yeah right) aimed at adolecent boys. This anime actually had me bored for a good deal of it a lot of filler and eventually it got to some surprisingly serious story. As such I wasn't paying attention to a good deal of the earlier episodes.,1531,390,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok.. WAY too yurilicious for my tastes. I’ll state thatirst. Secondly Kaori… stupid arc. It was like watching a shortened version ofhat damn Mandy Moore movie years ago. The ending I absolutely hated thending. It could have been far more creative but NOOOOO they just had to goith the usual type of ending for this type of story. Aggravates me quite ait. Yaya and Tama were the only two I liked in the story by the end evenhough what they did was expected. Either way I need to watch something superory and violent now. Five shoujo series makes me feel like a little girlow  *cries* (all 4 seasons of Marimite were marathoned prior to this),1532,391,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is my second review and once again very specifically selected. I'd like to preface this review by saying that I am a guy and I DID NOT give Strawberry Panic a 10 because it is a quintessential shoujo-ai anime nor am I gay. Rather this series is perfect in pretty much every way. The story is flawless. It has the right amounts of suspense drama twists (though in truth there isn't a huge plot twist or anything like that) and a satisfying ending. The characters are also very compelling. There really isn't a bad one in the bunch; each character plays their role no matter how big or how small. The story revolves around Nagisa-chan (a transfer student) and Shizuma-sama (the most revered girl at the academy). Both of these characters go through tremendous progression throughout the series as do a handful of the supplemental characters. But what makes Strawberry Panic truly fascinating are the development of the relationships between the characters. Some of the romances are portrayed to be straight while others are portrayed as gay (although obviously technically speaking they are all gay as there are strictly female characters). This dynamic really makes you re-think your definition of what love is or what it can be. And in contrast to my opening statement I've recently downgraded this series to a 9.5 out of 10. Still the best true romance around no one that watches this series and truly appreciates all of its subtleties could say any less in good conscious. But I guess I've come to realize why the pure romance genre is basically dead it's a bid old fashioned. Don't get me wrong SP is fantastic and bottom line you can't call yourself a fan of the romance genre if you haven't watched this series.,1534,393,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Strawberry Panic... Well it doesn't have a shocking plot or the best animation ever... but after all it's interesting somehow.,1535,394,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really like this anime it was great fan serive with all the brothers and gave lots of options as to who she could be paired off with. Though like most Harems they didn't say who the girl would end up with but maybe in the season coming out they will? My favorite character had to be the triplets they were so alike and yet different and they each suited her nicely. I didn't much like all the fighting that took place between the siblings but what do you expect when they each like the same girl and want her as theirs?  It was a good anime nevertheless and i'd def recommend it to those who like Uta no Prince-sama and Ouran High School Host Club (the triplets here remind me of Hikaru and Koaru especiall Tsubaki and Azusa).,1547,405,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is one of my favorite anime. it has a great plot and is very intersting. Also to me the charaters are very well drawn and very handsome. the main girl is very pretty (and also very lucky). so this anime is pretty much about a girl who moves in into a house with 13 boys because her father re-married.,1548,406,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It was not as bad as I thought it would be based off the first episode. The title “Brothers Conflict” is a double entendre. You begin thinking that it means “Brother Conflict” in that the female protagonist Chii has the conflict of picking which brother to date but surprisingly it actually works more as the brothers conflicting with each other. You think that the show will be all about romance (which obviously it is) but the main theme is actually family.,1549,407,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Brothers Conflict- SPOILERS AHEAD. ,1550,408,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Adorable adorable adorable. The ending or lack thereof drove me up the wall but if there is a season 2 on its way I will overlook that (its set up to be an obvious season 2). The only complaint I have is the brothers I liked weren't showcased enough! I have clear favorites and I am upset I didnt seem them enough! That however isnt a reason not to watch it. You might like different borhters than I did lol. Anyway back to the review. Its funny the story is different than most reverse harems and very very cutesy. Theres a talking squirrel. With a bow. Need i say more on the cutesy point. So the music was adorable and made me happy whenever I heard it. The characters well there were so many it was easy for them to be diverse and while that made it harder to remember names it also ensured you wouldn't get bored. Overall its a good anime completely worth watching. Enjoy the humor.,1552,409,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I don't understand why this anime has such a low rating. I'm reading peoples reviews complaining how they thought it would be about a girl who fights with her brothers because of the title  brothers conflict  or how it focuses on family or how the main character shows no interest to any of them in the end. ,1554,411,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Yes its a little wierd to think about and if youre really opposed to this kind of stuff then dont watch this. Either way if youve got an open mind this show is really awesome. The characters are really cool and amazingly good looking. With 13 main guys theres bound to be atleast one thatll catch your eye. Some obviously arent major characters so they wont appear as much but youll really like the anime overall. Its different for sure,1555,412,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime surely does need a second season. Also Love Live! might of stand out because the same studio made this anime as well. Bit this anime WAS AMAZNG. here's why,1570,427,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Accel World is a bit of a mixed bag. It's world and concept are familiar yet well done. It's comedy is great but it's drama is awful. The charecters are stereotypical but still enjoyable with one exception: the main character is the whiniest little b*!ch every. I know it's standard for the main character to start weak and get stronger but this guy is always moaning about stuff even once he is strong. Still if you can put up with him and don't mind seeing the plot  twits  (and I use the term loosely) from a mile away it's an enjoyable story that unfortunately ends just when it starts looking good.,1571,428,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you like SAO you will love accel world.,1572,429,2019-04-13 21:35:39
While worth watching for the story I felt as though Anime Fans lost the potential of a worthy story to comeback every week for 5 seasons.  The producing company lost the potentional of earning profits from selling series merchandise.  Anime-cons lost potentional fans in costumes.,1573,430,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is focused towards those with troubled childhoods issues wishes. all that emtional stuff. not only that but for once in an animes life its not so skin smart charming or perverted weirdo. I'm all for those guys but this guys different. Hes fat has 0 self confidence and hes a nice guy! sure all those others are  nice guys  but this guy is...you know hes different. Anyway i love this anime for all it is and i have never wanted any child to die in an anime this much before.,1584,441,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Accel World an anime based on the future where a boy that is bullied joins forces with soon to be friends to discover who created Brain Brust and for what purpose.,1591,448,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Accel World came out first by the same creator of SAO. However unlike SAO I found this series to be much more tolerable all the way through and here is why.,1592,449,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Accel world is the story of an unpopular timid boy at school who goes by the name of Harayuki Artia the only thing he seems to be good at are Virtual Games. He is then sucked into a different side of life by downloading something called 'Brain Burst' and meeting the girl Kuroyukihime. This story has been used multiple times down the years so didn't really intorduce anything new to the mix.,1595,452,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,1597,454,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well I started this anime the other day and I was kind of surpirsed. I am currently on episode 17 and that episode alone was a huge plot twist so I suggest watching until then. The overall story focuses on a fat kid who is constantly getting bullied and his only escape is the virtual world. While in this world he is taken under the wing of a young girl who expresses her love for him. The main characters are kind of dorky and do get on your nerves every so often but the overall story isn't too bad.,1598,455,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Delightful.,1599,456,2019-04-13 21:35:39
too early too tell how it is/will be but it's pretty funny with a bit of a rebellious guy that can switch bodies with people and creates mayhem thus far.,1600,457,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime was very charming.  It was definitely not the greatest anime I have ever watched but it was not a complete waste in my opinion.  There were moments where the atmosphere of the anime drew me in but then there were also some really cheesy annoyances as well.,1601,458,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,1602,459,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you're after a vampire anime with very little proper vampire in it go for Karin. I would recommend the sub over the dub any day but that's a given because I really don't like dubs. Either way this was mildly romantic although the romance plot was mainly at the beginning and the end of the series. The entire middle was arguably filler with the introduction of blundering vampire hunter Winner. They pronounce his name wiener which is a never-ending source of amusement. Most of it was cliche the vampires were bizarre and Karin was annoying.,1603,460,2019-04-13 21:35:39
it was really wired at first but then it went on and on and i started to understand it.i found it really funny but near the end i found it sad then i was really happy to find out what happened to karin and usui. i found it in every other manga or anime that if it sad near the end it would be happy right at the end. did you find that?,1604,461,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is one of those middle animes the plot truely isn't even a plot it sort of jumps all over the place. The animation is what you would expect for a early 2000's artist. ,1609,465,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"This is just a really cute anime. When I first began watching it I wondered what kind of ridiculous crap I had gotten myself into but really it's hysterically funny. There is no dramatic plot or villian just an interesting situation and a lot of awkward moments. The animation isn't wonderful and Karin (aka Chibi Vampire) is not a thrill ride but it is definitely worth watching.   ",1613,467,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Personally I preferred the manga over the anime the anime barely stayed with the plot of the manga and near the end it was taken entirely off track.,1617,469,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"J'adore cette série que j'ai d'ailleurs connu avant le manga. Les personnages sont très ressemblant dans la saison 1 et inversement dans la saison 2. C'est trois soeurs aux multiple talents sont fabuleuses. Elles possèdent d'ailleurs un charactère propre à chacune ce qui fait que chaque auditeur peut avoir sa préférence. Je ne me lasse d'écouter ce dessin animé même étant adulte aujourd'hui. ",1618,470,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you don't like bloody anime Hamatora is not for you.  Personally I can stand blood up to a certain point in anime as it is needed in the immersion factor if there are a lot of fight scenes.  Excessive amounts however I can't stand.,1619,471,2019-04-13 21:35:39

How do I describe this anime? I feel like there are so many things in my mind they're fighting each other to be written first. Well I guess I can start out by saying I won't go into the plot too much. The people above me/synopsis do a better job than I probably could and tbh this series is so lackluster that any spoilers could ruin the only likeable thing about it.,1622,474,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My review of Hamatora: The Animation,1623,475,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I honestly don't know where to begin with this delightful (read: sarcasm) review of this wonderful (again sarcasm) anime. Hamatora offers both sublime comedy wrapped up in neat visuals and striking art that compels the viewer to want more... Okay I can't keep that up; Hamatora is offensively shit.,1624,476,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,1625,477,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Por mas de que pueda parecer un anime muy simple a primera vista esta muy bien echo con una animacion alucinante una historia bastante profunda y personajes muy interesantes. 100% recomendado. ,1627,479,2019-04-13 21:35:39
After seeing Monster Death note and Legend of the galactic heroes I thought that I'll never see a good anime again. By good I mean - being entertain whole episode. Where you sit on your chair or sofa or lay on bed watching anime that hat 24 minutes to entertain you ...  After a very long time I felt the REAL joy of watching anime.. Worthy one.. That isn't dull and silly.. ,1628,480,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I usually don't like OP-from-the-start protagonists too much in shounen but this one is different. So far I have only watched 4 episodes. The anime follows the manga/mahwa very closely which is why I can't wait for how the anime will continue this nice manga/mahwa storyline. The animation is gorgeous the fights are hilariously huge and Saitama sure is one different hero.,1629,481,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Best anime ever it has every thing hero graphic best main charachter and i don t want to say about his hair is so amazing if you want to watch something watch this :),1630,482,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,1631,483,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I dont really get the story if there is any but its funny in a weird kind of way its almost like mocking different kinds of fictional characters and its just completly weird for anyone to actually put such an idea into an anime or manga.The animations are just awesome with all the queer expressions. Sounds are good too but the characters are made in a very different manner which I dont really like the idea of much but they are all still funny.Overall well done anime.,1632,484,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This will be a very short review as I could not bring myself to watch this whole series. The idea for this anime is decent as a spoof anime but the problem with this anime (as with other spoof anime) is that it lack plot and purpose. The story is unimagivative. This is a true example of a parody gone wrong. It's obviously meant to make fun of shonen anime lacks the ability to be anything more than a shonen anime itself.,1633,485,2019-04-13 21:35:39
DAMN 10/10! This anime doesn't even takes itself seriously... AND I LOVE IT!!,1634,486,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If there's any anime you start watching from this season let it be One-Punch Man for it will not dissapoint. You will love everything about this comedy about a guy who defeats everything with one punch (hence the name). Ridiculous enemies large fights and explosions all brought to an end by One-Punch Man in a moment leaving you with a hilarious aftermath.,1635,487,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I just started watching Kuroko no Basuke just when season 2 started.  Usually I start reviews by talking about how I came across this but by saying I saw season 1 is enough.  It'd be weird to start a show at the 2nd season.  My review is for those who've season season 1.,1636,488,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So I loved this even more than season 1. The tension builds up higher and the characters develop more and more. I really came to like Aomine-kun and of course above all Kuroko and Kagami. The battles became more fierce on the court and I am really excited for season 3 @ march 2015. Must watch!,1637,489,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My first review :),1638,490,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kuroko no Basuke 2 is the 26 episode continuation of the critically acclaimed sports anime from 2012. It has everything a good anime needs action comedy seriousness. Unfortunately my expectations for this are sky high which didn't bode well since this season added something I dislike to great anime series. Fan-service. The first season was an anime so enjoyable that cycnics of the sports genre people who didn't watch anime and anime lovers alike all enjoyed it. If you enjoyed season one put on your seatbelts for a continuation of the adrenaline-filled rollercoaster that is this anime. If you haven't watched season one then I recommend doing so before reading this review as it may otherwise contain spoilers for the events of the first season. I did write a review for season one last year but a misclick caused me to lose it all and I was too upset to write it up again. If I ever get around to rewriting it I'll put a link in this review.,1639,491,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was a really good anime and a good way to continue the first season of Kuroko no Basket.,1640,492,2019-04-13 21:35:39
You see the words Magical Girl in the key words and what is your main thought? Maybe something like Sailor Moon where you have a 10 minute transformation scene or maybe even Card Capture Sakura where she runs around trying to capture all the spirits of the cards. Well this show is a little bit different (although there are transformation scenes). Instead we have a girl who grew up in a pretty normal household. Sure her father found her in the woods but he treats her exactly how someone would treat a real daughter. He fusses over her tries hard to have her wear pretty clothing and makes amazing meals for her. She has a best friend she can ask for help and just is over all a pretty happy girl. The only thing that is different about her is that she is a 17 year old girl trapped in a 10 year old body but even that isn’t all that magical. She was never in a 17 year old body to begin with she just stopped ageing. They only speculate that she was cursed but from what I can tell there is no actual way that they know for sure. Before someone tells me that that has to be magical I am 26 but many people say I look 16 or 17 years old. It’s not all that magical and there are people in this world that look even younger then me like a young Indian girl who is about 22 years old and is only 2 ft 1 inch in height. For those interested look up Jyoti Amge.,1641,493,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1642,494,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If there was ever an anime that could pretty much sweep you off of your feet it would be this classic title. With a beautiful story that can even make the most toughest guy shed a tear (I should know I'm a complete bastard). The characters were funny and sweet especially our main protagonist Yucie. Her story alone touched my heart and I know it will touch yours as well so watch this wonderfully done anime and enjoy.,1643,495,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"I am not really a fan of this type of anime but decided to give it a chance. I was pleasantly rewarded in giving this anime a chance. It was super cute and left you feeling good by the end of the episode. Each episode wraps things up nicely so not like some animes where you are left hanging for episodes on end. There is alot of effort put on friendship and doing what is right in this anime. Normally this annoys me to no end but was done very well in this anime. There are a few moments where it can get annoying but the dynamic between the characters is comical and brought a smile to my face. I say it is worth at least checking out the first couple episodes to see what you think about it. ",1644,496,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I should preface this review by saying this is the first Harlock-related anime I've seen. Which means I'm missing 40 years of backstory but I took that into account when watching this anime. ,1645,497,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is one of the best looking cg movies yet period verry cool setting awsome air ships a crew of steam punkish pirates and a crazy kid thats in for the ride of his life when he meets Capiian Hurlock and learns the true meaning of freedome. nonstop action epic battles and a few silly moments makes this a great movie for those still new to  Captian Hurlock  and another beauityful addition to an amasing classic anime series. ,1647,498,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Shokugeki no Soma was one of the most anticipated series of Spring and it just recently ended 9/25/2015.  I actually couldn't wait for the anime to start so I ended up reading ahead.  So basically all that I watched was with me knowing in advance how everything plays out.  It was just me seeing how they were going to animate the series.,1656,505,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The anime Food Wars is one of my favourite anime. I just love the comedy moment with weird facial expressions and I love the diversity of the characters which all have a background story and a different connection to the main character.,1657,506,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'm as addictied to this show as the writers must be to food! While the foodgasms are graphic at times they portrey my love of food in ways I could never vocalize! I love the over exaggerated emotions animation and how much this show makes me laugh (and I mean loudly). This show was way outta left field for me and I'm very glad I gave it a chance! Special thanks to Giuzzys Cosplay! If not for her Mito  Meat Master  costume I dont know if I would have ever learned about this show; so follow her on FB & DeviantArt!,1658,507,2019-04-13 21:35:39

An anime about cooking so good it makes people hot. A friend recomneded I watch the show after reading the manga. Normally I am not one for ecchi however if it is done tastefully then I will watch (there is such thing as tasteful eechi?) The animation is to die for! The food looked so amazing I could stick my hand in the T.V. and take a bite out of it. The show also includes a memorable soundtrack. I adore the characters very much. I always cheered for them and wanted to see them succed in their own way. I would have liked a little more backstory behind Yukihira and his father. I do hope to see a second season in the future. ,1660,509,2019-04-13 21:35:39

so far from what i've seen the anime follows the story of the manga out of the first two episodes the manga is amazing hopefully the anime will be too. quite an amusing first two episodes at that i await for more episodes to come out and might i say about damn time they made this in to an anime i was happy when i heard that it was being made in to one. they slightly over did the foodgasms tho.,1666,515,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a really good anime. I like how they intensify cooking. its so intense it feels like an action genre anime. theres some ecchi i don't mind that much since the story is really good. the only part i dislike would be how theres a harem thing going on. i dislike harem which is why i rated lower than i normally would have. its the usual  tsundere  and  quiet girl  and  rich girl  with lots of pride thats all over him. although i am really glad he doesn't pursue any of them and there are no romantic developments (from what ive seen so far episode 16 curently) im just bothered by that. other then that good anime,1670,519,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series is amazing for outright laughing your self to death or tripping out on  Food Porn . The series has great animation and sound quality so far i have come to enjoy each of the characters presented and even the ones you feel you hate still have value and placement leading to a solid story setup over all. I would highly recommend it to any one looking for a good laugh or any chefs looking for a anime could also recommend to any chef players in mabinogi.,1673,522,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First off just to be clear i loved the Kampfer serie but this is just incredably stupid. It has absolutly nothing to do with the story not interesting what so ever all it is is animals talking about stuff that has absolutly no connections with the Kampfer anime. 1/10 simple as that!,1684,532,2019-04-13 21:35:39

So far this season Sound! Euphonium is one of the best looking anime this season its animation really is breath taking as the anime shows some scenes from the anime that really makes you say WOW and makes you speechless. Am not saying that this is the best anime of the season because its not finished airing and also theres differnt opinions on what the best anime is back to the point the animation is outstanding.,1692,539,2019-04-13 21:35:39

You know the surefire way for an anime to win its way to my heart? Have a bittersweet love story that makes me cry. Well apparently the creators of HAL know me all too well.,1702,547,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Hal is a one hour movie about a robot made to become human to comfort a girl Kurumi for the loss of her boyfriend. The girl's grandfather unable to go on seeing her suffering and shutting everyone out decides to make his robot an exact replica of Hal the deceased boyfriend - hoping that all this will in some weird way relieve her of her pain.,1703,548,2019-04-13 21:35:39
" 9.99 on itunes? I'm sold!  is the thought that ran through my head upon looking at this movie. Was it worth it yes and even more!",1704,549,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Having just watched the anime i wish i had more to say than the OVA was boring. It made an attempt to show what some people in real relationships sometimes face. The fact that Yoshikawa forgot Uehara's birthday. Yes it can happen and its understandable that Uehara would get angry but i really don't think that there's any need to waste 20 minutes instead read the summary. Uehara forgives Yoshikawa and her present to him is a kiss. Maybe by the end of the OVA i was meant to want to know about the story like how they became a couple but after watching the OVA and the bland characters i didn't feel that way.,1705,550,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If your looking for a nice slice-of-life comedy this is definitely a good pick. While the episodes are short its also part of its charm in that it focuses on those short sweet moments in life and for the most part gets straight to the point.,1710,555,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well since i only watched episode 1 i can't really tell if its good(because it was only fucking 3 min long). But it was funny i guess.  ,1711,556,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This short anime allways killed me every time. The humor is almost to much to take it may just be my sense of humor but it loved it to the last drop. This is most likely what would happen if an otaku and an average woman would get married. Absolute humor and awkwardness ans also the fact she has not idea what her husband is saying (As said by the title) because he allways talks in a way only people who read manga's would understand. 9/10 although it was short it left a smile on my face!,1712,557,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Very entertaining anime like snacks. Only disappointment I had was it’s ending in 3 min. Is it bad it’s being this short I don’t think so. Because if it was long there wouldn’t be good story line and it would became a messed up anime. It makes you laugh and realize somethings while teaching you some awkward might be facts which is happening in japan.    ,1713,558,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The basic plot of this borderline crack anime is that typical Japanese office lady marries rabid fanboy otaku. the quirky characters and their interactions with each other make this worth watching. It's a comedy based on clash of subcultures. ,1718,559,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"This is a great anime if you have five minutes to spare! It's sweet funny and a little serious inn all the right places. Pluss every episode is only 2-3 minutes long which personally I find to be a perfect lenght to it. The plot gets to the point and doesn't run all over the place like it would have done had this been a 22-25 min anime. So this is a refresing breath between some longer series. Recommended!

This is the perfect ending to Inuyasha all the characters finally come to a dramatic conclusion especially Miroku and Sango before I actually thought they kind of brought the story down because I felt like they weren't as interesting as Inuyasha or Kagome but in the Final Act they slowly become the most interesting characters in the show especially towards the ending. And Naraku becomes one of my favorite villians in anime in this one his motivation for his evilness is just something I never expected out of him if you watched the show already you know what I mean. For all of these reasons and more the Character rating score gets a perfect 10 out of 10.,1734,574,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The best thing about this season is that the story is moving much faster than it had before. With the start of the first episode it pick up where we left off and quickly progresses. So far there has been one filler and even that ended with a note of relevence to the rest of the story.,1737,577,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I couldn't wait for it to be dubbed in English I just had to watch it now ... and it was worth it in my opinion. I admit the story plot was a little hard to follow once in awhile but they covered things that hadn't been covered in the original series. Also they ended it better than they ended the original series. So overall I was impressed. One last thing: I cried during a lot of episodes ...,1738,578,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I know that many people weren’t really satisfied with the previous InuYasha due to repetition and even though InuYasha has always been my all time favorite anime I have to admit that it was once repetitive and really dragging on and on.,1743,583,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Princess Mononoke is one of the highest grossing films in Japanese history and newspapers and Internet sites have been singing its praises ever since it came out. Naturally when I had the opportunity to view a fansub of this I had to see it even if it was a fuzzy third-generation tape. I was impressed. Princess Mononoke is a film that stands right among Miyazaki's (and Studio Ghibli's) best. As an animation it's technically astounding with lush forests and fire-lit villages done with the same amount of remarkable detail and the CG sequences (mostly dealing with the Shishi Gami God of Life and Death) are simply sparkling. This is top-of-the-line stuff and it's a treat for the eyes and ears. (I can't wait to see this thing in the theaters!) Acting is very well-done and all the leads do a fine job. Lady Eboshi despite her pride is sympathetic because of what she has done for the people in her village. San finds herself drawn to Ashitaka though she has despised humans all her life as an adopted Wolf God. Ashitaka's sense of justice leads him to try to get the humans of Tatara Ba and the gods to find some sort of peace. The characterization is well-done if a little less fleshed-out than most Ghibli productions but it's still better than most of the stuff out there. (Interestingly enough actors in Ghibli films tend to be drawn from the live-action pool rather than veteran voice actors.) However this is one movie that is decidedly story-based. And what a story it is. From the first scene between Ashitaka and the cursed God he must defeat to protect his village to the ending it's gripping and absorbing with plenty of action and more than enough intensity to keep the viewer locked into the film. The musical score (by Joe Hisaishi of course) complements the film quite well and I really can't think of a single thing to really complain about this film. (But then again being an avowed Studio Ghibli fan does place a bit of a bias on my review doesn't it?) I have since seen this movie in the theaters as well as on DVD and I'm happy to say that while the dub job isn't universally perfect I found most of it to my liking. The unorthodox choice of Billy Bob Thornton as Jiko Bo struck a lot of fans the wrong way but I rather enjoyed his take on the character. Minnie Driver's rendition of Lady Eboshi was absolutely astounding and Billy Crudup is serviceable as Ashitaka. On the other hand I wasn't too keen on Claire Danes as San. More than once she delivers lines that are far too flat for the emotions being expressed on the screen. Overall though it's a decent dub job and worth viewing for a change of pace. Miyazaki Hayao has proven himself yet again a master in his trade and his work deserves no less than the highest praise I can give it. However do keep in mind that this isn't the usual Ghibli film and those expecting a slow-paced film a la Totoro or Porco Rosso will be rudely surprised but on its own merit Princess Mononoke stands on its own and stands tall at that. Bravo.,1752,592,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 Critic's Log - Earthdate: December 2 2012. Review #24: Princess Mononoke,1753,593,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As far as Anime movies go this is #1. Studio Ghibli does amazing work and this is the best of the best. You really fall in love with the characters and how they are trying to fix the world. I make a point of watching this movie at least once a year and every time I see it in stores I buy it as a gift for someone. It is a MUST WATCH.,1754,594,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Not only one of Studio Ghibli's finest films but one of the greatest anime films ever made. hell even the english dub is quite good. Not only a great entry point into miyazaki's work but a great entry into anime period.,1755,595,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Princess Mononoke is my favorite anime. I get this out of the way first so you know that this review is in no way meant to be any kind of objective. I heart this movie to an extent that even recognizing it has flaws is hard for me (pacing can be wonky? says you! convoluted story? take that back! too long? well … it isn't actually but some might say it is).,1762,602,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First off I LOVE Hayao Miyazaki and a lot of his movies. I fell in love with Studio Ghibli’s artwork music and pretty much anything about them. This is one of my all time favorite movies in fact. Just the story line is so beautiful about how man and nature are supposed to live side by side but when one fights against the other there can be both misunderstandings and consequences. The story is open to interpretation but it feels like a timeless tale. A lot of times I found myself believing that he could have made the story in this time frame and it would have had the same meaning behind the story. I’m going to sort of talk about what I consider part of this Psychology of this show and this is only what I feel is part of this. What you take from it may be different.,1765,605,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I had wanted to watch this movie for quite a while now; I’m a big fan of Studio Ghibli so I was trying to watch as many of their films as I could anyways. It lived up to my expectations and even went beyond them in some areas; however I can’t give this movie a higher rating because frankly the ending was awful. I’ll add my spoilers at the bottom so here’s your first warning. <-----,1767,607,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Was this supposed to be longer? There seems to be a lot of back storyut it barely touched on it. We get a glimpse of it but that isn'tnough. This OVA was only three episodes long and it should of haddded another episode so we could at least get to know the charactersnd sympathize with them. Instead I felt like I didn't really care whatappened to them. We also see a few characters who pop up a few timeshich just seems out of place. I think we were meant to have seen moref them.,1772,612,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really enjoyed this. It had everything that Robot Carnival didn't –ibrancy humour charm originality and something interesting toffer. It also doesn't make the mistake of being too long. Though Iouldn't really call the majority of this OAV  experimental  thistyle of films with quirky avant-garde direction tend to get boringnd repetitive over time.

I saw there were no reviews for this anime so i thought hey might as well do a review for my least favorite romance anime of all time. To anyone who might watch this and is new to romance animes or is just starting out I think you should start with something way better then this so justcome to me if you need to with any questions about that but anyway i watched this anime in one sit because when it started I  DID  like it but now i hate it. anyway i am writing this at about 2:00 Am so its not really that late (for me atleast) but i still think that i wasted my time with watching this.So basiclly you can say two cuz's live together beacuse the girls parents were killed in a car crash so the other cuz takes care of her. To start off with not only does she force him to do the laundry he also has to pay for everything she owns and he cooks about 99% of the meals. So as you can she shes a real great person but wait theres more she is scared of the color red beacuse you know the crash and blood comming from her parents but anyway she says shes very mature and is over her fear of red almost every episode but she never gets over it until i beleave ep 22 or 23. Also she said she would paint a picture with red in it and show it to her friends many times in the anime but she never does she might at on point of the anime pait some thing with red in it but i will leave that for you guys to watch if you want to ruin your life. So the guy cuz has a girl hes always liked and shes always liked him so as they start to for something girl cuz comes and breaks it then they start to form again but she breaks it again so finally they repair it and i will not tell you if she breaks it but i will say that i really liked the guy cuz and the girl he always liked as a couple but you can tell by how mad i am at this anime how it turned out i bet. So also this anime is full of how should i put it ummmmm i guess fakers one example is every thing i said about the girl cuz and another faker is the guy cuz as I said he said he liked the other girl but when you watch the anime you see he SPOILER ALERT PLESE DO NOT READ IF YOU DONT WANT SPOILERS PLEASE GO TO NEXT CAPS LOCK FOR REST OF SPOILER FREE REVIEW.................................................................................................,1777,617,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I used to wonder hw much sqeaky-voice moe cuteness was too much. Now I know. Also seeing that one girl smoking inside her house even in an anime makes me sick to my stomach. I mean come on: this is a kids show what are you trying to teach you audience?  Cancer is cool ?  Your teeth are supposed to be yellow ?  Being able to breathe is for losers ?  You're supposed to sound like a bullfrog with bronchitis when you get older ? I thought this show came out in 2005 not 1955. Having characters who smoke in your show is one thing but being totally cool with some girl smoking inside a house that has little kids living in it is something else.,1781,621,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series is perfect because no matter what season you're in there's an episode (or several actually) for it.  There's really no plot here.  However I will say that no other series has ever made me feel so nostalgic.  You'll enjoy watching the children and relating their life experiences and friendships to those you may have known when you were young.  This anime is lighthearted and silly.  The character Miu really keeps things hilarious.  She is adorable! The music on this series is silly and childish at times and heartbreakingly beautiful at times (particularly the ending theme  Classmate ). I like to watch this series in spring especially with the windows open and a breeze blowing in. ,1782,622,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Surprisingly I never would have thought they could pull off ANY anime with a photographer and camera as main character but they did. Its a hell of a note to action packed mass ecchi and a ridiculous yet compelling story of a retired war photographer who meets a young girl.  It all starts out when Saiga is assigned a mission to infiltrate an underground meeting of suspicious politicians to take some photos.  Lets just say he gets more than photos this time.  As he stumbles into the main attraction a young woman floats down from the sky.  The young woman see this and kisses the man granting him super human camera eye powers.  One look through the camera aim take photo and BOOOM! creates a serious destruction blast.  Well with realization that he has gained awesome powers he decides he will help the woman get away from the vicious politicians and there inhumane sickness.  If you don't already know the rest is about Saiga and the girl getting away from people who have gained other powers.  They need the girl but Saiga sees her in a different future.,1796,636,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I watched all of Speed Grapher but constantly hoping it would get better and then halfway through when had I given up on the hope it would improve asking myself why I didn't just drop it. So in my opinion it's a waste of time.,1799,639,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really like Speed Grapher. It's definetely a series with a unique premise. I feel it is one of those GONZO shows that do live up to it's potential but had an extremely tight budget when it came to animation. The dialouge and connection between the characters makes this easy to overlook. The English dub is one of those rarities where it tops the Japanese dialouge. One thing I like to note is I enjoyed the forbidden love aspsect between Saiga and Kagura which I felt was handled in an apporiate and more realistic way then most animes with major age gaps. Saiga is a grown ass man and not some sort of panty sniffing lolicon lover you can see throughout the series that he feels shame and denial over his feelings for Kagura and gets told by others that what he seeks with her is nothing but a fantasy. It's nice to see that sort of realism potrayed and reminded me of Koi Kaze in that aspect. Of course Speed Grapher isn't all romance but a insanely gripping story about greed with romance spread throughout. It's about two people against a world of power.,1800,640,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: I watched this a while back while waiting for the next to last volume of the Manga to arrive at my book store. The manga and Anime are extremly different. Definatly full of kidy moments despite the overwhelming heavey story. Most of the series are full of feel good episodes ending with Full moon singing her newest hit song when the song ties in to the story to match the mood it can be very powerful. some episodes were funny (episode 17 definatly the funniest) if your out to watch for content sadly despite the heavy theme you'll find the majority of the episodes lacking. for content all you need to watch is the first two and the last 10. The last 10 cary extremly heavy emtion and manage to tie up the end of the anime unexpectedly well.,1805,644,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I cried and laughed and manarthoned this show. I enjoyed the story so much and I loved the music as well. In my opinion this show has a feeling unlike most anime i have watched. The team that created this deserves serious recognition and while i was sad to see it end I'm glad it went the way it has. If you are feeling a little down or want some food for thought i recommend this show and for those who aren't either of those watch it anyway i doubt you will be disappionted.,1806,645,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Every once in a while after I finish watching an anime somethingxtraordinary occurs; I'll sit back and blankly stare off into space.he anime will have affected me so deeply that I remain completelyumbstruck even after the credits have finished. Full Moon wo Sagashites one of the few animes to have instigated this phenomenon; after Iinished watching it all I could do was gape at my empty computercreen.,1813,651,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show was the first time I ever actually laughed cried got angry with and sympathied with all at one. It took me on a roller coaster of emotions and actually had a really good end. It had a great balance of seriousness and comedy and great character development throughout the entire series while still keeping the magical girl aspect. It had some decent life lessons in there and great plot twists. Overall I think this is a great anime to watch and it's worth the 17 hours of your time for sure. Make sure you watch it all the way through because the ending is the best I've ever seen. Even better than the ending of UFO Baby (aka Daa! Daa! Daa!),1815,652,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is by far the most awful anime I have ever had the unpleasure of setting my eyes upon. Even if the animation is relatively nice the story itself and the terrible characters aren't worth the trouble.,1821,658,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I watched it all in one night and the only reason I finnshed it because I was hoping that the story was going to pick up. It did some what at the end but it was werid and was almost as if they wanted it to make since at the end. It was creepy and just made me feel in some seens that your watching the main charter getting raped and I'm sorry but that just made me vary grossed out. I just think it was done badly I have never played the game that it was based on and so maybe there was not much of a story to go with.,1822,659,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I've only watched two episodes. Two episodes is enough to know I won't be finishing this misogynistic crap. When has it become okay in our society to accept abuse towards women as natural even in fictional material? I can't call this entertainment because it certainly does nothing but induce an overwhelming urge to break things in a room viewed through the lens of rage. There is no entertainment value that can redeem Diabolik Rapists from the utter tragic fuckfest these first two episodes present.,1826,663,2019-04-13 21:35:39
“Diabolik Lovers  is a horror anime based on the visual novel by Rejet. ,1827,664,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The vampire genre is becoming increasingly toxic. For almost the last decade it has been over-saturated with Edward Cullen like pretty boys who are basically there to be the main part of a wish fulfilment fantasy about vampires who aren't even an accurate representation of the creature called a vampire to begin with. And this is in all media not just anime. And wether it's an anime or a blockbuster movie it's becoming increasingly harder to break the mold that has been established. I know all this... And yet I still didn't see any problem with watching Diabolik Lovers. My thought process was basically 'Okay... This is a reverse harem anime. I'm looking for reverse harems. Okay I'll watch this. What could possibly go wrong?!' The answer is everything. I wasn't planing nor did I want my first review on this site to be a negative one but if I don't unleash all my anger generated by this anime I'll probably go insane so here goes nothing.,1828,665,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I tried to enjoy this anime but it was just really shitty. I discovered this ages ago whilst I was going through a phase of being obsessed with reverse harems huge waste of time.,1829,666,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I actually enjoyed this anime. I binged watched it so that means it was actually pretty good if I do that.,1830,667,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,1831,668,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wtf did i just watch . I managed to watch 4 episodes ( yes i was that patient )  but this shit makes absolutelly no sense . 0 plot at all . who would even make this kind of anime . Pure shit . I dont recommend this to anyone .,1832,669,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It was very.... rapey. It will make you a bit uncomfortable. I stuck with it hoping it would redeem itself with the possibility of the girl becoming powerful enough to defend herself or maybe one of the vampires develops an affection for her and protects her. But no. It starts rapey and ends rapey. ,1833,670,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ouch the reviews are brutal for this one.  Look just accept it for what it is; an otome game based anime for people with serious vampire fetishes.  It's pretty true to the genre too.  They aren't gentle loving sparkly guys.   They are bloodthirsty vampires! There's no rape no sexual assault and not much of a story unforntunatley.   The characters were pretty good all expect for Kanato who was like a creepy sadistic little Momiji.  Seriously who would choose to date that little freak in a game?!   Also BE warned: I don't recommend watching it with subtitles unless you speak fluent japanese.  The sexualized abuse just comes off as funny ( bitch-chan  and  boobs-chan  -wtf?)   And omg the OVA is boring.   I really wish they had just gone to the hotsprings in that episode. No wonder it never aired.   My advise is this don't overthink this one and just watch it by yourself where no one else can judge you for your smutty taste in anime ;),1834,671,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is a very good one. I like the story line to this anime. However I do not like how short the episodes are and how few episodes there are. I wish that they had more epsidoes that were longer to build up some of the characters and story line more. I like the animation of this anime because the characters have really good details to them like their eyes mostly and also the scenary has very good details to it. I like the music in this anime especially the opening and the closing songs. I also like some of the music that is played trough out the anime. I also like that the songs in the anime do not drown out the voices of the characters. I also love most of the characters voices. I love most of the characters in this anime becasue they are really awesome people however there are some characters that I really hate and feel like they should go away. I love that almost all the characters are vampires and also that they are crazy vampires on top pf that. Overall this is a really good anime if you are into vampire animes.,1839,676,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1845,682,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,1846,683,2019-04-13 21:35:39
OKAY! I know this has been mentioned on different posts but this series was based off of Drama CD/Game Series of the same title. I jumped into the anime after doing a bit of research on the series reading summaries about the characters and their routes from the game. I also looked for translations which the first game really didn't have much there were several summaries for the game though. I also found myself looking up the drama CDs for the series as well while I watched the series.,1847,684,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To be honest I'd give this anime as a 5 out of 5 to someone who enjoys reverse harem with a focus on the boys. These boys are very sexy however I hate the sucking sounds and the constant gasps. Those sounds are really what made me give this anime a rate of 4 out of 5 stars. However I can understand a lower score being given due to a cardboard cutout chick as the main character(most likely because this was originally a dating game) the episodes only being 15 min each and not covering much plot in each. Still the story is easy to follow(for what little story there is since only the boys are really given any detail) and the boys are cute enough to keep me glued to each episode dispite the flaws. I'd like to think the manga covers much more and this was just a nice gift to all the fan girls dying to hear each one's voice more after the game but I haven't looked yet. This is definitely not an anime for those who love mainstream animes or expect a lot out of the animes you watch. If you love sexy men watch it for the men. If you don't then don't bother because you'll end up just getting annoyed with it because what else can you expect from an anime made off of a dating game? Really makes me want to play the game now though.<3,1848,685,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Honestly... I barely got through the series luckily it was short.,1849,686,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The only thing I liked was the art the characters are lacking and so is the story. Just the whole cliche helpess girl with a family of vampires who all want her because she somehow is more appealing than other humans. Too many characters with reasons why they have such warped personalities but not enough time to go into each one they bit off more than they could chew.,1850,687,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Straight after the appallingly bad Brothers Conflict comes a new reverse harem. Happy happy joy joy. Will this manage to be better than BroCon and perhaps even rise to the level of 'almost tolerable'? Hah fat chance! This irredeemable pile of excrement is the story of a young woman being surrounded by young vampire guys that are hellbent on making her life as miserable as possible and nothing else. It's basically your regular harem show but with a colossal heap of domestic abuse added to help separate it from its ilk. The setting is about as cliché as they come and there is nothing new to be had from the plot and backstory both of which are barely even there. Describing them as 'perfunctory' would be a stretch and it would dilute the word to such a degree that it would be rendered meaningless in the process and we can't have that now can we?,1851,688,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Um guys.  Diabolik Lovers  literally means Evil Lovers. What do guys expect with a title like that? Intelligent nice and beautiful bishis?,1852,689,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Dropped like a bucket of toxic waste. I've got no clue where the story is going and I don't plan to watch any more to find out. Far too abusive and rapey for me to enjoy. ,1853,690,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1854,691,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Honestly when I first heard about this series I thought it was going to be like Amneisa or Kamigami no asobi and have a great story with awesome characters. It gives good characters and i'm being honest here and a story thats about average. The Drawing line I have is that the main guys only treet the main heroine as nothing more than Food accept for one and that being Ayato Like at first he did but honestly i do feel like he grew feelings for the girl and it shows in sutle ways. Its a Good idea don't get me wrong but when they put it all together the anime just fell flat on its ass...The Characters kinda saved it for me cuz i wanted to keep on learning about them and how they got this demented. I'll watch the second season when it comes out and i just kinda hope they learn from their mistakes and try to make the characters more then just blood hungry sadist assholes at least over half of them anyway.,1855,692,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Shows like these are the reason why I stay in on the weekends,1856,693,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was the first anime I''ve ever watched and it was reccomanded to me by a friend.I confess that I was unsure about watching thisor notbut I'm glad I didn't knew any anime sistes like this oneat the timebecause I would have missed out a lot.As being saidI rewatched this one a few days agoand I was happily surprised that I really liked it once again.I'm not a fan of the harem genre mostlybecause I tend to get attached to much with one of the guy/girl and get really dissapointed in the end.But this show it's truly an exception :) Although I really loved itI must say that it lacks a lot of thingsand I believe I'd rather classify it as a guilty pleasure for me rather than an actual anime,1857,694,2019-04-13 21:35:39
     Love actually isn't the the main theme for this anime. It's based off an otome games so you would pick which guy's storyline you wanted to follow. However in an anime you can't bend the story and pick whichever guy you choose. The first half of the show is a taste of what each character's route is like in the game. The second half is the basic storyline. ,1858,695,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1859,696,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I...Don't even know where to begin? I honestly thought that this was going to have a very interesting story surronding it. I watched the first episode a while ago and since I was bored I decided that I would finish it so I started it from the beginning.,1860,697,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Everything about this anime is seductive yet at the same time off-putting. If I had to describe this in one word it would be pretty. The art is beautiful and I could listen to the guys’ voices all day long. I also loved all the music. The fact that this was made from an otome game is quite apparent from the sudden reverse harem and total lack of Yui’s character development. Whereas many harem/reverse harem anime point toward at least one girl/guy being more important than the rest this is just like an otome game giving all the guys equal appearances and equal relationship development (though Ayano does receive a bit more).  Yui does have more personality than the protagonist of Amnesia though and the guys do have a bit of backstory.,1861,698,2019-04-13 21:35:39
While I enjoyed seeing vampires portrayed as the predators they are I can't get over how anti-climatic and poorly thought out the story was. They never full tied up any loose ends. The animation is well done and I like the clock that shows which episode your watching. However the story is full of holes and only one part of the story comes to resolution. And that resolution was disappointingly anti-climatic. It just seems like the rushed through the story and skipped major parts.  ,1862,699,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1863,700,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To be honest the only thing that kept me watching this anime was the brilliant artwork. Honestly. The characters look really good and I think the artwork was excellent. I think I watched this anime for the artwork rather than the actual plot. There isn't actually a plot though until the last 3 episodes or so. Most of the anime is just the Sakamaki brothers constantly draining Yui's blood in a variety of sadistic ways. It's kind of a turn-on if you're into that stuff I guess. Really depends who you are.,1864,701,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I actually enjoyed this anime quite a bit. Although if you don't like vampires or have triggers you definitely won't enjoy it.,1865,702,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love this anime! The only thing i don't like is that the brothers abuse her. I love vampires anything vampire i love but they could be nicer. I have binge watched this show and its amzing. Sometimes i dont get it but eventually you understand i would reccomend this to anyone who loves vampires!!!!,1866,703,2019-04-13 21:35:39
WARNING THIS REVIEW IS BASED OFF OF 5 EPISODES - TDLR/ Overall at the end for those that don't want to stare at a screen.,1867,704,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First off it's based on a game of the same name to that right there should be a red flag. There is no comprehensable plot until after episode 7. Each episode after the first goes through scenes with Yui and each of the boys which are painful to watch and involve her abuse. I watched in all with good grace when I was recommended it from the Vampire Knight page and tried to like it but it flopped for me. It seems like an amazing concept it just played out more like a visual novel rather than an anime. ,1868,705,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Some may agree some may not. But hey this is MY opinion.,1869,706,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you aren't a fan of domestic violence or borderline rape please save yourself the trouble and don't watch this anime.,1872,707,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime should not be watched with the thinking of an anime. Watch this thinking of it as a domination galge.,1873,708,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,1874,709,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was tempted to turn this off after the first twelve-ish minutes during the rape scene - yes this anime has a rape scene. It is the first anime with a sexually explicit male rape scene that I have ever watched and I feel very guilty for liking it. I though it was strange how Ayase fell in love with his rapist (harks back to the caveman mentality of  I'll drag her (or him evidently) back to my cave and rape her (or him evidently) until she (or he evidently) loves me ).,1878,710,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ayase is probably the only character I liked. The first 2 episodes he is a little 2-dimensional character wise. His character really starts to show in the 3rd episode and it's an improvement. The rest of the cast is rather static and bland with little to go on. The relationship between Ayase and Kanao is a little odd with a D/s vibe to it and is definitely a little extreme.,1879,711,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,1880,712,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok so i personally wouldn't say its the best anime that i have watched but overall a good anime for the yaoi fans. The story is very unique as it is based on a young man (university student) who's cousin sold him because he is in dept for some reasons and a very rich man buys him for a few billion pounds. good animation but less realistic for me but if you like it im happy for you:) i think the sound was great but i always watch it in subbed but it wasn't as bad as maid sama sound so im impressed.,1881,713,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Toradora Special AKA Episode 26 is an extra episode for that romantic comedy anime based upon a novel. This OVA is literally original video animation the novel ended where episode 26 did. One would expect something post-narrative for this but this is just filler which is a big disappointment. Forget the romance this is just a little comedy and plenty of cooking. Such as shame such wasted potential here.,1902,734,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Overall Id have to say I was impressed enough with this anime to actually reply by making a review. The story line itself was pretty much a team vs team based storyline with historic references along with humor hot loli chicks (dont judge me o.o) and gun blazing super powered sword slicing action. Id have to say I am very impressed with the animations although they do sheen quite a few things that is kind of unncessisary I still liked the show and its not too much of a distraction. As for the gun battles they are kinda basic cowboy bebop kind of feel (with less bullets) they could put more attention on the guns themselves with more flash to put more focus on the single shots but otherwise I didnt see any issues with it. The characters are all quite humorous and I can definitely see this anime being something a lot of fanbase could follow.,1907,739,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm always amused when I stumble across an anime by accident and it happens to be quite good. This was most certainly the case when I found Hidan no Aria. It has a little mix of everythig from across almost all genres. There's comedy action adventure romace a budding harem etc. What made this one interesting is that it seemed to incorporate history's most famous and notorious characters and gave them a common path. I would rather not give anything away here but it's definitely worth watching. I'm not one of those people who will rant and rave in a long litany of pros/cons. It's something you have to see for yourself.,1916,748,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wish the animated version was longer but hey can't have enerything. I highly recommend reading the manga because went much further than the OVA that were made.  In the manga you really get to see how the two characters develope together. It also doesn't leave you hanging like the OVA did.,1924,756,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really enjoyed this anime and it happened to be one of the first yaio I watched. It could  done to be a little longer. But overall it was very enjoyable anime.,1925,757,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was goooood. The art was lovely the characters were pretty developed and the scenes were hot. It was funny and kinda cute even though Morinaga totally took advantage of the situation. One of the better yaoi anime I've seen. It's probably also one of the most risky.,1926,758,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I thought I was going to enjoy this anime but it wan't what I thought it was going to be at all. The story just doesn't flow well and the character's personalities aren't memorable.

Kokoro Connect is about a group of friends who are messed with by some  godlike  entity who can possess other humans.  All he wants is to be entertained so he sets parameters and messes with the cast of the show.  One of the ways he messes with them is by swapping their souls.  As you can imagine this causes a lot of confusion among the characters and also leads to a decent amount of fan service.,1935,766,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Kokoro Connect was not what I expected... The character development was amazing but it was very sad. The animation is very cute but the anime as a whole has a very creepy air to it... I feel like it is a matter of preferance if you would like it or not... If you're in it for characters then it is amazing but if you're looking for romance I would look elsewhere.,1944,775,2019-04-13 21:35:39

nope.  didn't like this one at all.  the drama was the cheesiest ive seen in an anime i think.  every single demon they were struggling with was like the most cliche or stupid thing. or maybe it was just in the presentation? i don't know but the whole thing had me scoffing and rolling my eyes and shaking my head.  I feel like a teenager who has never watched an anime before would think this is the best. but for me i thought it was just terribly boring with stupid hoaky and abrupt drama with a very unresolved ending. the only reason i was holding on was to find out what heartseed was all about.  this must be one where the anime producers even got bored and stopped making it even though the manga goes on to tell the good parts of the story so yeah maybe it gets a lot better i don't know i don't care.  the characters were all incredibly annoying from start to finish and the story was repetitive and boring and the drama was just oh my god.  ,1949,778,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I had high hopes for this series since it sounded so different compared to what I normally watch. But the fan service (shiny butts shiny butts everywhere...) is way over the top. I normally enjoy a little fan service but the episodes have minimal plot and characters that I don't care about.

The best thing about a good mystery is having all the information needed for the audience to solve the mystery cross the screen before the protagonist solves the crime. So when the mystery is solved the audience knows they had the chance to solve it and (if  it's a really good mystery) they missed putting it together but they remember it being there and it makes the resolving of the case believable.,1968,795,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sadly this is not one of the better animes this summer. The characters are odd and not easily likable it's not written or directed well the voice for one of the supposed main characters is weird speaking of which I'm not entirely sure who the main character is and the animation is weird and kind of turned me off.,1978,802,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai is pretty average it has some interesting elements that keep me watching but it never really breaks out of being a pretty generic harem even with the shepherd elements.,1979,803,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I seen the tag  based on an eroge  so immediately expected it to be the typical harem of  I can't choose which girl to go with so I am going to be a dirtbag instead . Totally was not. Had a nifty storyline very likable characters and portrays some development. Has quite a few great scenes. Oh and cuteness. A lot of cuteness.,1980,804,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru starts off strange.  A young boy is told that his grandfathers dying wish is for him to enroll into a prestigous school for girls.  As if that isn't interesting enough they seeminglessly make this boy into the perfect girl.  And I mean P-E-R-F-E-C-T.  So perfect in fact that it's extremely refreshing.  After watching shows where the male lead is a bumbling idiot and can't do the simplest thing without some big breasted heroine holding his hand watching OwBnK was an extremely enjoying experience.I had always passed this title because of Da Capo.  I enjoyed Da Capo and how it was produced but I wasn't sure if I could handle another show drawn and roughly editted the same way.  They even have repeating character designs that are apperent almost immidiately.  The plot devolpment and character choices were also repeats of Da Capo and I saw that coming a mile away... What I did not see coming was how well all of this came together to form one of the best sex change shows I've ever seen.Mixing a blend of Slice of Life Romance and Drama is something every anime attempts to do.  Some examples would be Kannon Clannad and Toradora.  Although I wouldn't rank OwBnK amoungst them it does deserves the next level down.  Fluent in every aspect of the show OwBnK takes the most interesting parts of a man turning into a girl and flaunts them in a modest manner making the male turned female lead into an extremely lovable character.,1981,805,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story is about a boy who finds out that his grandfathers will requests him to go to an all girls school. He can't go as a boy so his childhood friend helps him learn how to be a girl and dress like a girl. Throughout the anime he makes new friends and deals with the varrious issues of being a boy undercover in an all girls school. The reason his grandfather wanted him to go to this school was to be closer to his mothers memory. His mother had attended the school and been the Elder ( a student who elected and performs duties mainly being a good role model for young ladies). According to the plot on this site it's implied that this is supposed to be the focus of the show but it's not. It's more like a chapter or a small side story than the main focus. The main focus tends to be more on him being the Elder and keeping his gender a secret from all but a select few. ,1984,808,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The anime was great over all the first 2 episodes have mature things so i suggest to skip them unless you're mature. There will be spoilers. So to start the beginning episode really tries to pull in the viewer but not the way i get pulled in. O think it was creative to put a guy that is besically a slave to girls. The only other anime that I can think is like that is High School DxD. It also had it's funny moments like the running from all the women on the other planet. The sounds were very good and I heard things that i wanted to hear clearly and things i didn't want to hear actua;;y cut out of my head. Probably just how I function XD. The characters could have better backgrounds and detail but overall this was one of the better animes i liked for it being an eechie anime.,1998,820,2019-04-13 21:35:39

In-frickin-credible.  Terror in Resonance is an extremely short anime.  Many short animes tend to move too quickly or don't finish their full storyline.  However Terror in Resonance was perfect.  It finished everything in a perfect pace.  The animation was beautiful.  The story was deep.,2028,849,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When the first episodes of Zankyou no Terror were released I was prepared for this to be the best anime of the year.  This was an anime that I was anticipating for well over a month before its release.  The plot looked like it was taking on difficult subject matter in a mature style.  After watching the last episode I conclude that it did handle many elements with great skill but it is not the masterful work that I expected.,2029,850,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story of these two brining light to what happened to them and their peers is beautiful. The charcters are well developed the plot is amazing and intelligent. It really does get you thinking and the emotions with in the music capture what is going on perfectly. This series has an amazing harmony and an intresting concept on dealing with an issue. They go out of their way to stop bad things from happening.,2030,851,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Despite having a great selection of anime this summer season2014 zankyou no terror HANDSDOWN gave me the best experience. No it didn't have gret mecha fights in plot twist like in Aldanoah Zero not the lovely gore from akame ga kiru or the intense character development and themes like in Tokyo Ghoul. It has a hypothetical situation where  what if two kids decide to terrorize Japan to get revenge  type of situation. Not to give so much away but It really says a lot about today's world and its politics. The dirt of country's are kept under wraps as they try to compete with one another. The consequences are later seen in the series. As a thriller it did perfect in its job of keeping me hooked even by episode 1 by all means it had one of the best first episdoes I've ever seen! Its pacing may waver at some times but I believer it does it's job in letting us see different aspects of the show. Of course the music has one of the BEST OSTs ever!!! Yoko Kanno composes it!!!! The music really pulls together and fits their scenes together and really touches your heart. By episode 11 you will be amazed at how you'll want to cry by even hearing the soundtrack by itself. The openings and endigns are are also so beuatiful and really fit the show perfectly. The animation is definitely in its league of its own its simply mindblowing. The backrounds and the abstaract color palettes are simply stunning. The only problem I may I have with the show is understanding Five's character development. I simply believe her relationship with Nine wasn't explained well enough and either was her psyche or Nine's either for that matter. I though Lisa was a realistic character herself. Some may complain that she was useless but she is simply you average bullied girl who honestly did want to help Nine and Tweleve please dont be so hard on her. Also the show does NOT focus on Lisa. From the last episode it shows that it does focus on her PERSEPECTIVE  but not LISA the character herslef. In speaking about the ending all I can say is that it was the only logical meaningful and fitting way to end such a series. Many may not be satisifed with it maybe the show should be renames zankyo no feels but I can honestly say it wrapped up the show and ended it the way it should have.,2031,852,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I never wrote any reviews even though I've been watching anime for as long as I can remember. This anime is WHY I watched them still in 2015. This jewel has everything you ever need for a good series. The characters are lovely you'll get attached to all of them some you won't love but not cause it's bad development with the character but just cause you don't like that type of person. The animation is flawless... From episode one to the end it is action packed full of story life death decisions sacrifice and alot of emotions. I mean yes i usually enjoy the action anime but this one will reach you deep in your soul it will burn something in you.,2032,853,2019-04-13 21:35:39

i really enjoyed this anime very appropriate in today's age. I got extremely attached to the characters especially 12 he's so adorable. Overall very interesting anime. I think I finished it in a day or two.,2034,855,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime's plot and characters are phenomenal and they are what drives the show. The game of cat and mouse is superb and the animation and music add the the enjoyment. My one problem and the reason this anime received a 7/10 from me instead of an 8.5 or 9/10 and maybe because I'm from the United States is the way the depict the U.S. Military and F.B.I. Now when you watch the show you'll find out quickly that one of the  American  agents is obviously not working with the interests of the American Goverment in mind but rather their own interests. They also depict the U.S. Military in a very negative light especially in the last part of the last episode. Once you see that scene anybody would agree that U.S. soldiers and officers would never do that without approval of both the American AND Japanese governments. Other than that the show is amazing and very well paced. I reccommend it to all.,2038,859,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Zankyou no Terror was seriously one of the best Anime I ever watched. It was carrieing out such a heavy and dark atmosphere and it was definitely thrilling to the end. During the first episodes I saw a lot of parallels between this one and masterpieces like Death Note and I was really enjoying watching another  Duel of Masterminds . ,2039,860,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm always the one who sees everything in some sort of  good light  but for me it's definitely not overrated ranking! This piece of art and I didn't hear about it even once I've found it by coincidence and I feel so amazed.. I know it's not that original how it could be but sometimes it's even better to put a story like this the simpliest way. I really love the concept of two sides one should be evil and one good in the eyes of society but then you see everything in different view and sympatize with the  bad side .. for me this kind of story is like a nice piece of cake after good lunch! + qb prize for the best soundtrack and saddest ending recently.. Thank you! :'(,2042,863,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I would defanitly recommend watching this anime it has this captivating charm that u rarley find in anime these days and it will make u fall in love with it very fast the story is simple yet very developed in a way so in conclusion it's only 11 episodes it's fun so why not watch it?,2043,864,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hello all and welcome to another review! Let's have a look at this little show shall we?,2050,871,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you're a fan of anime that really f**ks with your head and makes you think outside the box then you should watch this. ,2051,872,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,2053,874,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story is very twisted how I like it but I hate that they didn't continued it. At the end I was like ' What? Thats it?'. The animation is great I love it. The opening is pretty cool but the ending is horrible I always skipped it. The characters are amazing even thougt I don't remember the names of some of them...Overall  Umineko deserves a 9 for all of the above plus the thing that I love bloody and mindfucking animes.,2054,875,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,2055,876,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So  maybe if you have seen already the sound novel this was like a sad animation. I bet Umineko lovers were expecting more and were disapointed again by Deen studios. But oh well it happens and maybe they didn't have the budget to cover every interesting detail or moment of the series. ,2056,877,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hrm.. where to begin. If this was uncensored from the geto it’d be one hell of a violent show. On the other hand due to it being aisual novel originally A LOT was left out and that left me greatlyisappointed. I will point out based on what I read in the forums not manyiked the last episode. I for one enjoyed it quite a bit and hope an OVAeries or another season is made since it left the ending very open.,2063,884,2019-04-13 21:35:39
What the hell? When it finished I only had a vague idea about whatappened. The story jumped around constantly. It got really bad whennge came into the show. They also did a terrible job at explaininghings. It felt like the show was constantly contradicting itself. Ieally don't know what to say because I don't know what I just watched. thought it was just a big mess. If I have to give the show oneomplement it would be that the music was pretty good.,2064,885,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I started this anime having only read a few summaries and reviews on it. The tags seemed pretty cool so I thought 'Why not?'. This anime was...I have no words. The feels I got during this were destructive. ,2069,890,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I came to The Fruit of Grisaia with no prior knowledge of it. Having not played the visual novel it is based upon. This review is written after having watched the first five episodes. Unless I find myself with a remarkable presence of free time in the future I will not be returning to The Fruit of Grisaia.,2074,895,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really liked the story and characters but some of it was quite disturbing. It for sure is mature rated for a reason. The last few episodes were the upsetting ones. Great anime but if you easily have nightmares or get have trouble sleeping after intense storyline; I reccomend not watching last 4 episodes before bed. I myself had to watch something else afterwards.,2075,896,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I wasn't impressed with the Fruit of Grisaia at all. But given that this is just the first series I guess it is still possible that the show will get better in the future if it manages to overcome the flaws and plot inconsistencies which at the moment are substantial.,2078,899,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Grisaia no kajitsu at first appeared like generally most anime with the characters having their quirks and such how ever the story very much advance into serious mode after the first few episodes with each character having their own individual saga and how the main character helps them leaving massive ammounts of shock factor due to the ways the man used his skill and cunning to help and protect his new classmates. the story took an even deeper turn coming to the story and saga of the final character not to have her own saga. it took a very intense and dramatical turn tugging at every one of my emotions having me feel lost within the emotions exploding within me. the immense backstory that each character held was an amazing result of the effort people put into this despite the backstories being each their own personal experiences of hell with the final girl having her experience of hell being worst then death itself and the past leading to an finale event that kept me on my seat. my heart was trembling at the finale and i can say i truely enjoyed this anime,2080,901,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Imagine if you were to be in this series. Imagine if you were Yuuji Kazami himself. I know touching isn't it? The Fruit Of Grisaia (Grisaia no Kajitsu) does exactly that. I wouldn't resemble this series to trigger any kind of feels at all but it did. Instead you would portray it as something to be sympathetic about especially in The Eden of Grisaia (Grisaia no Rakuen) but i'll get to that later.,2081,902,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Positive: Great story that really draws you in.  You can also really get attached to the characters.,2090,911,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I enjoyed D.Gray-man.  The characters evolved in each episode.  The sound track was right-on.  I would have liked to know a little more about Allen's background and who the 14th was and how it involved Allen. As the series neared the end the characters seem to mature as they continued their battle against the Earl especially Allen as he grew into his powers and Lena-lee also when both their innocence evolved.,2091,912,2019-04-13 21:35:39
What can I say this is the type of anime that has great potential but never succeeds in achieveing its promise. First I wanted to mantion that I know that the anime/manga isn't finished.,2092,913,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well i'm obviously gonna be biased about this anime since my pic is already from the anime. Well this anime is first of animes to actually have caught my attention i usually watch animes just for the sake of passing the time yet since so many of my friends were talking about it so i decided to gave it a try( actually they pester me so much i gave in). Suprisingly i actually enjoyed it and proceeded to the manga.,2093,914,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a good anime because it is really good and the story line of the anime is really good and also easy to follow. I love most of the characters in this anime becasue they are really awesome people and they also protct others witch is just plain old epic. The animation of this anime is really good. ,2095,916,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2096,917,2019-04-13 21:35:39
D.Gray-man is an anime dear to my own heart so this review is biased in every way but honestly how can you watch it and not love it the story is captivating and the characters (for the most part) are so lovable it made it easy for me marathon 20 episodes a day. i was so emersed in this anime and the world it created. the best part about it it wasnt that fillery for an anime with 103 episodes despite having 6-7 comic relief episodes usually after a tough loss for the exorcists. it also didnt have the good guy win every time i mean even at the end it hinted toward the power of the earl kinda crazy isnt it? not many anime will do that. ,2097,918,2019-04-13 21:35:39

How disappointing. One of the best series turned into a cheesy tweenage harem romance. It started out strong with a good dose of sexual humor to lighten the mood and reacquaint viewers with the main characters along with their uncanny ability to fall into questionable perverted moments. If real life could have even half the awkward boob grab moments in this series boys would hit puberty around the age of 8.,2108,929,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really like this anime alot and is really sucks that this is the final season :'    ( so the only way i will be satifed with the ending if they finally get married if they dont i will be very disapointed like the ending of 5cm per second,2109,930,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Zero no Tsukaima F (season 4) has the same problems Princess no Rondo (season 3) had. The plot's boring and the character development is regressive. If I ever recommend this series to someone I'll suggest they don't bother with season 3 or 4.,2111,932,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really liked this anime the first episode was just plain boring but the episodes after that was really funny I Liked the character how they had their own unique personalities and how the anime was pretty much IN HELL how many anime have you seen take place in hell.,2112,933,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Be-Boy Kidnapp'n Idol was very good but the ending was although sweet slightly unclear and confusing. I had thought it was going to be boring and a bit lame But it did prove my wrong! Although i have seen better animes this one was certainly brilliant and not a waste of time watching.,2114,935,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Nausicaa of the valley of the wind is a very compelling movie set in a post-acopalyptic world meant to represent the earth in its future. It tells the story of a young princess from the valley of the wind who tries to save mankind from their potential extinction. In the world she lives in the earth is turned into a giant wasteland where the majority of the land has become what seem slike and endless desert. The rest of the land is more or less covered in a toxic jungle where only insects can live as normale due to their resistance to the toxic spores and the polluted air which exists in and a far hundred if not thousands of meters above it. The sea and a number of lakes in the dessert and in the jungle still exists. Though of the water is polluted and is dangerous to humans so they use wells as a primary water source as water far under the earth cant be reached from the toxins.,2119,939,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I never really liked this anime. I just thought it always bored me to tears. Although there are some happy and sad scenes which make you smile and maybe come into tears if you had a death of a loved one but I hated this anime. I think it also might be as bad as Porco Rosso because I watched a little bit of it at my cousins' house and I wasn't interested. But I don't want to review it right now I usually review things I've seen.,2120,940,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really want to give this anime a higher rating but compared to the original manga it lacks the depth and textual feel of the world Miyazaki had created.

Maken-ki is one of those harem animes with a lot of echi moments and a bit of story but what makes maken-ki differant from the others is it has a likeble protagonist who seems like the normal pervy character but is also a total badass which is shown in quite a lot of scenes. There is not to say bout this anime other than it has a interesting anime and if you like echi anime then you will enjoy this and also the action scenes arnt too bad.,2129,949,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Animation is fine. People who like eechi harem fan service can surely opt for this. Story is not that much strong but since the manga is still on-going therefore i hope some good twist will come in near future. Character design is good but not the best. Not recommended to below 18 age groups. ,2130,950,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,2134,954,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Carefree funny and heartfelt Hanamaru Youchien is more than alice-of-life comedy about kindergarteners and their lovable antics.t's also about keeping the child in your heart alive. It's aboutnderstanding that kids even the youngest of them all have littleearts and lots of love in them. The interactions between the teachers the teachers and students andhe teachers and parents are all very funny but completely within theealm of believability. The series touches on growing upalling in love and persevering through tough times while never gettingoo serious.,2135,955,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Loved it. It was just silly fun. There was no real point but be cutend funny. I'm just assuming that there is going to be a sequel. It justnds without resolving any of the problems. Mainly they did what a lotf harem animes love to do.,2136,956,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When I was about to start my first teaching job I really wanted to get inspired by watching an anime series.  I found this one.  It was very cute.  There's not much action but it is quite humorous and sweet.  I got great classroom-decorating ideas from this show and it was nice to have a main character I could really relate to - probably moreso than any other character I'd seen on an anime series before simply because he was a first year teacher as well and didn't really have a clue what he was doing.,2137,957,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,2138,958,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I liked this anime a lot. The characters were so cute! The stories were funny and overall it was pretty much the same as the manga (which I'm reading and is still ongoing). The chibi like children where really cute I loved their attitude and expressions. Hii-chan is a little to intelligent but that's just cute. I like the children drawing what they want to be when they grow up (has anyone noticed the super sentai hints too?) especially Koume's dreams getting mixed up until it's one big mess and she starts crying. It was also nicce the ending theme was different every episode.,2139,959,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I actually wrote this article after watching the first 20 minutes or so of Eureka Seven: Pocketful of Rainbows giving it a scathing review. However after finishing the movie I have a much more favorable disposition towards the movie and decided to rewrite this review.,2140,960,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay so for starters if you go into this thinking that it's a movie with a plot that takes place after the story in the tv series or it's a movie that basically tells the same story all over again but much shorter with some new scenes thrown in then you would be wrong.  This movie is something of an alternate retelling of the story with some rather big changes in not only the story but the characters as well.  People who were enemies in the tv series now take on completely different roles.  So that was just a warning.  If you completely loved the story from the tv series then you many still like the story for the movie but you're just as likely to completely hate it.  The story by itself and treated as somewhat of a seperate entity from the tv series is actually quite enjoyable.  The action was nice and very well animated and even if the story at times became somewhat confusing it was still overall a fairly enjoyable experience.  Really the movie is probably a must see for anyone who watched the tv series and enjoyed it and for those who haven't seen the tv series yet.  It would probably be best if you watched that first since the movie moves fairly fast and some things aren't fully explained in the movie.  Though watching the tv series first is actually what led to some of the complaints I had about the movie but still nevertheless watch the movie if you find yourself having a couple hours of spare time one afternoon.,2144,964,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I wish you could put a value over 10 for the animation in this movie because DAYUM. Some of the best fighting sequences I have EVER seen and hands down the highest quality consistent animation I've seen in a while. Definitely one of my top favourite movies of all time animation or not. Also I appreciated the unique integration of Chinese and Japanese with the voice acting. Amazing!!!,2146,966,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,2147,967,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,2148,968,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So based on a much larger and probably better manga version Sword of the Stranger brings us great animation with fluid battles great coreography and nicely done backgrounds. After all the animation was done by BONES. And BONES knows it's animation. But... It's a BONES anime. This means it often relies on exterior and just that. And this is one of the best textbook examples of a shallow empty exterior. Set in kendo era Japan it follows... A guy with a sword. I can't really say anything else about him. He is just and only a kind heart swordsman. It's not bad that he is kind hearted and all that but come on! I can't give him any other characteristics. He doesn't develop doesn't have any personality isn't interesting to watch. Next we have the child. Who again is just that. A child. Nothing else to describe him. An angry kid who is here for you to say ''AWWWW LIEK IF IT MADE U CRY EVERY TIME''. He has lived through a tragedy. And it's where any resemblance with an actual character end. After the kid we get the villain. Who wants to fight the strongest enemy. And that he does and doesn't do anything else it's the only thing I can say about him. The story like the characters is simple to the point of nothing interesting going on. The kid does something wrong. He is chased by some evil people. He is saved. Than kidnapped again. Than they want to do him more harm. Than he is saved. And than it ends.,2150,969,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,2152,971,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The movies I had watched previously were often connected to a excisting TV show they were never as good as the series itself. The movies were usually additions to the series or some filler material. And the few stand alone movies Ive seen werent that good either in my opinion mostly because it is hard to fit a story as good as a TV show into a movie of merely 2 hours. So I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It still doesnt have a top notch story it is rather cliché and lacks dept but the movie grabs your attention from the very first minute and doesnt let you go till the movie has ended.,2153,972,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Let me start off by saying that I'm not the type of person that typically writes or reads reviews however after watching Sword of the Stranger I felt compelled to share my thoughts with you - the person reading this review. Looking at the ratings I gave each category of the film you might think that this movie is your run of the mill action flick but there is more to this story than just the numbers.,2159,978,2019-04-13 21:35:39

OK so as you can see this got a 10/10. I know most everyone does not like this anime but this is very good. I find it a darker type of anime.,2166,984,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I’m going to cut to the chase; Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom (Phantom henceforth) is not anything exceptional.  Still I think Phantom is a solid show.  The thing with Phantom is that it doesn’t have any glaring weaknesses like Attack on Titan however it does fall short in a lot of important areas as well.  Let’s break it down:,2167,985,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Phantom:Requiem for the Phantom was a pretty good anime. It had a lot of nice action scenes. The characters were unique none of them too stereotypical. And there was a pretty good plot development in the beginning at least. Though I feel like they should've ended the show at episode 19 and just made a 2nd season instead they tried to cram a 2nd season worth of plot into only 6 episodes making the ending feel wrong and rushed. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but the last episode left me extremely unsatisfied. ,2168,986,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,2169,987,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is actually a tough one. Sometimes I wasnt even sure myself if i like it or im bored by it. ,2170,988,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First let me start off by saying that this anime left me with very mixed feelings. On one hand I really liked the story. People complaining about the progressions seem to be complete morons as everytime there was a time skip there was a purpose in it and you could clearly see how the time in between events affected the characters,2171,989,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok this will be my first review of a anime on here.  I do not know if anyone will ready this but this is my opinion.  First I would like to say I love beetrain works but this one was just way way off.  This anime had the same feel of Madlax to the letter.  However this anime had no emotion to I mean it did but it didnt.  What I mean is that they tried to pass the emotion on to the viewer but it never gets there.  The story was lacking a point the characters were also lacking in just basic emotions.  To be honest when I watched I had no emotion towards this anime.  It was sad nor happy and to be honest it could have used some more work.  It was worth the watch however and it was something to say that I watched but in the end all it did was confuse the hell out of me.  The ending as well I mean what the hell.  That is why it was lacking also clarity I was not confused about the story or the plot but it had no sense in the ending.  Oh well in any case watch don't watch it this is just one anime that was a good watch and at the same time bad.,2172,990,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I liked the story line and all of the characters right from the beggining when you weren't even sure what was going on it was really interest and different. In the middle of the anime when Zwei becomes the phantom and Cel is introduced i feel that the storyline degrades a bit and is not so good I would definately reccomend watching it all the way through and i was really happy with the anime until the  6 months later part  of the last episode. The last minute I wanted to kill the writers and cry at the same time. I hated the ending. I think it ruined a good anime the fact that it happened for no reason.,2173,991,2019-04-13 21:35:39
this was a nice anime but i missed it a littler in the end.,2174,992,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2175,993,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,2176,994,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I got into this series after I had finished Darker Than Black and I was a little skeptical when I started this. Now that I have finished all 26 episodes of this amazing series I consider it one of the best 8 hours and 40 minutes I have ever spent with an anime series. The story is one of the most well written I have seen in a while. Reijis character was very compelling and I loved Eren. Cal I am a little bit in between on. On one hand she was a very cute child and on the other she was a very scary Phantom. For those of you who have not seen the series I will not spoil any plot details but I must warn you that the ending is very ambiguous and although I understood the meaning of it perfectly I dont know if anyone else would. This anime is very dark for those of you considering it but if you can stand a show with very little humor in it you will love the hell out of this series. The first opening theme  KARMA  by Kokia made its way onto my all time anime theme favorites list as well as the 2nd ending theme  Transparent  by the same artist. Musically this series was given one of the best scores ever written for an anime series. It almost sounds like you are listening to a concert hall performance with visuals. Every single note fits each scene perfectly and invokes the right emotions. The animation quality was very top notch on par with  D Gray Man . Overall if you like dark anime well written plot lines and a great musical score in your anime give this one a try. Just dont expect to like the ending.,2178,995,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime had a great start with alot of action and fighting. It gives off this intense feeling when watching it and I'm happy with the pair of main character that was given in lead. The animation of this anime is well drawn but i think the plot started to go downhill after Eren the girl phatom disappear after she's been shot but stablize itself when she's been discovered again. I didn't like the idea that they were put into a brother and sister relationship and that he started to date someone else in his school. To be perfectly honest it bothers me that they arn't couples because they look like the perfect pair together. I was reading the reviews for this anime while watching it and i can see many people complaining about the ending which made me look forward to it. I can say I truely agree with the people's complain because it's really confusing and like a WTF?! moment. I also did alot of skipping scenes in this anime because there's alot of conversation going on in between but overall i still agree that's it's a great anime regardless which will be worth your time.,2179,996,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Okay first I am going to say (Excuse my language...) the ending to this show was fucked up!!! Now to the recap from the beginning. The description basically tells you how he came to be an assassin which was because he had his memories erased and was chosen to live in this twisted kill or be killed world. The girl who trains him Ein (Means the #1 in I think german) has already been devoid of emotion and is training him to be a heartless killer as well. Zwei/Reiji has a pretty easy time sliding into that lifestyle despite his hate for killing.,2180,997,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The anime itself is really good but really dark. It will mess with the head and the heart on a very deep and dark level. Other than the last three episodes inwhich everything goes to complete and total shit it is a decent anime very much like Black Lagoon or others of similar nature.,2181,998,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Phantom: Requiem for a Phantom: Season 1 Review,2182,999,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really really liked this show. Good characters and story. It was pretty sad at times. I love shows that bring up your emotions. The ending was actually pretty good. It did not make much sense but you had to figure it out.,2183,1000,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is depressing.  All the characters are in really sad situations and the show manages to protray their subsequent morally abominable actions without making the characters seem abominable.  They all had reasons for acting the way they did and they were all interesting.  Unfortunately however one of the characters' changed drastically in the middle of the show and I don't think her motivations were explored sufficiently; there were tons of scenes with that character acting crazily yet I felt those scenes merely created drama rather than adding depth to that character.  Spoiler alert: I'm referring to Cal.  We hear about her feelings and we infer the causes of those feelings but I feel the creators would have been better served showing her motivations in more detail.,2185,1,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,2186,2,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Just like its name Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~ is a convolutedess. It’s only by a great feat of skill or luck that it avoids being aomplete disaster.,2187,3,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I see a few low reviews for this anime which saddens me quite a bit. When I sat down to write this review I really couldn't think of anything bad to say about it. But for the sake of my rating system I can't quite give it a 10/10 though in my heart I feel it deserves it. Any who...,2188,4,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It has been a while since i watched an anime that i felt was worth alog post/mini-review. I had remembered hearing about this show when itirst aired in 2007 as the sleeper series of the year. I now understandhy that is. The setup for the series is a bit longer than normal for a 24 episode show. You don't really start hitting the meat of the storyntil about 7 episodes in. The animation is nice but the powers arehown in a rather simplistic way. I think that this is to the seriesenefit as the focus of the series is the story telling and theharacters. The powers are just some extra awesomeness sprinkled onop. This is one of the only space opera animes that i have watched.he only other one that i can think of would be banner of the starts.his anime has really gotten me thinking of watching Legend of thealactic Heroes though king of the space opera anime.,2195,10,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series begins in what appears to be a ratheristurbing dystopia set on a terraformed world far from Earth. Jomy is atudent on this world and is about to take the examination for adulthood butate has a different plan in store. This was a very powerful series that touchedn a multitude of philosophical issues and drew on numerous science fictionhemes.,2198,12,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Nabari no Ou is one of my favorite animes and it always will be. The characters are great the story had a lot of turns and suprises and the animation was the best i've seen from an anime made in 2008. I never get tired of watching it and almost all of the episodes has some sort of suspense coming from it. ,2202,16,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Grows on You,2203,17,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was a good anime. The characters were believable the voice acting was good and it wasn't too predictable. The style wasn't distorted too much with the exception of Miharu having legs that were half the size of his already skinny arms at times. The soundtrack was really good and I liked the voices. It diverges from the manga but you should be accustomed to that if you're an anime fan.,2204,18,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2205,19,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime was the best anime that did not even need any romance added to it. I loved the way miharu was strong willed and did not waver in his conviction to help Yoite. I love how in the beginning Miharu agreed to Yoites request because of the threat but then how it developed into a loving friend relationship. I cried when Yoite turned into a stream of glittering dust and floated off into the air but just loved the fact that he disappeared with a smile in his face.,2206,20,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a really good anime. I don't usually like ninjas and sword fights and similar stuff but in this case the anime isn't about ninjas and fighting just for the sake of it they're elements of the plot that make up the backdrop for the characters to interact develop and shine. This anime is all about the characters. ,2209,23,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is pure garbage it has potential and proceeds to squander it many things don't make any sense and the ending is pretty weak too. :),2210,24,2019-04-13 21:35:39
WARNING: This review contains some mild spoilers.,2211,25,2019-04-13 21:35:39
LOVE The anime...yup the plot was great and somewhat unexpected as they kind of live happily ever after. The ending was splendid and indeed heartwarming although i do wish for yeito to survive or at least died having his body remained. ^_^. As for the overall plot i really like how they pull out the logical of having your past and future related..when yeito made the decision to stay as he is it make sense to me because it is true when he says that the past have made him who he is 'the current' he. That by staying the same way as he is he would get the love of those who truly treasured and care for him endlessly. The concept of forgive and forget are somewhat things that we can learn for our living..yup the mosr earnest way of living is to forgive ppl mistake and somehow forget bout it because obviously personal desire and revenge seeking does not do bring anything other than regret and suffer. ,2212,26,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series felt weak and watery to me. (If you read my reviews I often use the term watery. I mean it's like a watered down glass of orange juice. It's not strong and it's not as good as a normal glass.) ,2214,28,2019-04-13 21:35:39

One thing I think I should point out before I start my review of this anime is that the manga's creator Gokurakuin Sakurako is actually a woman. Her name is really Ashika Sakura and she has done yaoi manga with titles like Sensative Pornograph.,2221,35,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sekirei is fairly original.  Though I suppose the plot somewhat resembles other anime like  East of Eden  in that several participants are forced to play in a life or death type of game.  The overly offensive use of girl bit flashes and situations aside it is not to bad a show.  There are plenty of action scenes and each of the players' attatched alien-esque mostly female warriors have different types of skills and at different levels.  it should be no surprise that many participants actually want no part in such a farce of a game.  That is a rather nice realistic approach slightly different from your usual anime framework.  Of course this sort of sets a kind of tone and pace among at least the major protagonists where they either reveal some guilt or reluctance or avoid violence or at least deeply struggly internally  over the question of  is playing this game even right .  True maybe alot of animes love to dance on the edge of the grey areas of many questions such as those of morality and often cross them into oddball areas but this one at least raises the issue of morality and rightly shows that not everyone is a willing pawn to so called destinies albiet very violent at that in this case.  Often however I have to wonder what use or purpose do so called controllers really have in this game?  In this sense it somewhat mimics other animes with simllar character inter-relations such as  Rozen Maiden  and  Fate/Zero .  The interactions between the girl warriors is often quite amusing which may help organize the shows characters so that even if they fade at times a bit here and there they are not at times forgotten like well the X-Men movies.  It also often either brings up or aids new story arcs or plots or contributes to the outcome of others started elsewhere.  You see a few rivals of sorts make repeat appearances.  Now and then there are even a few plot surprises which are usually welcome if not thrown at us viewers completely out of the blue with nothing to suggest it's possibility even.  ,2223,37,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: Minato has just failed his college entrance exam for the second time establishing that he really has not a lot going on in his life when by fate a girl literally falls out of the sky introducing us to Sekirei and the story: Sekirei are 108 intergalactic beings discovered by the head of a generic Conglomerate known as MBI who for reasons unknown to us decides to use these beings in a game known as the Sekirei Plan where each has to fight the other until the last sekirei is standing and whose reward is to be able to spend eternity with her/his Ashikabi. As much as the idea of the story pulls me in this is where it falls on it's face. While these creatures feel they must fight each other no one ever seems to be in any real danger unless the main characters are fighting for a reason (i.e. helping another Sekirei and her Ashikabi escape the city) but it is during these confrontations that small glimmers of  Something else is going on that we are not aware of  appear.,2227,41,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love this anime!!! Not only does it have an interesting plot but the charecters are absolutley funny and great with each of their individual qualties.. I wish the Anime- planet people add their second season.. There most deffinatley is one and it;s dubbed as well as the first one. WARNING!!!! If you are uncomfortable with nudity DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME!! Nudity makes a frequent appearance but i ignore that and stay with the story.,2228,42,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sekirei is about a boy Minato Sahashi with above average intelligence at school but failed to get into a university two years running. While taking a walk to decide his future a mysterious girl Musubi falls out of the sky and lands on him. Musubi is being pursued by two other women with the ability to control lightning. After helping her escape Minato becomes her Ashikabi and his life will never be the same.,2229,43,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"Minato Sahashi has failed the college entrance exam twice but hisife takes a lucky turn when a buxom girl falls out of the sky and lands onim...This ecchi comedy really was a great story with high-power anime actionnd harem mayhem and a dash of mystery in the blend to keep it interesting. ",2230,44,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sekirei is a really stupid anime to most people. It is an ecchi harem romance with allot of action. However out of every harem i have ever seen this one by far has the best characters. This anime was one of the first i have ever watched so even though there are many who would not like this show i love it. I feel like this is one of those hidden gem shows that gets way to covered in tits and ass. Does it have that yes but it isn't the only point of the show. So check it out you may like it. The story is about a young man named....,2231,45,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I think its great I love the plot am a huge fan of survil game tyoe animes cant wait to see how it ends if are a fan of this highley recomend reading the manga,2232,46,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This special episode of Another was released in the manga after the original story so I watched it after watching the main series and I recommend others do the same even though it is given an episode number before the first episode of the series. This prequel story is set in a timeline just before the series begins and the episode ends where the series starts.,2233,47,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,2234,48,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Gorgeous addition to the show. It was super sad and lovely. I think I loved this episode more than the show. It was a perfect add on a behind the scenes look into Mei's background before the terrible day her sister passed...honestly if they would have went into some other character backgrounds on the show or even implemented this one in as an episode during it would have given the show much more life. I understand Mei much more now.,2235,49,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Making sequels is a fickle thing. It's vary similar to owning aouse. Once you've bought said house  you have two waysf going about doing what you wish for the house: 1# you could put inice furniture a new paint job clean up the attic just make itetter then it was or #2 you can do an entire overhaul on the damnhing make the roof look like a chicken coop put in new rooms thatook tacky as hell on the outside put a statue outside of a littleoy peeing into a waterfall which will probably not go well with theeighborhood watch basically go hog wild on the place.

The only reason to watch this is because you enjoyed the original and want more stylish badass action violence and more style. Come in with the same expectations as the first and you'll most likely enjoy it all the same. Expect more than that and the flaws will glare back at you in distain as you would do to them.,2251,62,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a really good show they have a really good show i dont get why did not make another season i mean it was a good anime most of the people i know are mad cause its so short,2252,63,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: ,2253,64,2019-04-13 21:35:39
While the story didn't do anything new from other ecchi anime's i still rather enjoyed the story. First we get to know immidietly why our dense protagonist is as good as he is something hardly any other animes would bother to tell us. There again the Duo bringing in the problems for mister protagonist seems to be a rather...eh... Overpowered couple as they just seems to take down every and survive every and you because... still have massive amount of freetime.,2254,65,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-Kun (My heartfelt sympathy Ninomiya-kun) is a 12 episode ecchi harem anime. Be warned I do hate the ecchi/harem genres so take heed of my words. Shungo Ninomiya is an extraordinary teenager who gets into the situation of looking after an androphobic (fear of males) succubus. Instant fail. And I've seen this type of story before. Not to mention she wants to fall in love but if she gets intimate the guy will die. It goes without saying I was drinking for this anime. No way I'd watch this sober.,2257,68,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I won't have a summary of what happened because the other reviews do but all I can say is that this video was heart-wrenching depressing and jut plain awful to me. I have three basset hounds so watching this made me need to hug each one just to let them know they're loved. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone because i put me in a really melancholy mood...,2264,75,2019-04-13 21:35:39

as a nerd i love Batman as a otaku i love anime when you bring these two things together you get Batman Gotham Knight now as i watched this i was saying to myself what if this is like Dragon Ball Evolution well it was not Dragon Ball Evolution (note: every time you hear THAT MOVIE a DBZ Fan Die) but any way to Batman it became a Scott Pilgirm anime how? you would ask well let me tell you the beginning i hated the beginning the animation look like shit just like Paranoia Agent now i hate it and also HATE the animation to it hell i hate everything about but i am ranting back to batman so the first 15 minutes really sucked but then when the 15 minutes are up the awesome of batman begins i will not spoil the rest of it but the only cool thing is this they got the voice from the 1999 Batman voice actor to do this batman witch is awesome but they also got robin from teen titans voice actor to do a regular boy for the first 15 minute a small role but still good,2268,79,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Show by Rock!! did an excellent job at what it set out to do. As someone who plays the original mobile game daily I feel that it made an excellent portrayal of the contents of the game without expecting you to already have played it. However it felt a bit rushed although I realize it is difficult to create a cohesive story and universe in such a short series.,2272,81,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story line of this anime was okay although throughout this anime the development was rushed. It isn't realistic (in my mind) that Cyan would only have to increase her experience ( through the crystal in chest ) by having a few shows with the band. I feel to make this anime better adding a few more original songs and rock battles could have helped to fill in the empty story line.,2273,82,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So this is kind of an embarrassing show to admit that I like. There isn't really much to the characters. The girls are all cute and the guys are mostly comic relief.,2274,83,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Even though I rated this pretty low when it came to story the story is actually what drew me in...at first. It was a fairly unique and truly absurd which is right up my ally.,2280,89,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Assassination Classroom is another new popular anime. I first saw it listed as top anime on one of my anime pages and thought  yeah why don't watch it without even knowing what it's about  It turned out to be hella funny and even though the idea of this story is totally  absurd it has some meaningful message behind it. ,2281,90,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Full disclosure:  I’m solidly in the Team Ayeka camp but that’s not why I don’t like this movie.,2286,95,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A pretty good movie I guess. It did not feel like a Tenchi Muyo at all. Tenchi Muyo used to have a lot of humor and action. It wasn't something to be taken seriously. It was like they wanted to change that in this movie. There was very little humor and no action. Even the characters felt like they had less energy in them. Of the three movies it somehow had the best story even though it was the basic story throughout all the movies.,2287,96,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The anime itself is full of flaws; however if you take into consideration its' hilarious awareness of its' own absurdity then the anime is much more enjoyable. I recomend to watch it in one setting and do consider taking it with a grain of salt. Overall more of a couch anime then anything.,2294,103,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well this anime is about vampires (obviously) but Blood Lad isn't like the others. I mean it's very funny and isn't creepy. You enjoy the characters and the plot is interesting. If you like funny animes you should watch it :D,2298,104,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Blood lad had a bit of everything. Awesome fights a completely dorky yet awesome vampire (Staz) with amazing powers which we don’t get to see the full extent of until towards the end but he's got the most wonderful sarcastic dorky personality in the world so it's okay. Some of the characters seem to have love hate relationships which makes everything even more amusing. It's funny; all the other anime/manga reference especially to goku had me giggling. The poor ghost girl has her work cut out for her trying to get herself back into her body with the help she gathers. Werewolves vampires and various other shape shifters oh my. The story was good from beginning to end (which was open ended and left room for another season which I hope they make). I highly recommend this whether you are looking for awesome fight scenes or humor. It touches on most categories (minor love interest but not the main selling point so don’t worry it isn't overly mushy). All in all a good watch.,2299,105,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,2300,106,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story was sound but nothing truly groundbreaking it was well paced and well done. The animation was quite fun and it matched well with the style of anime but their were a few moments where some of the animation just did not seem right. The sound was fun for the anime and the closing I was not a fan of the opening theme as it seemed more distracting and flashy then a proper opening. The Characters while very well done seemed to be the same types that are in most series out there. I did quite enjoy some of the characters that were introduced later in the series and then just seemed to get minor develpoment. Overall it was a fun anime to watch and a good interim anime to watch between large and longer series.  ,2301,107,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Blood Lad is an anime that is not a masterpiece nor a pile of discarded crap. The vampire genre has been medled with by Hollywood so now everything to do with vampires makes us think of twilight. But every once in while we see this genre that is used to create anime and manga such as Dance in the Vampire Bund or Blood Lad.,2302,108,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Medabots is not a unique anime anyone heard of pokemon digimon etc! But i really Medabots so much i watched it twice. The story is just good. To bad the sequel is not that good.,2308,114,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Medabots is an excellent anime that produces more than what most people would expect when looking at it. The characters are amazing and hilarious with humor that is much different than what I normally see in anime. Medabots was able to grow its characters perfectly along with the story making a perfect set up for later in the series when the plot picks up. The only two negatives I have for this series is the animation which seems somewhat sub-par and the ending was atrocious definitely not how I thought it should have ended. But everything else makes up for it in my eyes. The characters and the story until the end were very fulfilling. This will always be one of my favorite animes.,2309,115,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Full Metal Panic seems like a pretty good series... adequate action throughout appropriate music and good animation. The last episode felt right for the rest of the series. It was a great series and I recommend it to anyone who likes mecha series.,2313,119,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show surprised me in the fact it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The story though sometimes lacking was actually pretty entertaining and kept me watching from start to finish. The series runs pretty short being that there are 24 episodes to its original so it doesn't take very long to watch at all. The animation was really well done and the voice acting (for the dub) was actually pretty good compaired to some other shows I've watched dubbed. All in all it was a short but cute series and I enjoyed it. ,2314,120,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story - It was not a bad story. I just wasn't amazing. It had two storys going on at once. The whole school life was funny with Souske paranoia and trying to protect Chidori. It was my favorite part and wish it would have lasted longer. The millitary story was good to I just wish there was more school then millitary. It was a really exciting and enjoyable series and one of my favorites.,2315,121,2019-04-13 21:35:39

FMP is an awesome series. The series mixes in the right amount of action and drama so that the episodes doesn't feel like repeats unlike some series. The characters have personality and the main characters are shown to develop as the story goes on. Souske is one of my favorite characters. There are a lot of bullets and some blood. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes mecha with some drama.,2318,124,2019-04-13 21:35:39

There was alot of times I found myself smiling at the events unfolding and other times I found myself getting aggravated that some of the characters were so ignorant. All in all I found myself enjoying this show and would recomend it to about anyone. Though coming from someone who was a huge gundam fan I loved it even more.,2322,127,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It’s a good thing this review is only over the first season of FMP! otherwise its rating would be much lower and the review overall would be a lot more negative. But onward we go! Honestly I could not stop watching this series when I first started it. The first oh six or seven episodes are extremely intriguing and really introduce the characters and story line well. The problem I think other viewers may run into is that it’s not a serious mecha anime. If the creators meant for it to be that way they failed drastically and if you go into expecting epic battles and mind blowing logistics around every corner you’re going to be severely disappointed.,2328,132,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The STORY of Full Metal Panic!  is very interesting.  A man named Sousuke - who's part of  an anti-terrorist group called Mithril - must go to a high school to protect a young high school student named Chidori due to her being one of the  whispered .  That is she possesses knowledge of an advanced technology called  black technology  that everyone is trying to get their hands on.  This could have been a fantastic plot had it been presented better but the anime did a poor job.,2329,133,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,2330,134,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is an epic work of art.  Everything about how this is drawn and animated is just amazing.  The figurative story requires critical thought and you take away as much as you put in.  I wish there were more people that appreciate how truly awesome this is. ,2331,135,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is the first Gundam series; the one that started it all and personally my favorite. It of course is a mecha anime but the first of it's kind: robots can run out of ammo or fuel the heroes can sometimes lose and long distances don't get traveled in the blink of an eye. This seems commonplace for a mecha anime of today but for 1979 it was groundbreaking. But how well does it hold up now? ,2342,146,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Gundam is a landmark. Nothing more. That being said a landmark is a pretty big statement in it's own right. While the first run of Gundam was unsuccessful the compilation movies did wonders for the series and a japanese phenomenon launched into orbit (lame gundam pun count: 1). So if the first series was a bomb why is it still being watched and loved today? Well that's why I'm here.,2343,147,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Famously the Turing Test is the way to measure if an artificial intelligence is on par with a human one. The premise is simple: if experts cannot distinguish between an AI and a person in conversation is there any meaningful difference in the interaction between them? Does that not mean that the AI is human enough for the difference to be irrelevant?,2355,158,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Eve no Jikan revolves around the timeless question of whether androids could ever possibly have any form of emotions.  With the story for the most part taking place within a secret cafe involving a cast made up of both andriods and humans.  Though Eve no Jikan does a wonderous job in blurring the line between them to such a degree that it becomes almost impossible to actually tell them apart.  Though the overall theme in Eve no Jikan as been explored before in other forms such as the movie IRobot or Bicentennial Man but instead as following the exact same course that either of those movies followed Eve no Jikan instead tends to focus a bit more on societies reaction to andriods with emotions.,2356,159,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Every once in a while you find a gem among all those stones that just shines so much brighter. Eve no Jikan is such a work and I'm SO happy I watched it. This show offers a lot more than you'd expect and I would suggest repeated viewings to dig out all the little bits.,2357,160,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Eve no Jikan (AKA Time of Eve) is a 6 episode (15 minutes each) sci-fi drama anime set in the future about androids and the line drawn between what is human and what isn’t. This is a common theme in fiction where robots are a key focus and much like other sci-fi about robots the world here adheres to Asimov’s laws of Robotics. The title refers to a café of the same name where humans and robots are indistinguishable. It has a unique appeal since right off the bat this is no ordinary anime. I can tell that this won’t be everybody’s cup of tea but those who like unique anime and don’t like the usual type of anime might enjoy this.,2361,163,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Origins: Spirits of the Past is set in a post-apocalyptic world where DNA-altered plants have totally taken control of the world. It is about a boy called Agito who lives in a settlement where the inhabitants lives under the rules of the forest an entity which represesents the nature and is literally a forest. One day Agito stumbles upon a great machine from the past carrying a girl who has been frozen down. Agito accidently unfreezes her resulting in that she wakes up only to see what have become of the future. Agito befriends her and tries to convince her to learn to live in the new future though she is soon greeted by another man from the same time as she is named Shunack. Shunack convinces her to join him in undoing the result of what seemed to be a failed experiment to restore eco-system that the humans had ruined in the past. Seeking to know more and a wish to return the world to normal she accepts his invitation. Which forces Agito to make a pact with the nature...,2371,173,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I like the post-apocalyptic genre and thats why the story got a 6. I really disliked the story-line. I wanted the world to return to it's former self the whole movie. I mean seriously who wants a world where humans are ruled by trees... I know I sure don't.,2372,174,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I've recently decided to expand my list of anime movies watched and unfortunately I've come to realize that anime movies may not be the best idea. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of anime movies that kick ass and for the most part if the movie is in conjunction with a series it tends to do better in my eyes however this anime movie fell prey to what I like to call Cram and Suck Syndrome.,2377,179,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Yes this movie is completely recap from the anime. No I did not find anything truly new about the movie. However the movie seemed fresh and overall more enjoyable than the anime. Now this could partially be due to the fact that I was able to piece the story together better since it was a retelling. I for one loved the anime and enjoyed seeing the story yet again. ,2385,186,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is just more of the tv series. Randomness Hilarity and Fanservice! Actually if anything I would say this is better then the TV series It's slightly more funny about the same randomness and has 4x the fanservice! By 4x I mean that it is 4x more intense :D. Also there is a TWIST ENDING! There actually is believe it or not though its not serious. Anyways bottom line is if you liked Pani Poni Dash you will love this and if you loved Pani Poni Dash you will have an orgasm over this.,2390,191,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I just recently finish watching this anime and I must say this was a really great anime  the plot was amazing  the music i wished that they changed the opening theme song not just the ending theme. I really couldnt stop watching this anime it was that good  i had to be told to stop to eat something lol . I just wish that they made more  did FonFon ever go back to his home city  what happen to the guy who left his heaven blade or what happen to the queens daughter . So many questions left unanswers.

Great action and charater development not to much romance but enough to keep it interesting. Main character is not overpowerd and has good flaws.

With a score of 6/10 don't think that this anime is not worth watching. The pace of this anime interlinked with a someone innovative and refreshing story line makes it a great anime to watch if you're looking for a small sized anime. I personally watched this whilst watching both Bleach and Naruto and I found it to be both entertaining and interesting.,2406,206,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm really torn when writing this review. I feel like this anime could be absolutely amazing because it is and yet it isn't. For starters it needs to have about 50 more episodes. I feel like the creators intended a very long series and had to wrap everything up very quickly.,2409,209,2019-04-13 21:35:39

When i started watching Chrome Shelled Regios or Koukaku no Regios I was highly anticipatingan excellent story of well made science fiction according to the coments I read. What I got was an absolute feast......of mediocrity. Here is the reason why I finally dropped this series. I couldn't stand it much longer after 10 episodes ( it gave me some sort of nausea to think there is still half the series unwtached but seriously enough wasting my time on this horrible series). You may call my review biaised but I don't give a damn. Enough of this ****.,2411,211,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Right I'm going to pull out my dart rifle and shoot the elephant in the room right away. Anyone who came here hoping for some lesbian action will most likely be disappointed the most intimate thing Haruka and Michiru do is hold hands indoors (fully clothed). Anyone who decided that watching this anime would somehow do something for the gay movement will also be disappointed because in one episode the other Senshi (apart from Haruka and Michiru) suspect that Jupiter is a lesbian becuase of her hero worship of Haruka with 2 or 3 saying that that would be a bad thing. At no point did any character say anything else about homosexuality in this show whether pro or anti so on balance the show actually looks(only looks mind) anti-homosexuality especially given that in the first season of Sailor Moon 2 of the Shitenoh (Beryl's 4 mainly useless generals) were gay and in the S movie they wonder if Mamoru is gay with again nobody saying anything about homosexuality one way or another (in both the movie and show Mercury was adamant that neither Jupiter nor Mamoru were gay and being the brainy one* she was right) and finally I read an interview Naoko Takeuchi (she wrote the manga in case you forgot) did that Haruka and Michiru's relationship was one of friendship that became love and that these things happen (becuase young children wouldn't have understood how 2 girls could be in love with one another she made Haruka a butch lesbian that is one who acts like a man Usagi even seemed to be in love with her when she smelled her cologne with Michiru being a lipstick that is girly girl lesbian though nowadays in the west the girly thing to do seems to be to try to be all strong but overdoing it I presume by accident and ending up being mean) and she didn't say whether she was OK with homosexuality or against it so I'm not saying the Sailor Moon franchise is anti-gay or pro-gay just that it's one of the few things on this Earth that contains homosexuality but isn't about homosexuality it's a part of the work but not a part of its premise and isn't there to make a political point. I've typed this before and I can't stress it enough that I'm against people bringing up their views into anime discussions where they don't have a place. Sure you can bring up your views into anime with messages or political viewpoints but it's partisan and out of place to bring them up about anime with no messages or politics but this being the internet this being a review in English (Ireland** was occupied for so long that the Irish language was nearly killed off and I don't live in a Gaeltacht that is an Irish-speaking region) and 2/3 of English speakers on the internet being American (300 million people from majority English-speaking countries use the internet and Americans are 200 million of them yes I actually bothered to check) and America being the most politics obsessed country on the planet (or at least it very much appears that way) and given that shonen-ai and shojo-ai are 2 of my 3 least favourite genres I of course have to give my views on homosexuality lest people think I'm some reactionary fundamentalist homophobe (not likely being from Europe and a young but rural person I think that extremely liberal militant atheist relativists are as bad as the aforementioned reactionaries. In Europe we're not apolitical we just have more moderate views because we've seen firsthand the wreck that both fascism and communism cause while in America the parties argue over what freedom to give social or economic but the people want both so they label one party fascist the other communist and the people take extreme positions to be as different from the party they don't vote for as possible while not being all that keen either on the party they do vote for heck the internet of all places only supported Obama on a lesser evils basis in his 2nd presidential campaign). Sex is nothing more than 2 (or for health and threfore religious reasons alike rules are usually made to acheive results and not to oppress people out of nothing but sadism in spite of what anarachists think God forbid more than 2) people putting 1 or 2 of where their urine or poo comes out in or on the other person and it's only fun so we'd bother and so humanity would continue to inhabit the Earth so there's no way I could possibly be OK with homosexuality though we all have our faults so do unto others... so I don't think it's fair to think of homosexuals as lesser or subhuman and certainly people who rape people for being gay or asexual are far more in the wrong than anyone who is homosexual. I also don't like censorship as it's covering up for the person who commited what the censors supposed was a wrong so for moral reasons I gave up on the dubs of Sailor Moon and on principle I now only watch the subs unless I can't find them. I know I've spent far longer on this section alone then I would on an entire review usually but as aforementioned most people who read this will probably be American and have seen what my least favourite genres are so I had to bear this in mind and discuss in depth my views on the homosexuality in Sailor Moon S and what I feel about homosexuality in general because it did affect my viewing experience I felt tense because of it as opposed to disgusted watching the original Sailor Moon series because being a heterosexual it's only natural that I'll find 2 males in love to not be appealing to say the least though on balance the original series is slightly better though I'm not really sure why. I have marked Haruka and Michiru as hated and it's not just because they're lesbian; it's mainly because they're machiavellians (they don't care who dies even if they're not the enemy even though as Usagi knew nobody had to die unless they were an enemy) and machiavellianism isn't a trait to be appreciated in anyone (which is why I also hate that creep Paul von Oberstein from Legend Of The Galactic Heroes and Treize Khushrenada from Gunam Wing). Machiavellianism is named after Nicolo Macchiavelli a Renaissance Italian politician who wrote that  politics bear no relation to morals  (he is more famously quoted as  the ends justify the means  but what he actually wrote in that sentence was more along the lines of the long term must be taken into account) and so machiavellianism is just doing what you want to get results no matter how small or short term no matter how many people you screw over in the process no matter how badly you screw them over and no matter how much wreck your actions will cause and no matter for how long. So Machiavelli was no worse than the politicians of today in other words.,2415,215,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sailor Moon S is seen by many moonies (Sailor Moon fans) as the besteries of the bunch. There is no denying its greatness and success inaking you feel for the characters. The new characters who become anntegral part of the story are very relatable and well handled and ashe audience has come to expect from Sailor Moon; melodrama is kept inheck for real affecting drama instead. The humour and irony that makeailor Moon so much fun is still present but the mood is much darkerhan any previous Sailor Moon series. This atmosphere will only beatched by Sailor Moon Stars later episodes.,2417,217,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Plot:  In an ancient and mythological land called Saiunkoku the people haveegun to recover from a period of war and famine; thus when anfficial from the imperial court offers the impoverished and beautifulhuurei more money than she could ever dream of in return for a favorhe jumps at the chance. What she doesn’t count on however is beingsked to become a concubine to the recluse Emperor and help himransform into a better leader.

This is another OVA that makes for good riffing material. Essentially the main characters of this show Mai and Santa are rip-offs of Ken Akamatsu's best work Love Hina. (Supposedly this was made by Akamatsu's staff while he was sailing around the world.) He's really lacking a lot that made Keitaro interesting. Keitaro had a goal that being getting into Tokyo U. Santa has no goals in life plus he makes Shinji Ikari look super macho in comparison.,2437,235,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I had read the review about this and vowed never to watch it; however due to a cheap price I picked it up and decided to give it a try.  Although this is not the pinnacle of anime by any means it is a pretty cute little show.  The animation as well as the sound are nothing special but don't detract from it either.  The two main characters Santa and Mai are relatively interesting but are nothing new to Ken Akematsu's work.  The remaining characters are relatively flat but considering that the series is only two episodes long I can forgive this.  Overall I liked this show simply because it did what nothing else could do this year and got me into the Christmas spirit.  It's kind of like an anime version of those old holiday specials (Rudolph Frosty etc.): Not exactly a great plot but still pretty good and it definitely makes you feel some warmth. ,2438,236,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I dont want to be too picky about things but in general I feel Nisekoi is a real drag. The first season was enjoyable because it was different and I thought a new season would make a fresh start and revive it a little bit but It hasnt. since the first episode it doesnt feel refreshing or anything different and it seems completely off topic everywhere. I must say I dont think the 2nd season is worth the watch at all in comparison to the first season. I adored Episode 8 but thats it every other episode had me left with little to no interest and was getting slightly bored and how annoyingly dull this series is actually getting.,2449,247,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"Let me start by saying i hate disaster movies. Films like the posidendventure do nothing but piss me off because of the lack of reltey tohe horrible situation and just making an thriller in disguise as moviebout a real tragedy. Tokyo magnitude 8.0 is different however in theact that it more resembles grave of the firefly's then the posidendventure. The story is quite simple a middle school girl named mariaho hates her family is forced to go to a robot expo with her littlerother lufey in odaiba. Shortly after arriving an 8.0 magnitudearthquake stricks Tokyo and destroys most of the city leaving mariaufey and a female mortercycolist named mari a s they try to get backome to find there family. Tokyo magnitude is both beautiful andealistic. The destruction it Tokyo seems real and horrifying at theame time. Buildings are destroyed and there bodies on the ground andnjured peapole. The animation done by bones is fantastic and trulyaptures the horer and reailesom of the destruction. The characters areore human then you expect from anime. The children do seem like normalhildren maria is a normal preteen girl as well as lufey being a normalittle kid and is also probably the cutest little kid in anime histroy.he series also has a fantastic opining and ending track that through sut the traditional j pop and gives a good hard rock opining theme and happy emotional ending theme. overall tokyo magnitude 8.0 is probablyhe best anime to come out in the summer seasion and besids fmarouther hood the best anime of the year. so i give Tokyo magnitude 8.0 9 out of 10 ",2457,255,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime was a real tear-jerker for me I usually don't watch drama anime but ya know I took a chance. This story is about a little girl and her brother Yuuki who get caught up in an earthquake at a robotics exhibit without their parents. They travel with a girl they meet to reunite with their parents (my episodes got mixed up from the source I watched it from so I saw the end and THEN the beginning :'( ) This is a compelling story basically about them increasing their bond as brother and sister and overcoming trials together. The ending had me literally soaked tears and my eyes are now sore. But anyway if you like really sweet anime that shows an increasing bond between siblings this is the perfect thing! WARNING: The ending is very sad and you probably didn't predict it!!,2466,264,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Do not watch this anime unless you want to end up crying. Beautiful story great characters and it's also rather acurate Japan faces the danger of a large earthquake and the aftermath is close to what would happen in real life. If you like touching stories about survivors in disaster this is a good choice but have a box of tissues and if your like me some chocolate to keep yourself from completely falling apart.,2468,266,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well on a great recommendation from Sothis and pushing of kira to justet it now instead of waiting for a batch. I watched Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 one night one ep after another.

An anime that will make you cry if you get attached to the characters.. it's a school life type anime where brother and sister go through a bunch of problems when an earthquake hits Tokyo and soon after find someone to help them get back home. The anime leaves you on the edge of your seat with random twists in the story it brings new faces every episode.. One to watch if you have some time to kill a great family anime as well.,2475,273,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you thought that the same people who made Wicked City made this then you're wrong but I can't blame you for thinking it. It has pretty much the same problems as Wicked City; constant mindless violence and constant sex derail the plot. The journalist gets raped in the hopes that this would scare her away (awfully minor thing to rape someone over) and you would expect that this would ruin her life and lead her to stay inside and cry all day but no she tags along with the rapist in his adventures. I'm dead serious. This is the worst handling of a sensitive depressing and widespread subject that I have ever seen in an anime. Even worse than in Wicked City. In Wicked City the victim was somehow OK after being raped for hours but she didn't team up with her rapists. In short this is the worst OAV I've ever seen and one of the absolute worst anime of any kind that I have ever seen. ,2482,277,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The Series messed itself up in a big way as it got closer to the end.  You lost its sense of direction and the character building was not working towards a resolution but rather unwinding itself.  the Series tried to be a slice of life but then ended up trying to be something else.  This hurt the series in a big way for me.,2487,282,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This review is dedicated to Justin Carmical (JewWario),2492,287,2019-04-13 21:35:39
An incredible ending to an otherwise brilliant anime. I struggled with the strange release date of the episodes and not knowing about the right order or re-release I thought I would never finish the anime. This movie was breathtaking in both the animation and plot. It takes the themes present in the anime and enhances them ten-fold. You have time-traveling school-life mystery romance drama and the very fabric of the universe being threatened. This movie could not have been a more satisfying end to an excellent story. This engaging movie can be set apart as a thrilling tale with or without the anime it follows. Of course as it stands it is the bow on a perfectly wrapped gift.,2493,288,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As a fan of Haruhi I could not have wished for a better movie.  In fact two and a half hours in to the movie I was disappointed to find out there was only about ten minutes left.  It was that good for me.  All the adventures I wished happened in season 2 coupled with very interesting plot twists new views on all my favorite characters and superb animation make this my favorite movie of all time.  If you ever have 3 hours free you can not go wrong with this movie.,2494,289,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Overrated it was good but not THAT good.,2495,290,2019-04-13 21:35:39

* Note: This may seem obvious to most but I feel like I should state this anyway: Do not watch this unless you have watched the first season of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.,2498,292,2019-04-13 21:35:39

People gush over this movie. I'll be the first to say that while it is a rather good movie and far better than the second half of the series it isn't great. The animation is a mixed bag with the CG getting annoying some of the times. Call me spoiled but when I notice CG in movies I compare it to Pixar not to random shows on TV.,2501,295,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In my opinion a movie totally deserving of it's #1 ranking in the charts at the moment.,2503,296,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well this probably goes without saying but if you watched the Haruhi Suzumiya TV series and you liked them then you will definitely love this movie. However if you’re like me and hated the shows yet watched them anyway for some reason you may want to use your own discretion. This movie is really no different from watching a few episodes of the TV series but the change of format made it way more bearable and I actually liked it.,2507,299,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The Suzumiya Haruhi series has been one that has consistently scored high marks on my personal scale when it comes to quality. Given while I have friends that assert that the light novels are 100% better I find both seasons of the anime to say nothing of this movie to be plenty satisfying. That being said you'll get the most out of this movie if you've watched both seasons of the anime though watching just the first season is also sufficient.,2508,300,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I should start off by saying that this isn't what I expected it to be it was a lot more. I gave it a 6.8 but that was for a number of reasons. Animes like Saki have been around for ages mahjong was just another way to spice it up. For example Beyblades Yu-gi-oh Battle B-Daman to name a few which doesn't help for originality points. However the fact that it was mahjong and was the first mahjong based anime I have watch left it feeling quiet different and was enjoying to watch.. and also made me want to learn mahjong (which I did). I would recommend having at least a basic understanding of mahjong before watching unlike me and having to guess what the hell was happening every time they started playing.,2515,306,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"For one the kids dont look like high school  i wanted to watch something that would have meaning but for only 25 episodes is hard to trully understand the whole plot of it all. This anime is too sentered on the big breasted one when it should be saki the title said it all. Also is hard to follow the game itself and to give it more difficutly they switch  from reality to fantasy in the different characters minds . I like the president and her coniving form to make people play her tune. Nationals is suppost to be the main point and saki playing but the boobs just keep apearing and it took too many episodes explaining the relationship between the characters and each group when in fact they should focus on just the winner one also some characters crossed the line of yuri and whats with the blushes. THe playing itself its exciting but the ecchiness and the flashbacks stopped me from trully enjoying this anime. If your the kind of person that likes to see ecchi then go right ahead and lolli is also a point in this anime . and the only male character is usless at this point i dont see whats the purpose of him . ",2516,307,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Great series! It lagged at times but in the long run it wasruly an interesting piece to watch. Takei Hisa my favorite in the whole thinghus far was simply superb. I loved her character to death. Saki and Nodoka’sntimate scenes really aggravated me the most throughout the whole series. I’meally hoping it’s toned down for the next season. Onward! To the Nationals!,2517,308,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Disclaimer: This is not a site review. If you're reading one of these it's unlikely I'll ever write a site review for this anime. Probably because I don't want to pick it apart. ^_^,2520,310,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Saki is a series that falls imbetween two genres. There's too much ecchi for those who don't like it and not enough of it for those who do. I think this sums up why a lot of people don't like Saki. But what are they missing out on?,2521,311,2019-04-13 21:35:39
       Basically Saki is about a small high school Majong club. It's members are from various years and are almost all female (one guy but he's usually ignored anyway). The show includes a team tournament (most of the show) an individuals tournament (squished into a few episodes at the end) and random fillers inbetween (training camp swimming etc.) Using Majong is quite original although the plot is otherwise ordinary.,2522,312,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The first of the Slayers movies gives us a mildly amusing story with the introduction of a new main character and a lot more uniqueness to the world than the main television series was able to produce. That said it falls flat in nearly every way and doesn’t entertain as thoroughly as the series did.,2537,327,2019-04-13 21:35:39

My favorite of the Minna no Uta shorts so far this magical tale is a visual treat (reminiscent of Koji Yamamura) with a delightful song in the backdrop. A cute fantasy adventure and at only two minutes in length a quick watch.,2539,329,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a really great anime. It might seem a bit like pokemon but it is really different. From the way you get more cards to how the battles are the overall anime is great. Dragon collection is a rather small anime like the wiki for it doesn't have much info has only 25 pages etc. I recommend it for shonen fans and overall anime fans ,2540,330,2019-04-13 21:35:39

There's not much one can say about something that's only 5 minutes long other than the fact that that is 8 minutes longer than it should have been. Seriously don't waste your time. The ring in the title resembles a giant anus and that is extremely appropriate. This anime is a giant steaming pile of dog crap that somebody left on your front lawn. Just spray it away with a garden hose & go on with your life.,2544,334,2019-04-13 21:35:39
What is this ridiculous monstrosity? Paper-thin Moe archetypes acting out stupidly obvious Yuri scenarios with a vague animal theme that gets haphazardly dragged out occasionally. Oh the cow-girl has large breasts oh the dog-girl is guileless and hungry for affection don't make me laugh. But it did it did make me laugh.,2545,335,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It's probably because I have a certain taste in animes but this one didn't appeal to me. I rarely drop watching animes so O did watch it fully though and I just believed the story line was weak and nothing held my attention. Watching it was a chore and i was happy when I finished. ,2547,337,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Best Student Council had potential to stick out but settled midrange in the vast  All Female Cast in a High School Anime  category - although I give it some props for adding a male puppet for the odd factor. All of the 14 main characters have some quirk/archetype that has been done before but the addition of each past history/secret that unfolded throughout the series kept things interesting enough to continue watching to completion. Unfortunately most of the action is pretty forgettable and is an un-obtrusive series that you can watch with little thought. The Anime News Network review of each DVD summarizes the specifics if you are curious.,2548,338,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I started watching Best Student Council after a recommendation from a friend who said that it was one of funnier school based animes that he had seen.  Well by the end of the series I wasn't sure if he was trying to trick me into watching something that is only average at best or if he just had rather bad taste in school based comedies.,2549,339,2019-04-13 21:35:39

My first review for Anime-Planet please comment and tell me what you think. I appreciate reviews of my reviews greatly. I hope I will encourage fellow anime fans to watch this series and appreciate it as i do. It's truly an unique and terrifying experience that should not be missed. It's a horror and psychological thriller and its nothing you've ever seen before. Now onto the review and thanks for reading.,2551,341,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Boogiepop Phantom is an anime that focuses almost entirely on the dark side of human nature. Now this can be a complete turnoff if you get sick of the same depressed high school kids and extremely dark areas episode after episode. Until the last episode pretty much the only colors you'll see are orange(the sky) red (blood) and black (I know it's a shade not a color). With this anime being made in 2000 the older animation combined with these colors is not exactly a great level of animation. However for the mood the animation works extremely well. Everything seems blurry and washed out and it works wonders with the depressed characters settings and many themes.,2552,342,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The show is pritty nice but some of the things that happen in the show can be a tad bit creppy and disterbing but over all its pritty good,2553,343,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,2554,344,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I will only give boogiepop phantom an overall rating as it is not the kind of anime that would benefit from an in depth analysis of every aspect. It is also the worst anime I have had the displeasure of viewing(Update: No longer the worst!). I won't lie and say it doesn't have it's interesting aspects but it is an overall unrewarding experience.,2555,345,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well since it looks like someone else has kind of summed up the anime I'll just put my little two cents in here. Ok so this movie kind of messes with your head which most of you might know already from watching it. I got lost alot because it keep jumping back in time and to different characters so that really threw me off. I watched this movie twice with a little bit of explanation help from some people I enjoyed it better after that. I was also told something else by another person which makes me want to rewatch the whole series over. But I say all in all in the end it did come together and though some parts make you go  HUH?  I think once you understand it you'll really enjoy it. I would probably give this movie a 7. It kind of reminds me a little like Evangelion because that anime really mindf*cked me lol. I guess that's why I love these types of animes because they some what make you think.,2558,348,2019-04-13 21:35:39

For fans of Tamako Market there could not be a better follow up.  It has all the carefree slice-of-life entertainment that you loved from Tamako Market coupled with a forward-driving plot that doesn't leave you feeling like you just wasted eighty minutes of your life.  (I do love a comic show where something actually happens; where the end really does bring some kind of resolution.) Very well written and conceived with a perfect balance of comedy romance and even a little drama (uncharacteristic of Tamako Market).  It left me feeling very warm in my soul.  One of those rare extras that I loved more than the main show itself.,2568,358,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It was so heartwarming and full of life it made my whole existence to be there to be present in every moment of the action. And also it was so lovely and cute the story itself and the characters I too have fallen in love with Mochizou.. :) Well I recommend it for everyone who are in lack of hope or optimism :) Always say what's in your heart!,2569,359,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As shorts go this one was pretty good. It managed through a very small amount of action to hint at a much bigger plot. The animation quality was high and it very succesfully left me wanting much much more.,2570,360,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Loved it.  It took me until after episode 6 to really start to figure it out in a world somewhere between reality angst & melodrama and metaphor and it all works really pretty great together.  Music and anime was  just a bit off  and pretty creepy like these characters.  I didn't mind the long slow sequences I liked them even but I did get annoyed with too many slow-turning heads and too much unbroken tension from the main character and does he fall to his knees and scream in tears enough in this show?  Haha.  It got so so good after about 6 or 7 episodes.  Hoping and waiting for season 2!,2572,362,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I didn't love this anime. To me there just seemed to be no point in the story or for the characters' interactions. I didn't understand why any of the events that happened did. If it had been longer than 13 episodes I would have dropped it.,2578,368,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you like Welcome to the NHK Paranoia Agent or even liked the Catcher and the Rye book. This series could be for you. It's a story of lashing out adolescences sexual thoughts and showing the bad side of not letting people know who you are or what you're really like.,2579,369,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,2580,370,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Aku no Hana is certainly not for everyone. It's different both visually and in content: it's not an anime that makes you feel happy or good about yourself no escapism at all here. You don't watch it for the fun of it; it took me a good three weeks to finish it I couldn't watch more than two episodes at a time. It's a psychological anime with a dark atmosphere and bucketfuls of tension. I honestly think it's quite perfect. And not because I particularly liked the story or the characters and not only because it's different from your standard anime set in a school with clichèd characters banal dialogues and a storyline we've seen repeated infinite times with little variation. What I really appreciated about it is that it makes clear that anime is an artistic medium to express feelings - very intense feelings in this case.,2581,371,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really enjoyed this it was good. But at a glance you'd probably go 'ew dafuq is dis?!' But once I started watching it I was surprised to find that the story is great! Once I got past some of the characters in the first 4eps cuz they were major pains in the butt. The main character Erin is easy to like and is quite a great character I'm pretty sure you can love her too.,2594,383,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I absolutely fell in love with this anime and the story as it unfolded.

this really doesnt merit a review it was so bad that it has become famous for being bad i mean at least with anime like ghost stories they took a steaming piece of crap and used it to sculp the worlds greatest poop sculpture this however i think even the likes of Little-Kurribo would have a hard time making this funnier than it already is and by funny i mean so bad it might actually bring you to tears.,2606,395,2019-04-13 21:35:39

ANGELIC LAYER was one of the first–if not the first (Fruits Basket may have beat it)–anime series I watched to completion (I had seen a number of classic anime movies before). It has been a long time since I last watched it so this will be limited to general remembrances and impressions. I remember it as a fun cute series. Well-catered to new viewers looking for something light predictable and often cheesy as it is filled with Über-positive over-the-top affirmations and declarations by one-dimensional (if I wanted to be nice I guess I could call them anime archetypes) characters. Introduced me to many of the tropes I'd come to know respect despise and/or be intrigued by in all that I have watched since then. Good animation and several quirky supporting characters added to the pleasure to be found.,2613,402,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really loved this the overall storyline was very cute and ended with no big questions unanswered. It was really heart warming bitter sweet and cute throughout the anime and some of the character were very funny and side relieves from the at times intense moments. Though no 2 characters eally stood out that i would ship since this was more of a mother daughter animeI guess my fav couples would be Icchan and Misakis mom and Ohjiro and Misaki. Overall very lovely anime and i'd recommend to anyone who likes animes with a lil action romance and somewhat comedy~,2616,405,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Interestingly when Iirst came across this anime I was really confused.  There were allorts of fan rankings saying great things about the Rurouni guy andlso this show called Samurai X and there were all these titles andlternate titles and then some other anime that was related but not theVA thing (which I had no idea what that was originally) and so on ando forth.,2625,414,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Rurouni Kenshin is a shonen anime. It is light-hearted and over-the-top sometimes. I really liked this anime. I consider it the best classic anime. But the over-the-top nature of Rurouni Kenshin worked against the anime itself so sometimes it was immature. Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen however is a totally different story. A much much different story.,2626,415,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Looking back at this anime it was really good and I can see why it's getting all its praise theast of the four episodes was beautiful and touching and is something you'll remember. However the other three episodes weren't up to that level. Maybe it is because Iouldn't really relate that well with most of the characters (with thehole Feudal Japan culture) but the first three episodes felt like an even though executed well steriotypical feudal Japan action story. Towards the ending it makes a change towards drama and the shift is done very smoothly. It was only from this point onwards that I really started to love this OVA.,2630,419,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This a masterpiece animation period. It acts as the prequel of the actual series Rurouni Kenshin produced in the mid 90 and is shown around the mid-end of the original manga classic by Watsuki Nobuhiro. However you do not need to watch the lenghty anime series beforehand to appreciate it. This movie defines perfection for me and is the reason why I love animation more than live movies.,2631,420,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It's just a short OVA it lasts only 15 minutes. If you liked Bungaku Shoujo the movie you'll like this too. Actually the OVA was released before the movie but it's essentially more of the same except without all the angst and the emotional turmoil of the movie. It's just Tooko and Konoha in the literature club room talking about books. Tooko asks Konoha to write a  snack  for her and he does so. It's cute and leaves you with a smile.,2632,421,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm of two minds about this movie. One one hand Ninja Scroll features the fastest most fluid and best animation outside of Akira that I have ever seen. The plot is intriguing the fights way cool and the characters bizarre and perversely interesting. On the other hand Ninja Scroll also contains some of the most graphic and gratuitous scenes of violence and rape that I have ever seen in anime movies or otherwise. Definitely not something you'd want to take home to the family. As I said before the art and animation of Ninja Scroll are astounding. You can see individual leaves rustling on every tree when the breeze blows and you can see every slash cut and parry done by Juubei and his antagonists. No stylization here. Of course that makes the gore scenes all the more graphic. I guess it's a kind of tradeoff. Soundtrack is simple but effective using instruments and melodies from the era to augment authenticity. Characters are all done well too. No hero or heroine is flawless (actually they're all pretty flawed) and each has his or her own inner demons to wrestle with. It certainly makes for some good drama. The plot is also better than most; although it does use the tried-and-true  kill x legendary demons  in places it's done so it's not the main focus of the film but just part of the film's events. Unfortunately Ninja Scroll is VERY graphic more than any non-hentai anime you'll see in all probability. If you're easily offended in any way you'll be in for trouble. All in all an amazing anime that should definitely not be overlooked. You won't need popcorn though.,2639,428,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have to admit I love this anime. The only problem I have with it is the fact they never finished it. At least not to my knowledge. I did research on it and could not find the next part. But that is not the case. The story is intriguing and romantic. A wandering swordsmen who really cares for just himself gets caught in a fight that could very well end the world. Strong recommendation to anyone wanting to watch a die hard killer anime. If you Like Gutts you will love Jubei. I also love this rendition of Jubei. His name has been used in numerous animes and the basis of who he is always gets twisted. This is my faavorite version of who I believe Jubei is.,2644,432,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It had a great ballance of action drama and comedy that wasn't over the top but also not to boring.  The artwork was great and showed some great detail.  The characters also were designed perfectly and no matter what you can get sucked into their story.  Overall it is a great series and had the perfect ending.,2659,447,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm gonna try and record my thoughts while they're still fresh in my mind-- I just finished marathoning the series after having some interest in it for quite a while. I rated Sakamichi no Apollon around a 3.5 in my star rating and here's why without spoiling too much of what happens though do read at your own discretion as it does spoil things about the story even if its not exactly what happens.,2674,461,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,2675,462,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2676,463,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I just finished reading the other reviews for Sakamichi no Apollon and I'd like to pitch in. I can understand why some say that it's an average - or even less than so - anime but I don't agree. I don't either agree with those who have given it very high marks though. If you analyse every part separately I do admit it is kind of average. But somehow everything blends together and ends up working quite well. It's a slice of life / romance / coming of age anime whose protagonists are highschool kids with a passion for jazz music. What's different I guess is the 1960's setting and the jazz music - of which though honestly there isn't quite as much as there could have been. There is little plot and the little there is anyway is quite predictable and cliché: poor little nerdy rich boy - Kaoru - who has always been moved around because of his father's job arrives in yet another town and starts going to a new school where he meets the other protagonists he becomes friends with the boy - Sentarou - and falls in love with the girl  - Ritsuko - who in turn thinks she is in love with Sentarou. Standard plot for an anime like this. And the characters are not outstanding either they're just teenagers with teenage problems: Kaoru is the lonely nerd Sentarou is the badass always in a fight Ritsuko is just the very normal caring and shy girl. Maybe Sentarou is the most interesting and memorable one. But in my opinion what makes this anime special is the portrayal of the characters feelings interactions and reactions. I think that is really well done. In a quiet but profound sort of way. But not only that I think this anime managed to capture in an exceptionally good way that moment of life when you discover the meaning of friendship and first love how wonderful it is and how it can come to hurt so much. So don't expect anything showy and flashy or any big surprises. This anime works on another more subtle level. ,2677,464,2019-04-13 21:35:39

all i can say is that this anime is incredible. outstanding story twists and gets you involved into the characters. The music choice is excellent i never bothered with jazz however this story has changed my mind. It also makes you feel appreciation for what you do have and what you wish you could have. top quality! better be more seasons coming!,2682,469,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Akame ga kill is one of the greatest disappointment for sure. ( not the greatest way to add a review LOL but a fact must be stated) though its idea is an original it's the first anime revolving around assassins of course if you wanna watch an anime about assassins you must expect alot of deaths even to some important characters.,2685,472,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"Hi there! well if you wanting to watch this anime i highly reccomend it because  the storyline is epic if your into ",2687,474,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok so first off this anime's plot was well put together not leaving holes where there are a lot of questions yet to be answered but i wont deny that there are a couple. The story followed the plot to the end that you could almost predict the ending if you really read into the episodes as you watch it. Also i wont spoil the ending for you viewers who have not seen it but please keep in mind the genre of the anime before you watch. This is considered a tragedy. Story 9/10,2688,475,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Okay Akame Ga Kill! In my opinion this anime had a lot of potential to explore with great graphics man it's just bloody inconsistent with the story. For plot lovers this anime will be some sort of downfall it had a great 1st episode followed by an out of focus plot slowly diverting it's way around as if the writers didn't plan the whole plot structure in advance and came up with ideas as the episode aired. It gets pretty dark at times which is good but it's just not consistent. All and all it could be a good show for some other guys I mean it didnt get 4 stars rating out of 5 for nothing. So check it out yourselves in my case i always had to convince myself to give the anime's next episode a shot which sometimes i regret.,2689,476,2019-04-13 21:35:39
You know the rules. Watch the first 3 episodes just for a taste. Death flags the anime. The tone of the anime shifts a lot and you can see it in the expressions of the characters and in the drawing styles. ,2690,477,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I had to force myself to write this review.  The reason I had such difficulty is because it is hard to organize my thoughts.  This anime was so close to absolutely incredible so close to a perfect 10 in my book but at the same time I knew that it had major flaws all the way through.,2691,478,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i really like this anime.... and the fact that the story is very realistic to what really happens in war... also the way they wipe out the main and secondary characters was totally cool and yet sad... this anime really shows that there isnt always a happy ending... kakkoii...,2692,479,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay so going into this series I wasn't sure what to expect or if I would even enjoy it. Boy was I wrong! I was hooked from episode one!! The way they play out the story keeps you guessing you never know which characters are the next to fall and which will make it. When you think you know you get whiplashed right back into it never being able to guess what will happen next. I highly enjoyed this series and while I did like the ending..I also wouldn't mind if they made another season. If your into action-packed anime with a great story to go along with it I would give this one a chance!,2694,481,2019-04-13 21:35:39
[SPOILERS] Anime is good but I despise the ending! Everyone except the worst character dies. I loved Leone but she died for no fucking reason. This is just shit.,2695,482,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was tremendous fun to watch!,2696,483,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"The first episode is boringbut all the other episodes are entertaining except the episode 17.I loved this animebut now i think it is stupid.Because there is no second season.Also the story is kinda stupidbecause they skipped about 70% of the manga and then they stopped following the story in manga.Why did they skip 70% of the manga if they were planning to cancel it? ",2697,484,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Akame ga Kill is actually one of the better animes of its genre. We get a lot of the basics: medieval times assassins supernatural weapons etc…,2698,485,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,2699,486,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is very awesome. I kinda like the killing part and the characters aren't that bad. I also heard that some of the episodes of this anime aren't the same as the ones in the manga. But overall this anime is awesome for those who loves gore.,2700,487,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is one of the better ones of the year.,2701,488,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Akame ga Kill! is one of the anime that's thrown in what I like to call  community seperation.  One side loves the death out of it and the other side is ready to throw whatever hate is available at the series. There is a rare 1% that isn't in either of the sides. To be honest it's really not as bad as some think and it is not the new holy grail of battle shounen...,2702,489,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 (THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS),2703,490,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One of my favorite shows of 2014.Good action good amount of blood not afraid to kill main characters.Some fight sequences looked a little incomplete but generally well done.,2704,491,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i personally really enjoy the characters and the fight scenes in the anime i enjoy both the comidical aspect and the seriousness it gets to at times and i appreciate the fact that they are so real about the death in this where it isnt a laughing matter. i also enjoy the whole sword fighting style that they use mixed in with some unuiqe variations to the fighting style (with the teigus) i do feel however tatsumi should keep using a sword and not switch his fighting style because i felt like that fit him-but that may just be me-,2705,492,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Fun to watch but you're not going to learn a single damn thing.,2706,493,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Hmm... I can definitely relate to the mixed reviews.  The first episode ended with such badassery that the hype for this series at that point was completely justified.  Then... things kind of went downhill.,2707,494,2019-04-13 21:35:39
At first I really liked Akame Ga kill.... It has good artwork along with a good story and characters. When there is violence the show does not turn into a barney like show and it shows all of the violence and blood which is a plus. ,2708,495,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Akame ga kil......,2710,497,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Isn't an anime for the weak hearted! Most people disliked the anime due to the hype of the first couple of episodes expecting a different outcome but that doesn't mean the series doesnt have potential since I still enjoyed it to the very end. even though the ending is very controversial I'll still rate it 7/10,2712,498,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This Anime is one of the Best I've ever seen the Animation is great and you can follow the most fights perfekten. The Story is absolutly awseome and also sad I have to say that I cried. The Sound and the feelings the anime want you to get are perfectly used. Characters like Akame are Made pretty good and at all they could be funny too. At all I know why this Anime became and should become hyped. ,2713,499,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Now I loved this anime but to a fault. There were a lot of holes in this anime. When you watched enough of the anime you can essentially guess what's going to happen next especially since the build-up is similar each time a certain event happens. ,2714,500,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story- For an anime thats meant to be based on the manga it deviates too much to consider it an adaption rather than an alternate way of telling the manga. By doing so it losses what made the manga's story so good a muture story of corruption good vs evil and whether too be good some evil is required is turned into an anime about friendship and the motviation to do better once a friend is lost.,2715,501,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I hoped Akame ga Kill! would blow me away. I expected a lot - come on assassins? Violent deaths lots of blood and gore and some fantasy thrown in? This could've worked in a wonderful way. Except it didn't. ,2716,502,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ah looking into the horizon was yet another so called Beast of a Show coming up. Incredibly hyped and all up for a good time Akame Ga Kill was the one to watch at the time of its airing  depeding on who you are.,2717,503,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Warning please ignore all of the biased manga reader opinions. The anime is not perfect you may hate characters at times simply because of impossible out comes. In my opinion Akame ga kill does something and it does it well it conveys emotion into charachters who I wish I knew more about and it does so with gore and violence. The whole point of the anime is to entertain the viewer not present a through and satisfying story. Again most of the 4.5/10 reviews are biased and inaccurate as the story progresses you will become attached to at least one charachter and end up remembering the whole story. Overall it's a must watch action anime screw all the haters XD.,2718,504,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime was confusing as fuck. Not confusing like a Naruto flashback-ception(Like a flashback inside of a flashback) or complicated sience concepts like entropy or quantum mechanics.,2719,505,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'm not the type to rate anything ten out of ten. But this show was awesome. It had gore and a great story. I have a deep understanding in politics so this show really meant something to me. It combined the totalitarianisms of the  the corrupted government. Oh and the darkness and beheading just was the best anime I ever witnessed. Just beautiful.,2721,506,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If content would be at least as elaborate as its title. It's a word play with word 斬る (kiru - to behead) being pronounced same as transliteration of English word  kill . While this can excite my inner Japanese language obsession I can't say that for the actual content of this anime. Like in the Tokyo Ghoul the first episode hypes viewer and nothing but complete mess in subsequent episodes follows. It has dull fighting scenes. There is nothing in story what would hook up viewer. I finished this only to see if the whole series is as bad as it looks after few episodes. Yes it is bad. Now let me spoil here bit. The only satisfaction is that they killed that annoying gay mentor of main male protagonist. Heck they killed them all ... bastards. Except Akane. Which brings me to if she could ass-pull that power (she supposedly had all along) at the end why the heck did the night raid was so afraid of general S.,2722,507,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I can honestly say that I don't think I've ever been this emotionally involved in an anime. Not only did I get attached to the  good guys  but also some of the  bad guys.  What made this even more interesting for me is that it's not like the normal ecchi shows that I like however there were curves to be seen. the story line was well developed and kinda makes me want to read the manga instead of being my normal lazy ass and just watching the shows. Animation was nicely done I found the mixture of exagerated facial expressions and movements to pair nicely with the more realistic renderings. Charaters were amazing I couldn't help but become attached to many of them. That's as far as I'll go so as not to give anything away. The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of a 10 is because I'm not sure if I could put myself through it a second or third time.,2723,508,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 This Anime is quite a good anime for the ones i am/have watched. Not an experienced Anime Reviewer So i'll try to give you what i thought of the anime as good as i can.,2724,509,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show did something that no show has recently done for me. In the first five minutes it turned me off then by the end of first episode it hooked me. It took what I thought would be a lighthearted fantasy romp and turned it into a show where People Die When They Are Killed!,2725,510,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I absoulutely beleive that watching Akame Ga Kill was not a waste of time but they did do a lot of things wrong. I love stories about rebellion but this was very typical and bland. most of the punishments that the Empire bestowed on its people were typical but some were to far fetched to the point where it was boring. The emporor confused me very much. He saw what was happeneing right in front of him and questioned weather or not he was being a good king I think this would be a good aspect to grow on but the emporor had little screen time to the point where he was just a name. And why didn't the Prime Minister just kill the kid. i mean he is just a kid he would probably found a plot convenient loop hole and assumed the throne. Other than that he was just a crazy sadist. He didn't seem to have much influence on the Jeagars so why did he have to be there. I felt most of the characters were ther just to die. I don't mind red shirts but the way they executed it was mediocre at best. The characters were just developed to die. At first I interperted it as a bold move but then it became predictable so the emotions were lost to me. I think the only strong point this anime had was its animation (especially the death sense they were fresh and unique) and Esdeath I feel she was the only one with a suffecient back story emotion (even if she couldn't interpert them at the time) and development. That is it for my reveiw of Akame ga Kill. Sorry for typos :) this is my first reveiw ever so give me a break. If you have anything to add *I'd love to hear it.,2726,511,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay. Let me start by saying that this is a really really good anime. Its seriously enjoyable - I went through the entire series in no time at all. To be clear I judge an anime based mainly on how entertaining it was and then reflect on the overall story. ,2730,515,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Just a few short words on the show - you can be the judge of whether or not you agree with me after you've seen it. There are no spoilers! Also I suggest you read to the end of this review regardless of whether you agree with what is said in the beginning or not.,2733,518,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So in one of my random viewing sprees of anime this was a title I decided to muddle through after realizing what the show was gonna start doing. Sure enough they started dropping like flies. It wasn't until later that I found out the anime had almost nothing to do with the original work from the manga. This is one of those shows that has all the manga fans scratching their heads thinking  wtf did I just watch? .,2734,519,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It's not like this anime sucks or anything the plot is really nice and solid the animation is great and the songs are catchy and nice to listen. Personally i liked this anime just because of the action and the plot. But there are a big problem for this anime and this is only my personal opinion.,2738,523,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I would REALLY like to give this anime a higher rating but i can't....:(,2739,524,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My comment is gonna be short this anime is very gruesome it has a lot of blood and fighting but I think that wheat make this anime so interesting. Like when I was in the first episode the main character got a job in the capital I had no idea that the people he was working for were evil and they tortured his friends.big as no idea I thought he would work in the capital the later in he would individually meet the other characters but I was dead wrong. This anime would a good anime to watch if you want some action and little comedy and be prepared when you see people start dying.,2740,525,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2741,526,2019-04-13 21:35:39

AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2743,528,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I would say I love the concept and the story line so far but then I'm still struggling between love and hate this anime. I did wish that more peopl from the 'Night Raid' survive and I kinda ship Tatsumi with Esdeath. I know I might the only one who shipped them but they're just so cute >.<,2744,529,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2745,530,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,2746,531,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Fell in love with it after watching 1st episode and it never got slow or boring ever since.,2747,532,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Howdy! How are your guys doing? I'm sorry for not posting reviews lately I've been busy with school homeworks/exams. And I need to finish watching the anime I'm currently watching.,2748,533,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The series starts off well as you see the main character starts his travel into the sadistic and corrupted world. You quickly see tension as the protagonist is weak and ignorant. But within the first few episodes the tension is lost as the character starts to settle in with the assasin group and they go off killing people. As for the story if you don't like what you see by episode 5-7 then give this a pass because it is more of the same until the end. Not that it was bad but it was predictable. You get the direction the show is taking and can expect it throughout the whole series.,2749,534,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I like it very much. Because it's not like other shounen were only a few ppl die. It wouldn't even suprise me that the mc would suddenly die(but that's probably just me). And the action is awesome i like the plot about assasins and the corrupt capital. It's one of the coolest anime i've ever seen.,2750,535,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It's good but the original story from the manga is far superior and longer too. The ending wasn't well thought out so the last 7 or so episodes aren't great but evrything before that follows the manga and is amazing,2751,536,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: Well story wise Akame ga Kill was pretty average a couple plot twists here and there which I was able to predict. Like in Attack on Titan all the chatacters were dying like flies. I believe that the shock factor is what stood out the most. The ending was deplorable as it didn't even feel like an ending if there was a second a season I dont think that I'd even watch it because almost EVERYONE died. Each episode brings a new character with fabulous powers over 9000 that just CAN'T be defeated. On a good note characters aren't given invincibility becuase the plot DEMANDS that th character stay-the story does not revolve around certain individuals but we can still easily identify the main protagonist. This anime will do something I usually don't mind- a character dies there is an emotional heart tugging scene BOOM someone cracks a joke and all is good once more... ok,2752,537,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I enjoyed this anime much more than I thought I would. It's not really your run of the mill kind of anime I felt. Pretty awesome animation and fight scenes smooth and imaginative. ,2753,538,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Today in my little review corner we're going to look at yet another series from the Summer season of 2014. Let's dive into this one and disect it into tiny little pieces!,2756,541,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2757,542,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really love this anime. Everything is almost perfect. But what I don't like is that this anime has too much ecchi scenes. This anime is reccomended for 15+.,2758,543,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,2759,544,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,2761,546,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To be fair I'll go ahead and mention I had to drop this series about 10 minutes into episode 5 because my tolerance completely wore out.  So I can't speak for what comes after but I can fairly clearly see where this is headed and it does not appeal to me at all.,2762,547,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2765,548,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 Cross Ange.   (Review after watching up to ep 10),2766,549,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Action mecha suits magic dragonslove tragedy military... If you love any of thse things than you'll probably like Cross Ange. That only if you can look past the constant flaunting of partial or even full nudity but whyy couldn't you? Only close-minded people could watch this and not see the story for what it is. Amazing! It tackles bretrayal love and loss and shows both the dark and light sides of humanity. So definitely watch this if your open minded enough to not be put off by the 'ecchi' component because it's an amazing story,2767,550,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was reluctant to review this anime. I am only doing this so that mature viewers don't get put off by the childish reviews that are already floating around here. Read the review by Baeron for it is the only one worth reading if you're looking for basics about this show and a good point of view on the mature themes - I will try not to copy that here. Credit needs to go where it's due.,2768,551,2019-04-13 21:35:39
lets introduce mature themes as rape discrimination and gene-manipulation and resolve these problems with shounen style  power of love  and  anything can be fixed if you hit it hard enough  then add insane amounts of ecchi. also very shaky characters (mood swings all over the place trauma's apear and disapear at random),2769,552,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So after finishing this anime I enjoyed it for the most part in how everything ended but of course this is really not for everyone. For anyone interest be warned that this anime is not pretty especially in the beginning but the fact is it will make you feel certain emotions. This anime can't be judge on only first several episode and truly can only be understood if you watch the entireity of it but doing so may be difficult for some.,2770,553,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I am intriqued by Cross Ange because I do not know what to expect from episode to episode.At first Ange is the ideal princess in the public's eyes and she tried to live up to everyone's expectations.After her fall from grace (no spoilers) she fights against eveeyone's expectations and also the viewers.The show is not perfect but I think it is pretty entertaining.,2771,554,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"Slap Up Party: Arad Senki is a rather slow paced and basic shounen anime. Some things do stand out that I found rather enjoyable. ",2772,555,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wonderful adventurous Anime. we want season 2 only thing i didnt like the Hiria Erbek Harsen as keep on murdering people and they show them like good fellows execpt this everthing is good and every character is enjoyable,2775,556,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well this show turned out to be a major disappointment.,2776,557,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: It's a really basic storyline and even then its a slow progressing one. Episodes often feel disjointed and don't really lead up to each other until late in the series. Basically it's a group of main characters coming together and setting off on a journey that eventually ends up with them saving the world. Great.,2777,558,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,2778,559,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Tennis all the way! ♥ Effort. Drive. Focus. Commitment. Determination. ♥ The love to become someone great or excell at something truly shows in this anime. The animation was too great and there was hesitace for romance but true tennis lovers will definitely enjoy it.,2779,560,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,2780,561,2019-04-13 21:35:39
(SPOILER ALERT) I feel after watching this movie/episode/OVA that the story could have been more romantically at the end. My guess is why they didnt do that is that it would break the story its flow of one person admitting his/her love and the other person vaguely accepts but in this case I think they should have (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT incomming) kissed. As it would have been the perfect moment for it and it would definitely not break the flow of the story if you take the former base story ending into context. At least that's what it is in my opinion. Also the shouldnt have made it 45 min since it could have been a bit more shorter.,2781,562,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story – 9,2782,563,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In the beginning I admit I wanted to drop this anime. I could predict everything these shallow-seeming characters would say the animation got on my nerves and one character just wouldn't stop crying... yet I found myself laughing at every single joke.,2783,564,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Lovely Complex,2784,565,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Some parts of this dragged and dragged and dragged. Took meike 2 or 3 days to get to episode 15 and then stalled it out for a good 3 or 4onths because I was aggravated with Otani’s stupidity. And then.. Risa’stupidity level went through the roof in the latter half. Really the bestarts of this series were the last two episodes. They were executed very wellnd the animation was great. For that I’m giving it a higher score then Iriginally was. Another thing that got on my nerves was the southern dialect. Iad such a hard time trying to figure out some phrases and such even though Iad subs going as well. In the end it was an alright anime with a great veryredictable ending.,2785,566,2019-04-13 21:35:39
this story its really funny,2786,567,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,2787,568,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Lovely Complex is a romantic comedy about a growing love relationship between a not so average girl Koizumi Risa and a not so average boy Atsushi Ootani. It's a perfect romance anime for teenage girls but is it perfect in all ways? Let's see.,2788,569,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2789,570,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2790,571,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok so here's a somewhat popluar love story that is right about what you're expecting. Happy I watched this one as well. A good romance with some great humor and an overall fun story.,2791,572,2019-04-13 21:35:39
At first I thought this anime was going to be boring and not very interesting.  However I gave it a second chance and I'm very glad I did!  This anime really got me laughing and crying.  It was very hilarious.  The characters were very interesting.  Also the storyline was exciting to me; it's not an everyday thing to see a couple where the girl is taller than the boy.  If you haven't watched this yet give it a try!,2792,573,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime all started because of a tall girl and a short boy who tend to fight but are actually close friends. Koizumi the girl starts to like Otani the boy. Otani can't relly see them as a couple after all the years that they have been together the anime is just how she one over Otani's heart. I loved the story of this anime i guess because I am a tall girl so I can easily relate.,2793,574,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,2794,575,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,2795,576,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really enjoyed the story. It was a bit weird for me at first because of the whole short guy and tall girl story and there were parts where risa did such embaressing things i get embaressed for her and it makes it hard for me to watch through. BUT its really sweet and cute and WORTH watching. theres not a lot of character development at all with the side characters so the main focus is between risa and otani. its very funny also :),2796,577,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2797,578,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: It did it for me! :p it made me laugh and it made me cry. I thought the story was unique. Definitely not your usual school life type of anime!,2799,580,2019-04-13 21:35:39

AKARI~~~~~~N. This show is back for another amazing season. Prepare to laugh at the ridiculous amounts of puns and enjoy some amazing character development.,2802,583,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Rarely do I ever marathon so many episodes in a row butarimite is just unbearable not to watch. Sachiko is such a pleasure to watchlong with “some” of the other characters in the cast. Since the story revolvesround Yumi whom I like just as much as Sachiko.. maybe a bit less lets beonest hah.. I can’t help but like her. Yoshino’s being very frank and honestbout anything can be really  funnyometimes too. Really the only person I didn’t like was Touka. I understandhat she’s stubborn and stuck up but my god woman get over it. It’s so obvioushat she was spoiled growing up even though she’s a foster child. Suruguachiko’s fiance (I can never remember his family name) has become a reallyood character too. His advice to Yumi on multiple occasions was really reallyood.,2803,584,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,2804,585,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2805,586,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The animation style is the moving comic book. It starts off with two ninjas facing each other. I found it pretty slow moving. I stopped watching about 15mins into it. It probably wouldve been more interesting if the narration wasnt so monotone,2806,587,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i REALLY REALLY like this story. it's just really old that makes it hard for me to watch since i prefer modern animation. its a good  anime with poor animation. if you dont mind the animation and get past it its a realy good story. i only watched up to episode 7 so far but i have a hate and love relationship with continuing to watch,2808,588,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It was really good especially the storyline but it was too short.,2813,592,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"I've watched quiet a few anime now and i've come to realise that some anime just don't receive the recognition they deserve. Switch is just that. It was captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved watching the OVAs but my biggest criticism would have to be that the ending was in alot of ways confusing i thought incomplete and i was left feeling like i wanted to know more about the story. ",2814,593,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To start of the story begins with a liar girl and her constant lies about having a boyfriend just to stay being friends and then she takes a random picture of a boy somewhere who happens to be in her school and the prince of girls by looks to boot nut turns out to be a twisted character and makes the female lead his servant. Which we are all familiar with i.e stupid hardworking female and smart cruel male lead. And honestly I expected nothing much. It took me a while to watch this. Once the story started to roll around things got better ...best if I must say disregarding a few things. If it were me I'd not do such things but it's fiction to begin with. Anyways the story eventually shows more of the characters personality and mainly the protagonists own growth through their relationships with other. It's not that cliché or that funny. The romance is something I loved thoroughly.,2815,594,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really love this anime it is so funny and romantic and cute!!!! Well I think it is cute anyways.   ,2816,595,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Based on 7 episodes.,2817,596,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This story was so great. It was rich and it has a deep meaning. A lot of people can relate to a bunch of these characters. ,2818,597,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is absoultely perfect for anyone that loves silly short romantic comedies! I loved every part of it but i'd have to say the only frustrating thing in the story is that you dont get too much background on any of the characters. And the ending feels so incomplete!! Besides those two things (i'm a little nitpicky with my animes) the anime is wonderful and is really fun to watch!,2819,598,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Such an amazing anime!! I would love and willing to re-watch this in the future!! it is rare for me to watch a girl to guy type of anime!!! And also I love Erika's personality the one that simply wont gives up easily!! those kind of girls I'm always looking for an anime! I hope they get season 2 cause this anime was too freaking good! I suggested this anime to my friends and they love it! ,2820,599,2019-04-13 21:35:39
FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF WOLF GIRL AND BLACK PRINCE,2821,600,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'm really upset this anime is over. I don't think the ending was really expected so quickly ( I thought I'd get to see more) I really wish that they continued it since there were so many different ways they could've ended it which could've been better... I think the last episode was definately cute and funny like the rest but nothing made it stand out as the last episode which was a huge dissapointment to me. The story was definately a great one and I hope they will come out with a second season but I have to give this show a 6/10 reguarding the ending. I also think that they may have became a couple a little too soon in my opinion. In general the whole show moved a little quicker than the kind of pacing that I prefer. But all in all it gets a 6/10 from me. ,2822,601,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a silly romantic comedy which is fun to watch. ,2823,602,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a very typical shojo but not a spectacular one. It is neither amazing nor bad rather it dances precariously on the fence between the two. The female lead is your generic sweetheart while the male protagonist takes his 'manliness' a little far in my opinion. I found his attitude trying and his over all personality rude domineering and arrogant.,2824,603,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I was really surprised at this series I was not expecting much of it. As I watched it I was dragged into it and ended up finishing it in one sitting. The characters were in perfect balance with each other and the story progressed very well. I have to say this show is a must see for anyone that enjoys a good romantic comedy.,2827,606,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I absolutely loved this anime.,2828,607,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Honestly when the anime started I didn't think I would be finishing it but I said to myself  At least finish the first episode.  So I was really surprised when I watched the entire series in two days.,2829,608,2019-04-13 21:35:39

     Pumpkin Scissors tells a story of a nation resembling Western Europe.The main character Alice L. Malvin is a Liutenant of section 3 of the imperial army. The idea of  Pumpkin Scissosrs  used as section 3's name is none other than it's job to relieve the scars of people within the nation  after suffering an all-out war section 3 breaks the shield of corrupted goverment and nobilities like a scissor tearing a pumpkin from the outside. Other members of the Pumpkin Scissors are also introduced in depth as well as the  Invisible Nine  even though it's quite brief. The story is full of intrigues and idealism yet it's still quite empty for the viewers at times especially at the end.,2834,613,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,2835,614,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Big robots and boobage half of any good story. In that regard you won't find Vandread lacking. It has plenty of jiggling delights as well as shiny robots going at each other. One thing i particularly liked about it was that they don't advertise the ecchi. If it happens it happens but the producers don't go out of their way to make a girl fall into a questionable position just so we can get some eye candy. That makes the ecchiness all the more wonderful.,2836,615,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First and foremost this anime is a comedy.  As a comedy it is hilarious but if you have hang ups about stereotypes than you may want to avoid this show.  It plays on gender stereotypes and uses that as a source of humor.  It does an excellent job of twisting stereotypes into good humor.  The opening line kind of spells out the direciton of the anime in how it likes to poke fun at such silly things.  There are a few annoying drawbacks such as the uber squeaky voice of Dita or her annoying repetitive dull habit of refering to Hibiki as  Mr. Alien  even after he and others tell her different.  Or the annoying overly gung ho way Hibiki repeatedly selfishly and self centeredly enters combat and ofte ignores any attempts at teamwork.  His overbearing drive to appear masculine ultimately has a reverse effect and make him seem the most insecure of annoying bothersome brats ever seen in any anime.  His voice is almost as annoying and repetitive as Dita's.  Like I care if he proves his existance given his personality I'd rather he didn't exist.  He has a few funny lines however but his terrible voice and personality almost ruin the show.  Dita's creepy squeaky bubbly aura isn't much better but most of the other characters seem pretty solid.  This is probably one of the few animes with the top two lead characters you might want to hate wholeheartedly.  ,2837,616,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In the first part I was quite disappointed the story wasn't very appealing and the characters weren't strongly introduced so you don't really know their names and have that  anime bond  feeling.,2838,617,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Overall very enjoyable.  Saddy like so many others it would have benefited from leaving off the last few episodes.  The need to tie up the ending made it trite and cliche what had otherwise been an engaging story.,2852,625,2019-04-13 21:35:39
What is perhaps most interesting about this one is how close the animeomes to being a classic without ever actually becoming one. Whileatching Wolf's Rain there were numerous times in which I couldee the anime approaching the kind of exhilarating grandeur found initles like Cowboy Bebop and Crest of the Stars. However the showould always back away at the last minute as if an invisible wall werereventing it from progressing any further.,2858,626,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Top 10er alert! near on all information would give this lil baby away so ill refrain what I can say is werewolves arn just by the full moon there on command and this follows the journey some take in order to find there tru goal. I cant say more than I love this series. It is a serious anime. A ending which is worth the build up and a very mighty ducks attitude with a gurren Lagann tactic.,2864,631,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you liked the OVA's you'll probably disappointed with this. Now while it does flesh out the story behind some of the characters and their personalities it manages to do so in a surprisingly dull and boring manner which takes alot of work with a fighting anime.,2891,650,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is legendary anime in Japan. You shouldn't think this as baseball anime. characters are too abnormal. Thinking this as comedy you may be able to enjoy this. And this show has second season.,2892,651,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Would have been in my top 10 list. Only the problem with this anime is the characters have an objective which is making their clan name famous through that world in search for the main chars friends. But they don't really do much to make theirself famous. I hope they will in the 2nd season if one comes. Btw i just love how overpowered momonga is i just love it. :o ,2905,660,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First time leaving a 'review' as such so forgive me for the unconventional approach. I just had to post this as this anime has completely shattered my preconseptions of it.,2906,661,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First of all a disclaimer I only write reviews of animes that I've watched completely.,2907,662,2019-04-13 21:35:39
(͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)� It was an okay story with an interesting protagonist. The other characters lacked in some ways having the most of basic emotions such as jealousy anger revenge etc. There were too many lines for an anime lots of explanations too. I wished it felt more like an anime not a manga. ,2910,663,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I was quite satisfied how the anime ended (hoping for the 2nd season?) the story was good but not that good mostly because of the 13 episodes. I definitely liked the characters and anime 9/10 overall from me would definitely recommend to look at this.,2913,666,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Light novel adaptations MMORPG anime sucks. When I started to watch Overlord I did not expect much. I was thinking it will be just attempt to ride on wave of SOA Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka. I was wrong. It is quite simple. The story builds on rule of cool action and occasionally on a comedy (kind of like DBZ).,2915,667,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sekai-Ichi Hatsukoi 2 is an awesome second season. Finally seeing the stories from the first one all wrapped up does the heart good. This series instantly going on my faves list for great romance anime. Even though its yaoi I feel that it is gentle enough for all lovers of romance stories. The character's all feel like people I know in real life so it was very easy for me to identify with them. I also love the fact that not every character in the series gets their happy ending that made it feel real. If you love romance stories you have to give this series a look. ,2916,668,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Oh my God...I think I may have found a new favorite show. Honestly it really doesn't have much plot. It is slice-of-life and very soapy but I was seriously addicted during and really sad when it was over. They could have made like six more seasons and I would have gladly marathoned all of them. I wouldn't mind the love scenes to be a little more risky but they were all good. I also wanted the uke characters (especially Ritsu) to show a little more vulnerability. All in all every storyline and set of characters was interesting and emotional to watch. My favorites were Takano and Ritsu for sure. Takano out of everyone was my favorite...you hardly know anything about him and yet you feel like you know him. It was just a very fun and interesting watch.,2917,669,2019-04-13 21:35:39

While I didn't really like the story of this movie the execution was brilliant.  I'm not much of one for the love-at-first-sight thing or the  you're the only possible one for me forever  thing either.  However the storytelling was inspired the art was interesting the script was brilliant the characters popped off the screen.  Music was fine but nothing great.  ,2923,673,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Another confusing movie from the master himself Satoshi Kon just the way I like them xP. It was nice to seence again that his distinct way of storytelling isn't limiting theariety in his works too much: the message it gets across and thetmosphere of the movie were quite different from his other works evenhough it was very recognizably a Kon movie.,2926,675,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Not a review as such more a little information on what's what with the OVA content. The Wiki lists 13 episodes in the OVA section but since this site has them grouped individually I thought I'd add a little more detail for the distinction.,2931,680,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I think people are a little harsh onhis anime and who wouldn't be with a plot line like that. It'sertainly bizarre and incoherent sounding and hard to believe somebodyctually came up with that. Yes you read the description and you knowhat yes indeed it is totally about soda drink cans. If you can getast the bizarre theme enough to actually give this anime a try youill come to find that this actually is a pretty funny entertainingerverted and at times touching anime.,2933,681,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Check it out definitly it kind of reminded me of sekirei but with a less deeper plot.

Steins;Gate: Fuka Ryōiki no Déjà vu o para entendernos Steins;Gate: El Déjà Vu del Área de Carga Negativa es una película animada por White Fox para aprovechar el inmenso éxito que tuvieron con su anime pero ¿Vale la pena la película? o ¿Estuvo a punto de destruir la buena historia que habían tejido con su anime? Yo diría más que lo segundo.,2943,689,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 I held off from watching this for a while mainly because I was under the impression that nothing in the world could be better than Steins;Gate.

This had a lot of potential but by the end it was just painful to watch. During the first episodes you wonder why they are just 4 minutes when it certainly deserve to be more but by the final episodes you tell yourself  oh thats why .

So have you ever wondered what would happen if you pissed off a animal’s shrine? They are just like human shrines and would curse you of course. That’s pretty much how this story starts. A guy breaks a shrine for a cat and so is cursed by being able to talk to cats. Wouldn’t be so bad if he wasn’t allergic. Add this to a slice of life school life anime like this and well…. you have Nyan Koi.,2967,712,2019-04-13 21:35:39

 If you need a reason to laugh then that is what you are looking for. Since it is made quite funny you are going to laugh without realizing it. Even if there are many female characters it is in my opinion no Haram anime since it is not like other animes where the female characters behave as emergency horny girl. It's not like I would not like it but sometimes it's just too much.,2982,724,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ok let’s get one thing straight I am not a fan of harems. The setup I always get is one spineless guy and a bunch of overly gorgeous girls waiting on him hand and foot for some ungodly reason. In the meantime you get loaded with fan service frequent misunderstandings and a busload of female stereotypes that can sometimes get downright degrading. With all this in mind and the fact that Nyan Koi is in fact a harem why did I enjoy it? Why did I not really hate all the clichés and not mind the fan service as much? Why do I give this a three star rating out of five versus tons of other harems that receive 2 or less? Well here is my best attempt to try to explain why I think that is.,2988,729,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I decided to marathon this one over the course of a day oro. It was very funny and was a pretty good mood lifter for me since I couldn’to anything this year for the holidays. The only thing I was reallyisappointed about was that the show techincally didn’t’ end. There’s plenty ofhings to go off of still and nothing has been resolved.,2989,730,2019-04-13 21:35:39
At first I wasn't going to watch the show but my curiosity pulled men. I have to thank my curiosity. I really liked this show. While itad a lot of generic things in the show I think they did it right. Iind most of the male protagonists annoying in harems but this showas different. I actually found it funny which is really odd for me.hile I love anime I usually don't like the humor in them.,2990,731,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a character-driven action show.  That said the story of the anime isn't its strong point.  While the plot is actually pretty cool involved and interesting it doesn't all make sense until the very end after you've thought about it for a while and made all the connections.  The setting is never fully explained so it can all be pretty confusing if you're not willing to think about it.  So why the 9.5/10?  Because everything else about this show is pure gold.,2999,737,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Before we begin with this review allow me to explain that I have NOT seen Eureka 7. Many people who love the wildly popular anime say that it is very similar to Xam'd but a great anime. Understand that people who think that Xam'd is just a copy of their favorite anime still admit that this is a great anime. Hold that in mind while reading this.,3002,740,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Xam’d Lost Memories (pronounced zam-d) AKA Bounen no Xam’d is a unique 26 episode sci-fi war anime that reminded me a lot of anime like FMA (same studio) Eureka Seven Evangelion and even Valkyria Chronicles (the game haven’t watched the anime). The setting is some sort of strange sci-fi future world where there’s anti-gravity technology and flying ships (ala Eureka Seven) sometime after a war and a neutral country is being plunged into another war. In an early moment you see the results of the destruction and fighting and realise what a serious anime this is. Amidst the chaos Isshu’s postal ship continues on its deliveries of mail and parcels while some mysterious events are set in motion for Akiyuki all revolving around something called Xam’d.,3006,744,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As I have already seen both RahXphone and Eureka 7 the story is very similar but little less emotional than either RahXphone or Eureka 7. This story happens in some parellel world with a breed of people having some extraordinary powers.,3007,745,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Intro...,3010,748,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you've heard of this show you've likely seen all the familiar predecessors and the bottom line is there isn't really anything new or original here.  It starts off as a very unique and compelling show (with all the usual tropes and cliches) but slowly devolves into just another generic anime shortly after half-way.  By the end you'll be scratching your head over what you just saw when you realize the show has literally come full circle and not really answered much of anything.,3011,749,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm glad I got to see this anime because now I can beat the crap out of it. It's about a little girl who has a fascination with underwear? How could anyone who's only in it for the ecchi like this repulsive trash. I know what some are thinking it kind of aims to be bad but just because an anime seemingly aims to be bad on purpose doesn't make it any less of a bad anime and Chu-bra is no exception.,3014,751,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I gave Chu-Bra a chance even though it didn't sound too appealing to me. At first I thought it was pretty alright but the series dragged on and became completely pointless.,3015,752,2019-04-13 21:35:39

When I began watching this anime I thought it would be a nice cute light sweet anime and as the show progressed that general theme didn't change but it did become incredibly tiresome.  The characters develop (if you can really call it development at all) in predictable and irritating ways and the story just falls flat in the end.  The animation itself and the music are both fine but neither are exceptional.,3025,760,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A nice relaxing anime with an interesting twist. I can honestly say this is the only reverse harem I've seen that features older men. I was worried it would be about lecherous old men drooling over a young woman but it wasn't. If anything the men are portrayed as sex objects more than the women! It is romantic in a unique way and the plot is actually quite interesting. The food isn't quite center stage and it is more about the main character getting her life together. The ending gives me a good sense of closure and leaves with with a warm and fuzzy feeling.,3053,780,2019-04-13 21:35:39

K-on was your average slice of life anime with a unique twist an all girl rock band.  that twist was great and helped add somewhat of a plot to the series but eventually what really got me was the moe of the series centered around Mio and Azu-nyan.  Mio is one of those characters one cant not love.  Along with her bass skills and singing ability she is amazing.  the one character that really got me was Mugi mostly cause of how strange she was with her radish eyebrows.  K-on provided a great mix of music comedy and life.,3066,792,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Spending an entire day just watching this anime (easy to do considering it was only 13 episodes) It was a  cute  anime. The jokes kept me amused through all 13 episodes some of them did follow along with other episodes but honestly some of the jokes they kept on pushing didn't get old through the show. Found this was a recommendation under azumanga and lucky star i can honestly see it. The animation seemed to follow the paths of Azumanga while the  cute  factor flowed over from lucky star. I can compliment the show all day but there are reasons behind me giving it lower then 9s or 10s.,3073,798,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Basic school-girl plot with adorable and charming characters.  Fun and spirited.  All four girls are silly and easy to enjoy.  The rendering of the instruments is amazing.  Music is fairly good too.  I loved the first 8 episodes at least until Azusa arrived.  Her character is completely inconsistent swinging between cranky nasty child and stoic bitch.  She regularly insults the K-On girls while simultaneously begs for more of their music.  She is emotional and whiney.  The dynamic between the other girls also seems to change for the worse; not as appealing as they were.  The first half of the series is worth watching for the fluff moe and sweetness.,3074,799,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This review is about the first season of K-on.,3086,809,2019-04-13 21:35:39
K-ON! is an incredibly endearing anime while it isn't particularly earth shattering it is probably one of the best of its genre.,3087,810,2019-04-13 21:35:39
K-ON!: Ias slightly reluctant to start this anime as I am not too fond of very girlynd cliché animes but this one surprised me. This one starts a bit slow and thectual plot doesn’t take affect till about halfway through the series but itakes sense. This anime is not only based around music but friendship and howo adapt in new places. when I started watching this show I kept waiting forhe band to finally worm but as the show goes on you realize it is almostothing about the band itself but the relationship between the characters. justnow before you watch this it is very high schooly and girly (pardon theanguage). this show was very good though and did keep me interested.,3088,811,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,3089,812,2019-04-13 21:35:39
K-ON! season 1 introduces us to the girls of the Ho-kago Tea Time band. Yui Ritsu Mio Tsumugi and Azusa. These girls play classic/indie rock. The story is very good and the season ends with a cool final live show. What i enjoyed most about K-ON! is that the story is about  real  characters and what they would face at a school. no Sci-Fi or magic etc. Very cool!!!!,3090,813,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"I was recommendedhis anime when it was into its second episode and I immediately loved it. Eachpisode has its own little story following each of the girls’ progress to reachhe goal of performing live. Explained from the other reviews here the storyollows four girls in an after school club involved in light music (technicallyop music). Our main character Yui joins the group even though not havinglayed any instrument before (except Castanets). Under the guidance of theassist Mio Akiyama Yui learns how to play the guitar (or “giitah”; Yui’s petame for her guitar). ",3091,814,2019-04-13 21:35:39

K-On is a 13 episode slice-of-life comedy anime with a core theme of music giving off a vibe of a shoujo anime. But don’t let my words fool you this is relaxing and chilled-out type of anime and is a fair bit like Lucky Star in animation it might seem off-putting but the proof is in the pudding. It’s an anime about a high-school music club that forms a band and the things they get up to. I chose to watch this in my breakfast chill-out slot having just finished Minami-ke. Please note that this review is for both the first season of K-On and the DVD extra K-On - Live House which I watched alongside.,3093,816,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't give long reviews so just read this and be done with it quick.,3094,817,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It was a fun pointless show. It really didn't have much of a storyut I thought the characters were great. It had so many cute moments. Ion't have much to say about it really. It entertained me and that ishat really matters to me.,3095,818,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The unique thing about any  Slice of life  series is the fact that theyll seem to be enjoyable despite the lack of any major groundbreakingr epic plot that results in saving the world or universe. The reasonhey work is because ordinary people can relate to similar events inheir own lives. K-ON! is a series that simply follows the lives ofour then five high school girls who form their school's light musiclub. Here's the breakdown:,3098,819,2019-04-13 21:35:39

i felt like i was in Sunday school watching a christian movie. The whole time i was expecting the  plot   to develop. The entire movie was alot of talking more like explaining the life of buddah. Needed more action if i want to find out about his teachings i would have googled it.

I was looking at the top ranked anime and saw Gurren Lagann near the top. Based on the amazing rank especially the movie I watched the anime series so I knew what was happening in the movie.

This is by far my favorite anime so far it has romance action comedy and just pure awesomeness. I love the characters they are all funny but rin who is serious and doesn't talk much is shy doesn't know how to express her feelings because she has never felt them before. But all of that goes away by the end of the show. They end will have you crying for rin and cou to be together and over come all. I would recommend it to anyone who can deal with romance if you're a guy because there is a lot of action. I LOVE THE SHOW <3<3<3<3,3135,844,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It had disappointingly little vampire for a vampire anime which was the only reason I watched it. All the vampire action happened at the begginning or the end and I wanted to wring both Kouhei and Erika's necks for being so difficult and refusing to actually solve all their problems. There had better be a season two or I will be very annoyed at the lack of conclusion.,3146,849,2019-04-13 21:35:39

There are few trends in anime that are as fallible as the visual novel adaptation yet they continue to be made in the hope of finding the next Air Kanon or Clannad. Unfortunately this means that the industry is littered with forgettable titles that have no other purpose than to serve as no brain entertainment for an audience that simply doesn't care anymore.,3154,854,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Animation and audio (especially the music) was good. It was pleasant to watch and all the graphical details were en par with most modern animes.The background music made me think of the tunes from Final Fantasy and both OP and ED music is decent (although you'll probably skip through after viewing it once).,3155,855,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is the final series of the orignal Beyblade series. To me this was the best one yet. All the characters from the first season are back in this one. The battles fought are more interesting and in more deatil. This anime could have been made better but it was still pretty good.

This film if you haven't bothered to read the synopsis takes a intersting spin on the long-running tales of the  gentleman thief  Arsène Lupin III. The OVA shows a world where Lupin III impostors are running amok and stealing in the place of the real Lupin III whose whereabouts are unknown (probably relaxing somewhere). The main character is a pick-pocket thief who works in a ramen shop named Yasuo. One day an old man who visits the shop leaves a green jacket behind without touching his ramen. Yasuo dons the jacket and becomes a Lupin III impostor hoping to become the real Lupin III. Unfortunately for Yasuo the real Lupin III appears and the two must fight for the title of the true Lupin by stealing the Ice Cube: A  diamond  that is sealed deep within the Night Hawk tower the tower of an organization that seems too shady to be gurading a simple diamond.,3180,869,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hayate no Gotoku!! is the next series of the excellent prelude Hayate no Gotoku!. When I began to watch this series I wondered how they could top their previous series and what would be in store for us. I was surprised after a couple of episodes in when I realised that the show when off in a different direction. The first Hayate no Gotoku was all about comedy and parody but the second season was slightly different. There were still parodies and spoof but there wasn’t as nearly as many as the first and they were far between. It was still funny but it was a different type of comedy. Hayate no Gotoku had turned into a sort of harem/romance comedy mismatched with parody. Well I suppose it was always that genre but now it focused more on the harem/romance comedy than the parody.,3199,879,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Mind Game is a movie that is almost as unique as possible. The story the animation and the characters are all constantly shifting which gives it its uniqueness. The message that strength of mind can create an infinite number of possibilities is portrayed in a true mindf*ck fashion often leaving the viewer wondering what actually just happened. After getting past the shock of the continual changes in animation style and the awes from realizing what just happened the story actually starts to make sense (mostly anyways) and it delivers in a meaningful way. The rapid changes in characters seems to flow the lessons they learn seem to make sense and the message they convey seems natural. If you are feeling down about your life watch this and it will make you feel like you can change it. A good watch if you can stomach a bit of mindf*ck.,3211,885,2019-04-13 21:35:39

While the animation may be lacking due to budget and the year the anime was released the overall story is quite amazing.  It starts by immersing you into a dark world where the world is overrun with these monsters called blue.  Its a world where the human population in order to survive set up living facility in space called 2nd Earth but left the majority of people to die as if they were already dead.  For the most part the planet is abandoned and desolate.  Where most of the only remains of humans left are basically these freaky green balls that blue make to feed on later.  The soundtrack also helps to set the mood of the anime (except for the opening and ending).  You'll also the main character lose his mind among other things I'm trying not spoil it for anybody.  My only gripe with the anime however is that only 2 characters in the anime really get development  I mean sure a lot of them die off but it wouldn't have hurt to at least add a little background to some of them like Tony or Joey.,3223,894,2019-04-13 21:35:39

In this political parody Koizumi plays a special form of “mahjong diplomacy” against foreign adversaries such as George W. Bush Kim Jong-il Vladimir Putin Margaret Thatcher and others.

Very twisted and bloody. Bold in what it attempts to do this anime is not afraid to jump forwatd 40 years without warning. Solid music. It fits really well and even stands alone as a great soundtrack. Animation looks great. A mix of action and drama/investigation. Story can get odd and a little confusing. Episodes are longer than normal episodes. Worth watching if you are curious what animes are capable of but be wary of how bloody and messed up this will get. 8/10 worth watching but be ready for it!,3248,909,2019-04-13 21:35:39

All right you sick bastards you want explicit sex and violence? You got it. Luckily I too am a sick bastard that enjoys explicit sex and violence in my anime so I won't be too hard on Mnemosyne. Not for that at least. Mnemosyne starts off spectacularly and ends up an incoherent mess that relies on sex and gore to distract from the fact that the writing fell apart. Still it is rather unique and has a few moments of glory for people other than sick bastards like us.,3258,915,2019-04-13 21:35:39

To keep it simple and short the anime was just a waste of time. It didnt answer anything for me it just confused me more (probably have to see it a second time but not worth the effort). But the storyline was good and had potential it just didnt have time and needed more character development (since the main character's past isnt even fully explained).,3266,919,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Rin - Daughters of Mnemosyne is 45 minutes x 6 OVA episodes of a detective mystery anime with supernatural and explicit themes that I’d probably label as seinen. It’s definitely for the faint of heart even I got chills during my spine during many points of this anime and the sotry is complex to the point where it can even be confusing similar to the likes of Ghost in the Shell. There’s some fairly heavy themes which aren’t obvious at first glance stuff that can put people off. Otherwise it’s a decent blend of detective and spy though some may argue the two are one and the same. Due to the length it’s essentially a 12 episode series but with less intros/outros a bad thing since those bits are pretty good. Looking at the synopsis one would think it’s just gore and sex but first off the latter is depicted sensibly like a movie (i.e. go watch ecchi instead if you want something to perv over) and there’s much more to it. Some real freaky shit. As usual I’ll divulge my dislike of pointless ecchi/fan-service in anime.,3268,921,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well as it pretty evident from the cover of the DVD of this anime it is very sexual in nature. However some of us do enjoy that in an anime and i must say that the entire anime conveys this sexuality in such a way as to make it very interesting and entices the watcher to continue with the series. ,3273,926,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is a sequel to the first Beyblade series. To me this one is a lot better because the story is more exciting but a little confusing. There is a lot of conflict not with the just the antagonists but also a lot of self/inner conflict. This one has a lot more action and more detail. The previous series the bit-beast were all just one colour. In this show the bit-beasts are represented with a lot more detail and are more coloured so they can be more visualized. I would recommend this to young viewers but anyone can watch it if they want to.,3285,935,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If there’s one thing I can credit Futakoi Alternative for it’s foronsistently surprising me; the show changes gears so rapidlyhroughout the 13 episodes that it’s basically impossible to predicthat will happen next. Just when you think the show is running alonghe lines of some GAINAX tripfest the series will abruptly switch tolice-of-life. The creators will wait a few episodes for you to getsed to that and then swerve violently into the angsty romance genre.hen just as you think that the show is going to consistently do thepposite of what you’re expecting the anime will follow formula to aT” and shit out a hackneyed hot-springs episode… just to prove yourong! I can’t think of any show more wildly schizophrenic; even FLCLad the decency to be dependably bizarre.,3288,938,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Parasyte the Maxim is undoubtably the best anime of 2014. Its character devolopment is by far is as good or better than Spice and Wolf. Its plot is dark and does not go into a shitty alien movie its parasytes look realistic. The art style is as quick and pacy as Death note and has intresting dialog.This anime has to be praised for what it is and will last atleast last for another year.,3292,940,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,3294,941,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well the most talked about anime parasyte is now over. Being based on a manga that was written over 20 years ago. So it was an interesting choice. With that in mind here are my thoughts on the anime.,3295,942,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A great show with amazing themes and soundtrack. Every episode kept me on my toes wanting more and wanting to know more. I wont have to wait for another season as the manga has been completed for nearly 20 years. This could perhaps become a new gateway anime for future anime fans who are fans of horror aliens and gore. I would still like to know how the parastyes and the humans will get along in the future.,3297,943,2019-04-13 21:35:39

SHORT REVIEW OF THE FIRST EPISODE OF PARASYTE,3300,946,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Deals with topics revolving around the idea that humans are a pestilence to the planet. It follows a standard modern anime model. Includes topics that have to do with human instict and alien instinct. It is a great comparison between ourselves and aliens. Plays with the classic idea of right/wrong and good/evil. ,3301,947,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Parasyte the maxim is a good watch. Not great but certainly good. The story is interesting enough and the pacing isn't terrible. Animation and sound are decent as well. There is some character development and an ending that can be considered acceptable - even if it could have been better. ,3302,948,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I honestly enjoyed this anime immensely as it always keeps you thinking while at the same time brings fun and action into play. Character development was intense and gave you a great feel of humanity vs nature and wild animals. Would recommend this anime to virtually anyone. Enjoy!,3303,949,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'll keet it simple since other reviewers already stated pretty much what I think about the series.,3305,950,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The base material is not all that matters. At first I wasnt too interested in this anime because I dont like the whole gore-genre too much and usually the drama and visuals are sub-par. Also I watched a few episodes of Tokyo Ghoul which was watchable but disappointing. But after so much hype around it I decided to give Parasyte a chance to beat my scepticism. ,3306,951,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I enjoyed this series the story to me was unique or at least nothing like I have previously watched. The main female was incredibly annoying and clingy imo but it was interesting watching the other chracters evolve as the story continued. The emotions and lack there of was intriguing of the different characters seemed to blend well within the series. The animation was done well and didn't spare detail during fight scenes which was nice because at times I enjoy a series more tards the dark side versus the comical.,3307,952,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,3308,953,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I will keep this short and sweet. I enjoyed this anime. It's animation is average and the pattern of the story isn't unusual or overly unique. It's a parasitic life form which tries to take over the brain and eats humans in order to live. One little parisite doesn't quite make it to the brain and so we have a human with a talking parasite as his right hand. There is plenty of blood and fighting and characters actually do die ect. The story is good but that isn't what really drew me in. I love how the story addressed so many complex and relevant questions. I enjoyed watching two characters who saw the world and humans differently. I also enjoyed the fact that the anime didn't look at the parasites as being all bad. It actually looked at the posibility that the parasites were good and despite the difference in thinking were very similar to humans. I feel this is one of those animes that make you think but also try to look at the situations from an unconventional manner. Not only that but I think it did a very good job at doing so. I also enjoyed the soundtrack.,3309,954,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really liked this anime much more than I thought I would. I read the manga as well. However I really disliked the older 80's style of the characters in the manga so I was glad they did not do that with the anime.,3315,957,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As always there will be an element of bias in this review since I generally dislike series in the action or romance genre.,3317,958,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I first watched it thinking it'd be just average. Oh god I was wrong.,3318,959,2019-04-13 21:35:39
There are those who liked Parasyte and those who didn’t. There are also those who didn’t watch it or are too tokyoghoultards to admit it is better than it; but this analysis is not concerned with those groups.,3320,960,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hi friends I'm back from my break.,3323,962,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I did not think much of the anime when I saw its cover or descriptions. I don't typically like monster animes especially when the monsters can change shapes. But once I got passed that (around episode 3). I found that the flow of the story was perfect. There is lots of emotion in the characters and what I love the most is when there are characters that can REASON with deep thoughts and think in a belivable way instead of acting stupid all the time.,3324,963,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Golgo 13 starts in an impressive way but sadly doesn't keep up the pace. If you want something different for a change go for it. The first 20 and last 10 episodes are good the rest seem a bit like a filler.,3380,996,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The whole thing was just rather lacking taste. The story took forever to actually take effect and the actress was really annoying. The whole thing just felt like a bloated filler...scratch that it WAS a bloated filler bereft of purpose and completely uneventful. I guess if there's one redeeming quality is that the animation was up in terms of quality compared to the series which has mediocre to lame animation. ,3381,997,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The STORY of Softenni follows a group of young girls and their aspirations for their soft tennis dreams - mostly to make it to nationals. (Or to Wimbledon - which can't be done). The cliches in this anime are overdone - especially the amnesia arc.

If Kogepan and his friends don't manage to teach you anything about life and yourself then I feel sorry for you.  In roughly 30 minutes like expertly crafted poetry Kogepan is able to get across more messages and feelings about humanity and happiness than many other series have struggled blindly for 500+ minutes to do.  This short and wonderful series is a masterpiece. ,3394,8,2019-04-13 21:35:39
8 Man After is a cyborg anime.  It is reminiscent of Robocop; however the creation story of 8  Man isn't as cruel.  The world is futuristic people are getting cyborg implants and commiting crimes.  The pinnacle of cyborgs is one with a cybernetic brain but human personality.  The technology for the cyborg brain is top secret and the criminals on the street have yet to access it.  For the brain to handle cybernetic implants a drug is needed.  There is also a  love story  that isn't very well done in my opinion.  The overall OVA is extremely memorable due to 8 Man having to  fight  to keep himself from being just another killing machine.  The most memorable aspect about the animation is when 8 Man runs faster than the eye and the swaying motion they portray.  It's awesome.,3396,9,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Noragami is one of those shows that is very fun to watch with an eccentric cast but just doesn't seem to fit the bill in terms of story.

This was quite an interesting movie. In a way one it's kind. I love the fact that it's based of an actual folklore and famous and old book series  called The Eight Dog Warriors. It doesn't actually start off from where the book starts off but is just a excerpt from it. All the same the movie itself is very wonderful. It is gritty and soft at the same time. It has a tragic and harsh sense of reality yet it still has room for humor joy an romance. The scenery and music  is beautiful. The characters are intersting as well.  They are very loveable. The encounters they have with each other and hint of past connections with others is very interesting.  It's ending is finished strong with a beautifully soft flow. It also hint's the possibility of conituation but can easily just be the end. The only thing I wish they could have done differently is started it from the very start. I wanted to know what happened to some characters previously to get them to the point they started them off with. They could possibly make a movie that preluded this one along with one that continued. It could have easily have been a good anime as well but I applaud them for the way they chose to film it all the same. It's a beautiful tale and highly recommend to others to watch or atleast try!,3433,33,2019-04-13 21:35:39
There's this crystal right and it turns into a large shield. With guns. Or I think it was a crystal as these mecha are blinged up with gold plating and ruby sapphire emeralds galore. And the giant golden blade that turns the school into a rainbow beam blasting flying ship? That can buy North America. All the bling is pretty much all the good in this. Relatively good as that gun shield thing was pretty cool.,3434,34,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Owari no Seraph at the time of its release looked to be one of the most promising anime of its season.  The art style was lovely the animation smooth the plot full of a post-apocalyptic yet fantastical amalgamation etc.  It was set up with just about everything in its favor.  Yet it only took me two episodes for me to start really despising this show.  For all of its promise it took every creative decision it had the potential for and created the most clichéd execution.,3444,41,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't know what to say. This anime is almost perfect. I really love the op song the story and the characters. I can see how cute a guy when he's in tsundere mode (if you know what I mean),3446,42,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One day Giant Weeb Man crawled out of his garbage coated bed to reach for his TV remote. Flicking on the CRT he began rewatching his single DVD of Attack on Titan's dub for the fifth time this week. But today was different today instead of his usual huge giddy grin as Mikasa was visible on the TV he felt no joy. Glancing away from the TV to acknowledge the rat in his room eating the corpse of the rat that used to live there he sighed  MAN I really LOVE this cool and kawaii anime Attack on Titan but when's they gon' make a second season? It's been sooo long! I really want to see the conclusion of this anime that spend half of their budget on stalling only to make an incredibly abrupt ending! . The rat turned and looked at him with beady eyes and said  Hey buddy OLD pal you should watch SERAPH OF THE END because it's the exact same FUCKING SHOW . Giant Weeb Man's eyes lit up  Really? Boy time to go watch a BRAND NEW EFDSNU ANIME  he screamed as he rolled out of his lair and into the world of light. ,3447,43,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show has to take the cake for the best vampire animation I have seen to date.  It has plenty of great and memorable characters such as Krul Yuichiro Guren Shinoa Shiho and Ferid.  Why not Mikaela?  Because he is so often so focused on reuiniting with Yuichiro that it feels creepy and perhaps more than just brothers.  He does seem like a pretty strong and decent character but we never really see much or at least not enough of that to come to a strong assessment one way or the other beyond that eerie sensation that he thinks of nothing else than meeting and fleeing vampires and humans with his would be adopted/shared orphanage brother.  For this reason his character beyond the fact that he is a vampire with progenitor blood and a good sword fighter seems fairly weak and incomplete compared to essentially every other character in the series.,3448,44,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Seraph of the End story line is quite interesting. Adding it's own twist to the traditional vampire apocolypse. The characters use of 'demon' weapons also add to the feel as a whole. ,3454,48,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story - Really dull and boring. ,3455,49,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime had a ton of promise but it just tripped over so many hurdles in the execution.,3456,50,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First review so here i go .the anime is dedefinitely something you should try and see before you judge it . I really liked akame ga kill and this anime had the same feeling as akame ga kill so i enjoyed it ,3457,51,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I first heard the ending song on 8 tracks then when I was searching for good cover art for my playlist the images intrigued me.  Then I found out this was done by WIT who did attack on titan so you know I had no choice.  It was quite mediocre in all but one aspect.  I found the relationship and the drama between Yu and Mika really compelling.  Compelling enough to keep an audience long past their patience much like naruto.  The actual story action characters are all pretty cliche and dull to watch nothing like the stuff in attack on titan.  I had to fight my way through the story to get to the good stuff because I was dying to find out what happened between the two and now at episode 12 it looks like we have a similar naruto type situation where the two may meet and get seperated a hundred times before anything truly happens.  I appreciated the emotion of that meeting and I look forward to the drama in the second half.  ,3458,52,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Seraph of the End is the first vampire-related anime I've ever seen and I'm glad I did. The vampire theme usually bores me completely but the show was great.,3460,53,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I just wanted to make a quick review of this somewhat interesting series and elaborate on its good and bad points.,3461,54,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Whenever a certain product becomes popular among the masses it is guaranteed to have imitators trying to off its success. So when Attack on Titan became mainstream imitators started popping up. One of these shows is Owari no Seraph or Seraph of the End in English.,3462,55,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well this bring's a whole new fresh level to the vampire genre i've seen pretty much every Vampire anime out there and nothing bring's the level of detail and combat in Seraph of the end only Hellsing coming close even tho they only have 4 episodes (Currently) the plot and story are spot on making you want to watch more and more. Since it's early and not much to go on i'm only going off my personal expirence with the anime so far i would recommend anyone into the vampire genre to check it out.,3466,59,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Bear with me this is my first review only because I just finished this.,3467,60,2019-04-13 21:35:39
this One piece TV special was intresting because it gave us a view of what has lead to whats happening now but in a point of view different from Luffy's hence  Episode of Sabo . It is basically the Dress Rosa arc but in sabo's prespective. we see alot of unseen stuff like how sabo entred the colosuem and how he found out that Lucy was Luffy. quite intersting.,3468,61,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wow that ending was great.  I have seen this and the previous series/season (I'm not to sure what to call them exactly) before this watching but that was several years ago when it was first shown on Adult Swim and I have forgotten most of it since then so it was kinda like starting all over again on the series.  I had read somewhere that the first season was quite a bit better than R2 but I can't really see how I enjoyed them both but I believe R2 to be the better of the two.  If you haven't seen the show you really need to.,3470,63,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,3472,64,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime was just fun.  I loved how I couldn't predict the plot and in fact that's basically the only reason I watched the show.  It was a thrill ride.  Everything else about it was fine for a mecha the characters were a bit flat the script wasn't the best and the technological advancement was ridiculous but the plot blew my mind.  And the ending was just great.  This is still one of the best anime endings I've ever seen.  ,3473,65,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"Well this season of Code Geass was just awfull. It is even worse than the first season because not only were all three of the mangas just mashed together but it also lacked the story of lelouch of the rebellion from the original story. As it goes from there the animation was amazing as usual and also as of the first season the characters lacked muscle mass which made them look younger than they were ought to be. To sum up the rest of the series it was by far the worst sequel so far. The over all concept of the entire anime series just could have been just focusing on lelouch of the rebellion rather than just mashing up all three and making it an anime. ",3478,68,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is my 2nd faviorte anime of all time and If you haven't seen this show yet you need to get up and watch this show. The story is a masterpiece that will leave you hanging in ever single epiosde. The Character are so amazing in this show some are masterminds and others are not that smart. But the power of Geass would be so awesome and the 2nd season is the best between the 2 ,3479,69,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Put on your seatbelts and brace yourself for you will be taken on a rabidly-paced and concluding journey slamming through plot twists and character development at a tempo that will leave you longing for a new episode at the end of each one. Save a lot of time for this is obnoxiously addictive. This is... Code Geass: Lelouch of Rebellion... R2!,3480,70,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is the only anime that I have seen that I would rate this high it is an anime that will stay with me forever and the ending..... its the best ending I have ever seen it ais also number 1 on my list of anime I recomend that everyone watch this at least once it is the only anime that made me cry.,3499,83,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The ending is spectacular. The transition from season 1 and 2 however leaves many questions and weakens the credibility of plot progression. The characters have been firmly established by this point yet the protagonist Lelouch changes from season 1 because of dementia. Seasons 1 and 2 of Code Geass are unforgetable. Worth watching and talking about.,3501,85,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I think that is not easy to make a review of Code Geass but i'll do my best to day something the most objective possible about one of my favorite anime of all time...,3503,86,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Code Geass is my favorite anime. Season 2 is just as good as season 1. There is a great plot point in the first episode which leads to many other parts of the plot. Everything is connected and all characters are well devloped. The fanservice is kept to a much lower amount than other animes which makes it a lot more bearable than some others. The plot characters and challenges are all well thought out and the anime is good no matter how you look at it.,3507,89,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This season of Hayate the Combat butler was probably the least original and the most fresh of the series. Yes it isn't like the first seasons where the story is always laughs no stress this anime made you think and honestly I loved the whole series :3,3517,98,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,3518,99,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A vissionary fantasy masterpiece! I loved it so beautiful. Most of the time with anime music videos I either love the music or video and find the other counterpart lacking. This was a perfect hamony in music and animation. I've always liked Utada Hikaru's singing from Kingdom Hearts. She wears a dream costume dress with magical dancers and drummers in the background while an anime flowing angel-like girl keeps popping up. Very pretty and peaceful.,3519,100,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you are here for some sexy shit or some action then back off now this is a adaptation of a romance game with the same name as the show. If will not show boobs and it will not be crazy with that  attack on titan  budget as it is not for the main stream audience and is not going to be end of. Watch if you like a more slow anime with standard looks casual audio and some romance that is not going to go all  twilight  on you ok!,3522,101,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I watched this series due to the Anime Lotto Club.  Anyways I decided to review it.,3525,102,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In short this anime is about school girls experiencing minor difficulties and different experiences (e.g. concerns of weight studying learning about Japanese culture) and how their friends help them. There is no romance or action just positive relationships (mainly focused on friends rather than family). It is not the kind of anime you could watch back-to-back because each episode works well as a stand-alone story. Furthermore there is so much cuteness and positivity packed into each episode that it is quite difficult to watch two episodes in one sitting! If you were to watch an episode a day I don't think you would find it 'boring' as other reviewers have claimed (or maybe this genre doesn't really appeal to them?).,3526,103,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I use it as a way to measure my own personal enjoyment rather than the actual average. If you wanna know so bad whip out a calculator geez.,3531,107,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I have to admit it is kind of hard to absolutely love this anime.  It has way too many frivolous bits like girl bit shots for no reason and pointless gratuitous violence and bloodshed.  This maybe one of the worst or most offensive animes where girl bits are show in such shameless and purely for show kind of ways since there is no logical way they would get stripped the way they often do in the show in reality. It has alot of very uncomfortable situations as well such as the incestuous violent thug abusive rapist brother who I am sure everyone wishes was killed first and perhaps in the most nasty way ever seen in the show.  It makes even less sense how she still behaves around him or treats him as human at all let alone still talks to that monster.  Frankly the whole thing confuses the hell out of me no human being would ever in my wildest imagination act the way she does with a monster like him.  It is very uncomfortable to watch bits about her past or when her brother comes into the story at all.  His nasty ways have not simmered either as he found a new weakminded and guilable masochist to abuse.  ,3532,108,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I started this anime thinking it would be another one of those cloth ripping fighting between girls anime. It was that but also much more. There has been put time in thinking about the progression of the characters even though the clothing in this anime has the tendency to rip the same way over and over again.,3536,112,2019-04-13 21:35:39

'Freezing' is an anime that people will approach from several different angles. There are the people that will be watching for the outrageous fight scenes  and others will watch for the ample fan service. What surprised me at the conclusion of the show was that I thought back on the series as first and formost a futuristic apocalyptic tale in the same realm of subject matter as Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is a return to the subjects of a show that created a surge of more adult-themed stories and content in anime. Every rose has its thorns as the show itself says so let's delve into the components of 'Freezing.',3538,114,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have but one regret all the unnecessary fan service.  This was a good anime with lots of action and a decent story line.  I felt bad every time I saw all the unneeded fan service because it was detracting from what was going on.  I found myself watching all the episodes in one sitting.  It truly had my interest. Luckily most of the skin shots subsided toward the end as the action increased but it didn't stop completely.  It bothers me when the Directors can't trust in the storyline to maintain the watchers attention.  Despite this major flaw  which will keep a large amount of anime lovers from watching it I still recommend this series to anyone who likes action and isn't offended by unwanted fanservice.,3546,121,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The military academy in Freezing appears to only issue women's uniforms with tear-off chests.  Also the staff of Freezing would like to remind you that women have enormous breasts with nipples on the ends of them.  Also they would like to trivialize childhood sexual abuse (lolspoilers) by using it purely as a justification for why the female lead can only ever be involved with the male lead out of every other person in the world.  Well actually it doesn't explain why he's an exception to her general RAGEKILLYONOW reaction to human touch but I'm assuming that has something to do with magical protagonist powers.,3547,122,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Samurai Champloo is honestlya great animewhich is..well...great!,3565,136,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Samurai Champloo is a very fun anime.  When I think about it it is the same kind of  fun  that Black Lagoon brings or maybe Durarara.  It is episodic and I normally HATE episodic anime.  Normally anime like this crush any chance of a good story developing.  However this one didnt try to be anything more then what it was.  This made the anime awesome.  It meant to be this way and so it was easy to enjoy.  Sure there was the main story about the samurai who smells of sunflowers but it was just a bunch of entertaining small stories along the way.  It was good that way.  Like I said before this had very much the same simply fun appeal that Black Lagoon had.  Just have fun with it.  Sit back relax and enjoy the things they did well.,3566,137,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So I admit that Samurai Champloo is probably my favorite anime of all time.  In fact Samurai Champloo was the first anime I’ve ever watched in its entirety and is the primary reason I am a fan of anime today.  I disclaim this in honest admittance that I have a soft spot for this show and while I always do my best to keep my reviews objective some of my subjective love for this show is probably going to bleed through.  You’ve been warned!,3567,138,2019-04-13 21:35:39

     Samurai Champloo felt like a fresh breathe for me after watching all sorts of romance anime for the last 3 weeks. This anime focuses on 3 main characters each with their own goals. We are first introduced by Mugen a freestyle samurai or whatever you may call him. The second one is Jin a calm-looking casual samurai with an usual ronin outfit. Finally the girl Fuu who was peacefully working in a tea shop while some tough guys came in and had a fight with Mugen.,3572,143,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Very funny and very easy to watch. This is not the best anime of course and not the best storyline but the characters are realy nice and its a classic.,3576,147,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sa sa sa samurai shampoloo sorry it just says it in the middle of every episode you begin to hear it in your sleep. But I do promise your dreams will be sweet at least. Because this series is also up the top end of awesome. 3 characters Moogen an awkward roughneck with a breakdance style of fighting a swordsman who stays very quiet but has a strong distaste for Moogen then there is the girl who stands between them and they accompany each other in order to find the swordsman who smells like sunflowers...this is their epic journey. that offers all ya want from an anime. schmick as!,3577,148,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is best suited for people who don't watch anime much I've gotten quite a few friends into this who normally stay away from anime. Its really easy to jump in anywhere and enjoy. I would call this afro samurai before afro samurai. The stroy isn't that important (until the end) most episodes are stand alone. Some are wacky which is important to take all the pressure off of the action which brings me to my next point.,3581,152,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is the coolest of the cool. Samurai Champloo has a great plot. The story starts when by total accident the paths of three completely different people cross at just the right time. Wanted samurais Jin and Mugen are about to be executed when an unlikely hero a young girl named Fuu saves the day. In return she asks that the two young samurai criminals accompany her on a journey to find the samurai that smells of sunflowers. As you go with them on this journey you will laugh ALOT and sit on the edge of your seat as they battle their enemies. This show will keep you hooked from the first episode.,3582,153,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A few times in your life you stumble upon a masterpiece which makes you forget about the brain dead boring animes you have been forcing yourself to watch during the past few days... Samurai Champloo is one such anime for me. Even though there were lose ends i absolutley loved it. It is one of the precious few series in which the ending was to my liking. Though confusing and unrealistic at some points it is more than a mere  must watch .,3584,155,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was in my local dvd store in the anime section when I stumbled across this  gem  of a show. Unlike other people I bought this blind not knowing a thing about it as there was no synopsis on the back of the case. After watching the first episode I was hooked and stunned at the same time as it was rare to find an anime with such language and violence. Each episode is full of either comedy drama or action or sometimes all of the above. If you are looking for a change from your usual  teenager gains powers/skills and takes on evil  anime (e.g naruto bleach blue exorcist) then watch this blockbuster of an anime and I promise that after watching the last episode you will be begging for more as sadly there is only 26 episodes and no signs of anymore being made. I strongly suggest you watch this and you will not be dissapointed (especially if you like hip-hop music),3586,156,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ah the days of staying up past midnight to watch your one favorite anime on Toonami or Adult Swim that you would rather risk getting the smackdown from your parents than miss an episode {even if it was a rerun}… Usually your television program in shining armor would come to rescue you at a time when you just couldn’t take all of the filler TV-14 cartoons and anime anymore and you almost drift off to sleep at some hour in the morning you couldn’t wrap your little head around.,3593,159,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story - This is a pretty simple episodic adventure anime with some episodes being funny and some episodes being dramatic. Each episode has the straightforward story of all of the characters getting into some kind of trouble separately or together and then the OP samurai Jin and Mugen get them out of trouble. While this may seem predictable I was thoroughly entertained by the character's exploits throughout the whole series and the people they came across even if the fact that the two independent-seeming men joined Fuu on her journey didn't make sense to me at all (but then again this is anime logic). There was only one episode I really hated which was the zombie episode. It didn't fit in with the rest of the show was boring and so clearly AU within an already AU universe that it wasn't worth paying too much attention to. The last episode of this show made me cry multiple times which I consider to be a good thing -- *SPOILER* when Jin and Mugen had their death fake-out I was sobbing uncontrollably. I thought that the end while I was upset that each seemed to go their different ways was fitting for the series.,3597,163,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I didn't rate the story or characters because I didn't watch the whole series so I can't comment on them. The animation was pretty rigid but that's what it was going for I'm sure. I mostly couldn't get over the horrendous hip-hop and record scratching playing constantly. I even tried to watch the show without sound so I wouldn't hear that ruckus but it just kept playing in my head. The whole series is ruined by the music. Hip-hop has no place in asian anime. Period. So I can't finish the series oh well. Was pretty bored watching it anyways. You'll probably like this if you like the hippity-hop and rappedy-rap with their tweed smoking and cap busting like down-low jiggaboos. But if not you won't enjoy this. You've been warned.,3602,166,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I know everyone boasts such high praises for this movie but the STORY just really didn't do it for me.  I felt like everything was unnecessarily dramatic.  Don't get me wrong I love angst.  (I really do - sometimes my appreciation for an anime will go up if they have a tragic character death).  But it has to flow it has to feel appropriate and for me this anime just didn't have that feeling.,3626,181,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I liked 5 Centimeters per Second quit alot. It was a beutiful series that although didn't have any action in it was vary compelling. I became attached to the charicters easy and felt that this three part story was done well. The end while disappointing me [the end's of most series dissapoint me ;)] fit perfectly todether with how this story was told. I'm happy with this movie and suggest watching it.,3628,183,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It was a decent movie. I felt it was very disconnected. Although that was sort of the point. Through the space and time the two main characters remained close yet millions of miles away from each other. it is a very realistic story and for that I think it was good. It was not exactly my cup of tea but was good none the less. The sadness reaches me on a personal level that I think most people can relate to and that is what makes this story touching and beautiful. But the sadness also leaves a depressing taste in my mouth. It is however thought provoking and breaks traditional models of modern mainstream anime. ,3635,187,2019-04-13 21:35:39

5 Centimeters per Second was the first contact i had with Makoto Shinkai's work and i was completly blown away with it. I never though i could see such beautiful scenary with something that is animated rather than 3D. It's safe to say i became a fan of Mr. Shinkai since that moment (at the time of this review i already saw the majority of his work but 5 Cm has a close space in my heart).,3640,192,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I didn't know what to expect from 5 cm per second. From the trailer I knew that I was about to be blown away by the animation and get treated to a love story. To what end I had no idea but here on the other side I am somewhat glad I decided to sit down with the film.,3649,200,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"A few Otakons ago I was sitting in the AMV contest like I do every year. I remember tapping my foot impatiently awaiting the Humor category which they always save for last. Even though I primarily watch for the humor category I do like to vote in the contest honestly; so I pay close attention to all the videos in every category. Drama is not my favorite AMV category but one video in particular caught my eye that year. And while I’ve long since forgotten the title and content of the AMV I remember voting for it and the name of the series it came from has been stuck in my mind since. 5 Centimeters Per Second is a title that kind of pops at out you. And while my action-addicted brain immediately conjures up images of speeding mecha at the title 5CM/Sec is actually an incredibly beautiful slice-of-life romance anime movie that I’ve been meaning to watch since that AMV contest. I finally decided that enough was enough and I watched what has to be the best anime movie I’ve ever seen. Now just so we’re clear that last statement is a matter of opinion and it’s affected by two things. One I actually don’t watch a lot of anime movies. I mostly enjoy long-running series that involve lots of punching and stabbing. Two and I’m being honest here I’m not the biggest Studio Ghibli fan. I’ve enjoyed maybe two or three of their films and the most recent one was Princess Mononoke. So before you ask no I didn’t like Howl’s Moving Castle. It’s a great movie and I can see why people do like it (though it has a scary cult following that I’ll never get) but it just wasn’t for me. So when I say 5CM/Sec is the best anime movie I’ve ever seen it means that in the humble opinion of someone who doesn’t worship at Miyazaki’s feet this is the best damn anime movie I’ve managed to see yet. With that out of the way let’s move on to the part of the review that won’t get me stabbed in the parking lot by hardcore Howl fans. 5CM/Sec is the story of two friends Akari and Takaki who have deeply loved each other since elementary school but grow apart as their parent’s jobs separate them. As they get older they struggle to move on from one another. Takaki in particular finds himself unable to appreciate his present life and the people around him leaving the advances of high school friend Kanae to go unnoticed. The movie is broken down into three parts. The first Cherry Blossom establishes the two elementary school students and through flash backs reveals how they became close friends. This “episode” mostly chronicles the final time they got to see each before Takaki’s family moved too far away for the friends to visit. It’s a bittersweet story of young love left unfulfilled. The story is told mostly through their letters to each other which serves as the narration. The second episode Cosmonaut is generally narrated from the point-of-view of Kanae a girl attending Takaki’s new school. This episode is set primarily in high school where Takaki joins the archery team but never seems truly focused on his present life. The third episode 5 Centimeters Per Second is narrated from Takaki’s view of his adult life and the unfulfilling job and relationship he has. This section also has an incredibly moving montage to the song “One More Time One More Chance” by Yamazaki Masayoshi. The sectioning of the movie into three episodes is an interesting way to keep the pace steady. For someone who watches a lot of action and comedy anime I was worried that anime without stabbing and humorous anecdotes would bore the bejeezus out of me. But somehow thanks to the pacing and the sporadic flashbacks it keeps the movie lively with at least one scene in Cherry Blossom having me at the edge of my seat. I love the way it breaks things down. You’d need a whole TV series to cover the events of these kids’ lives and that would be hella boring. Instead we get little time skips with a few quick flashbacks to get up to speed and incredible backgrounds to identify the changed settings. It doesn’t overwhelm you with information about the time and place and situations the movie just eases them into narration or scenery very naturally. The animation of the movie is first-rate. There’s a certain realistic quality to it and everything from scenery to objects to vehicles are given such fine detail that it’s shockingly lifelike (without being one those CGI Advent Children kind of things). From the tatami on the floor of Takaki’s room and the tiny rust stains around bolts on the walking plates between train cars it’s truly a wonder what a movie budget can do for animation compared to a TV series. It’s a little unfortunate that with all that beautiful realism in every scene that the style of the characters themselves seem a little simplistic. Character faces never seem too detailed or intense or as expressive as they could be unless it’s a close-up. But that at least is more than made up for by the incredible voice acting. Kondou Yoshimi shines in her very first voice role lending a cute melancholy to young Akari. Kondou is using her natural voice so her narrations in Cherry Blossom come out sounding so well natural. Since there’s no over-the-top action and yelling out of “Super Kickass Attack of Explosive Death!” all of the precious few voices that are in it all sound like someone talking in the same room as you. If the people in the same room as you were narrating their lives in Japanese. Onoue Ayaka (adult Akari) and Mizuhashi Kenji (Takaki) are also newcomers to voice-acting scene but have each had a few parts in some Japanese horror flicks. Mizuhashi’s young Takaki is good but his adult Takaki voice isn’t really that different which takes away from the fact that there was supposed to be a passage of time. Since Akari’s seiyuu changed for part three getting a more mature voice for the older character was simple and Onoue did a great job matching the gentle speech Kondou used in part one. Kanae’s voice actress is Hanamura Satomi who has some voice acting experience in anime but no leading roles to her name. Despite the lack of experience of the cast in general they did a great job. There were two English dubs of 5CM/Sec. The first was done by ADV and when they discontinued their release the original Japanese distributer requested a redub from Bang Zoom! Entertainment for release on Crunchyroll.com as part of a small celebration commemorating Director Shinkai Makoto’s works. The Bang Zoom! release appears to have been removed from the website by now but I did have the chance to hear ADVs dub. Hilary Haag (Tess in Fullmetal Panic Hitomi in Appleseed) as Akari makes me cringe a little. I’ve never really been a fan of Haag’s though her role as Rosette in Chrno Crusade gets a rare thumbs-up from me. Haag is one of those voice actresses that I think kind of sound the same in every role she does and 5CM/Sec is no exception. While her voice passes for young Akari in the first part of the movie it fails to achieve believable adulthood for her brief appearance in part three. Her voice is just unnaturally high which is fine if you’re trying to sound like the Japanese but not so good when you’re trying to do something in English that commands realism. The opposite is true for David Matranga (Sanzo in Saiyuki Orphen in Sorcerous Stabber Orphen) whose adult Takaki voice is great but seems to flounder as young Takaki. His voice obviously can’t go as high as it needs to in order to sound like schoolboy so it kills that realism of the character. Both VAs seem okay with the narration of the show but it doesn’t feel quite as natural as their Japanese counterparts. The narration is quiet and gentle but coming from those two it feels somewhat forced especially in part one. For all of my dissatisfaction with his young Takaki Matranga’s adult Takaki is wonderful. His narration of part three is soft and bitter and his voice conveys both the character’s emptiness in his life and discontent he feels because of it. But the one who really seems to have this movie down though is Serena Varghese (Rosetta in Kaleido Star Yuma & Yuna in Pani Poni Dash) who plays Kanae in part two. Varghese actually comes off as sounding natural both in part two’s narration and dialog and it really goes a long way in helping the audience to sympathize with the character. But casting and animation aside what makes 5CM/Sec such an interesting movie is how easy it is to relate to. I think everyone has had something in their life that has gone unfulfilled some wish they could never make true or some precious words they never told the right person. Some people move on and forget about the past but many people linger on the “coulda shoulda woulda.” During the big montage in the third part the lyrics reflect the melancholy of the show so well it’s heartbreaking. The movie is great at showing how time distance and speed have different meanings to different people. Two people living cities apart can be closer than two people sitting next to each other. For some people the future is a beautiful mystery worth exploring and to others it’s just more of the same boring present. For some time flies by and before you know it you’ve missed your chance and for others it trudges on so slowly that it feels like nothing will ever progress. The whole movie is a poignant reflection of our own human hopes and faults. 5CM/Sec is a must-see for the artistically-inclined fans. The beauty of the animation alone makes it worthwhile kind of like James Cameron’s Avatar but without blue cat-people and a recycled story. For the action fans who can’t watch a show unless someone is getting punched/kicked/stabbed/killed by a ninja/death god/bounty hunter/demon/giant robot the movie might seem boring (people with ADD might want to go watch Excel Saga instead). But if you’re one of those artsy types who likes a deep meaningful movie to talk about over coffee 5CM/Sec won’t disappoint. ﻿",3652,201,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Not trying to bash the creators of this anime I won't lie I could see where the love of this anime is. But to me possibly because I don't have the experience in a  long-distance  relationship I did not like the story. Nothing was solved and it all repeated back as a dream that never happened. I was really disappointed to see it end the way it did and it felt almost like a waste of time. I was hoping for many points of the story to be solved. Again not trying to bash the creators but just putting my honost opinion down.,3653,202,2019-04-13 21:35:39

There is not much I can say about  5 Centimeters per Second  other than I rather enjoyed it.  Lasting about an hour and being comprised of three short stories I did not start this expecting alot but it surprised me.  Before I go any further I should say that if you are looking for an adventure or something with amazing action sequences keep looking this is far from that.  In my opinion  5 Centimeters per Second  was emotion in colour there were no conflicts just life not tragic but sometimes a little sad.  I felt for the characters and grew attached because I could relate to what they are going through having experiences like these in my own life.  The animation was probobly the best I have seen so far (excluding Pixar's works of course) and the sound fit perfectly with what was happening to make for a very immersive story.... err stories.  If you want to forget about life for awhile you no longer have to go see Billy Joel just pop this in.,3671,214,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sad reality. Two words that sumarize this anime movie for me. Three different stories about unpredictible conditions of love and sorrow. I've been traveling 4 hours by train to see one important girl living far away from me. Then I watched 5CpS maybe an year later. The feels approached my kokoro swiftly and mercilessly. I really wanted to see that girl again but she hardly remembered me after the year passed. But this was mine story and I'm glad where I am now. I watched 5CpS till the end with my eyes heart and mouth opened. Even now I'm amazed how beautiful this movie is. And you really should watch this too! ;),3675,218,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Episode 1 and 2 were well made with nice slow paced character development between Tono and Akari. Reaching Episode 3 the hard working Tono suddenly changes and becomes a loser sobering over losing contact with Akari. The story gets rushed new characters got introduced but thats it nothing more was told. In the end we learns that he moves on from Akari after seeing the cherry blossom falling like their promise. At first I was confused at why everyone was saying it was a good ending. I read explainations about it's realism and that life moves on for everyone whether we like it or not. However the juxtaposition of Tono's state from the beginning of Episode 3 to the end was just too drastic not even normal people can come in terms with their feelings that quickly let alone that person being Tono who sobered for over 10 freaking years.,3676,219,2019-04-13 21:35:39

So i just randomly picked a title from my crunchyroll list and happend to come across 5 Centimeters Per Second. I enjoyed the beginning up untill about the 55 minute mark. Now this could possibly contain spoilers so you've been warned. I felt as if the resolution of the movie was going nowhere. Maybe it's just a missed concept that i happened to overlook. maybe i'm at fault. Alas. The song at the end absolutely killed it for me. The fact that there ultimately was no resolution and that i was left to interpret the whole rest of their lives. really bugged me. Maybe it's because i'm a romantic maybe it's because the character growth was very well done. But i felt like the ending took away exactly what i had grown to like about the characters i dunno. maybe i'm just dumb. ,3680,221,2019-04-13 21:35:39

5 Centimeters Per Second. This anime film was a spur of the moment download one evening after reading a review about it on anime-access.com and then seeing parts of the movie in an AMV on YouTube. I typed a quick Google query in about it and browsed the Wikipedia article before downloading then transcoding it for my iPod Touch. 5 Centimeters Per Second is divided into 3 parts: Cherry Blossom Cosmonaut and 5 Centimeters Per Second so my plan of attack here is to watch each part individually give my thoughts in a paragraph or so and then sum it all up at the end.,3684,224,2019-04-13 21:35:39

5 Centimetres per Second AKA Byousoku 5 Centimetre is a short 1 hour movie about... well. It’s easy to say drama and romance but neither are depicted like traditional anime of those genres. This is a very laid back unique and potentially emotional story. One for those with mature tastes not everyone will like the ambiguity the scenes can be difficult to interpret. This movie is like a flower some folks would look at it and realise how lovely it is while others will remain uninterested and won’t see it’s appeal. I’d definitely recommend this movie a must watch to anybody whether you watch anime or not. Though if you like action-packed shounen full of plot progression and/or comedy this won’t be your cup of tea. I will say that I enjoy the chilled-out unique realistic anime and these anime I would label as a sub-genre I made up myself I call ‘realistic.’ Though it doesn’t necessarily mean exactly that.,3686,226,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Depressing. That's what this was. Depressing and nothing else. I didn't learn anything from this I didn't get any enjoyment out of this all that happened was I watched a protagonist fall deeper and deeper into depression because of his life circumstances. ,3692,230,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A fun sports anime in the play-to-win vein of Akagi and Kaiji -heseuys want to win so much it hurts. Hagiwara Masato the seiyuu whooiced both Kaiji and Akagi turns in yet another great performance asne Out's protagonist Kokuchi which also solidifies the link betweenhe other two series. However whilene Outs is incredibly clever at times the experience feels shallowompared to what was done in the series One Outs seems to be imitating.aiji and Akagi both had darker undertones that don't have nearly asuch bite in One Outs. Also the series becomes very formulaic near thend almost to the point of ridiculousness. There's only so manymprobable situations that Tokuchi can wriggle out of before therocess stops being exciting and just gets tiring.,3724,244,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is a true beast. The subtitle of the series couldn't be more accurate:''Nobody wins but I!''This is the life motto of our protagonist the one and the only Toua Tokuchi.,3726,245,2019-04-13 21:35:39
With a sense of nonsense ufotable brings us a piece of art in animation that reminds me the sense of humor of the 1990's Cartoon Network. The plot is simple: Trolldad trolls daughter. The settings: Penguins per kilo. The rest can be deducted easily.

This was my very first introduction into the world of Manga and Anime and no matter what other anime's ive watched Fruits basket has and probably always will be one of my favorites. The main character Tohru Honda is the only character that i dislike somewhat. She seems too shy and her overall character annoys me BUT the story revolves around that personality. The other characters like Kyo and Yuki are possibly the best part of the story with their opposite personalities a girl can pick which guy she likes better without being stuck with just one main male character. Each Character has deeper parts to their personalities that are revealed to the viewer with each new episode and it really draws them in. The story line of the Fruits Basket Anime was excellent despite nothing really wrapping up at the end. For the most part it just ends with everyone looking happy stopping basically right in the middle of the story. There are some parts they could work on for the anime (like making a second season...hint hint) but it really is very good.,3731,249,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The reason why I loved this concept it was a mixture or reality fantasy and comedy. Although people turned into animals it was relatable. I highly recommend this anime. I was just sad at the ending there could be so much more.,3734,250,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a soso anime. It has a good plot/story line to it but sometimes it may be a little bit confusing but it is still really good. I like most of the characters in this anime because most of them are really cool but others I wish would just go die in a hole and never come back. I also like that they can change in to the 12 zodiac and the cat. The sound of the aime is okay. Sometimes the music can drown out the voices of the characters but other than that it is still really good. The animation of the anime is really good considering that it was made in 2001.,3735,251,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,3736,252,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Overall this is a great anime.  It has an unusual plot with humans turning into the zodiac animals and is a slice-of-life type anime with that twist.  The animation is clean and I noticed no sound issues.  I liked the majority of voice actors cast (dub).  The characters in this series are fantastic.  There's so many different players that you're bound to find someone you like if you stick around long enough.  It is one of those  renaissance  anime where they cover everything - you laugh you cry you hate and you love.  It's absolutely worth a try; if you're not into it after the first couple of episodes don't worry about it.  It's starts out light and airy and sends you through a series of emotions; it finishes with a dark cloud albeit it a happy enough ending (the manga goes on past the anime which is why they did this - there's more to the story).  There are a dozen characters you'll miss out on if you give up early (and even halfway) but if you can't stand Tohru the main character you'll be miserable the whole time.  You have to tolerate her to get to the good stuff.  =]  All in all I like and reccomend it if slice-of-life is your style.,3737,253,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series covers the first 6 books of the manga which is by far the best part of the series and before the quality starts to drop. Great story and a good way to get introduced to the mangs honestly you could watch this series and pick up the manga starting at book 7 if you have trouble reading yourself into loving a plot.,3738,254,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'll just come right out and say it: I hated this anime and I really wished I didn't waste my time watching it. I wanted to see what all the hype was about since I love Shoujo and my sister was a huge fan...but she didn't tell me the anime was terrible in comparison to the manga (but they both pretty much suck). You would think that with all the merchandise they sell they would make a second season to 'fix' some of the suck and give it a real plot line with some romance fluffed in.,3743,255,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The most interesting aspect of this anime is the way the characters are portrayed. Most of the scenes with more than *one* person around will be enough to wrestle you to the floor laughing or play with your emotions like a diabolical programmer on late night shift. Tooru is a little like the typical anime schoolgirl - sweet not very bright but always cheery and is a big help around the house. Much of the focus of the story is how she slowly changes the lives of those around her especially the Souma family. You see it's not all fun and games being an animal. The Soumas are unable to have relationships with  outsiders  because of their secret and as a result are withdrawn from society. Many episodes deal with the internal struggles that each one of them has - not being accepted by others because of their appearances or actions. Yet each of them finds hope in Tooru who is ready to accept them and helps them to change themselves for the better.,3744,256,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I have mixed feelings for this anime. It stays pretty close to the manga but I didn't like that the story  was changed a bit. Plus I feel like they could have continued and went with the story line. I LOVE the manga series so I was disappointed with the anime version.,3745,257,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love fruits basket though I haven't read the manga it is on my list simply because I loved the anime so much. The characters are diverse and interesting. The art is kind of cutesy but still good and works for the story. The music is good. The plot is interesting and takes turns that are sometimes expected and one time in particular not expected. The only problem I have with it really is the ending. It seemed like a scrapped together partial ending (they do wrap things up) but not a full ending of full resolution for all characters and plot twists. Maybe the manga goes further down the road and like ouran they change it to fit into the anime series rather than let it all play out as it did in the manga. This is my hope as I have it on my to read list. Other than wanting more resolution from the ending I enjoyed the series and have watched it many times. Its sweet and the love interest is more innocent than passionate but I think it really fits. It seems like a love triangle in the beginning but that seems to slowly fade into an obvious answer towards the end though that isn't as clear as I would like either. Although it does leave you with some questions at the end it is worth watching if you are in the mood for a sweet kind of quiet less showy anime. Everyone turning into animals when they get hugged is super cute though especially the zodiac bunny and sheep.,3747,258,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Another brilliant anime AND manga beautiful and imaginative storyline the characters all have these connections making it so wonderful to watch the romance between the characters and the pure emotion behind them makes it a delight. The humor is wonderful the characters are inspiring especially Tohru who manages to put a brave face on everything and I lov how Kyo and Yuki learn to put there feelings for each other aside and to just help Tohru through the difficult times. THUMBS UP!!!,3752,261,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Fruits Basket is one of those anime that I've seen once but I'd watch again for one character (he's only in a few episodes).  I know a lot of people love this anime but I honestly don't know why.  It's a little immature and I guess the majority of the audience is 14 years old or younger.,3754,262,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,3755,263,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Typically I dont really go for this particular style of anime but there is no denying how much I enjoyed Fruits Basket. The concept of acceptance by ones self and by others really got to me and I found this anime to have a really deep meaning behind it. It has the perfect blend of comedy fantasy and drama and I really enjoyed the characters and their unique personalities. The story behind it though one that has been told before brings with it a unique perspective. The story of the foolish traveller the momiji tells in episode eleven had me thinking for ages and I really like how Fruits Basket made me think. ,3757,264,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Fruit basket is a well done anime the story is relatable even though people turn into animals. The story develops the characters well and kept me wanting more. A great anime I would recommend.,3763,270,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The STORY of Fruits Basket is a cliched slice-of-life with an interesting Zodiac twist which I quite enjoyed.  While in my humble opinion the manga is far superior to the anime the anime presented itself in a decent 26 episode way that would make me give the story a hard  rating.  But in Fruits Basket it's not the story that keeps the viewer reeled in.,3764,271,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One of the things I love the most about the anime is actually the theme song. The tone meaning and all of it just touched me. Although I am a bit unsatisfied that the ending of the anime wasn't actually clear but the story itself was quite good. One of the characters I love is actually Momiji. He was just so cute but there were also his moments of wisdom. Once in the anime he was talking about his past to Tohru and that just brought me to tears!,3765,272,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Over the years people have told me that there are two series that are must see  that involve people transforming into animals via somenusual means: Ranma 1/2 and Fruits Basket. I first got into the formeritle years ago had the opportunity to read the entire run of theanga and even wrote several fanfics that inspired original charactersho I still use today. Fruits Basket didn't come until this past yearhen I bought vol. 1 of the manga from a friend and got the animeeries for Christmas (which didn't get watched until this past week).n all honesty I had thought that there were a lot more than 26pisodes. For that number here's how everything breaks down:,3782,279,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't know how to start this review because Fruits Basket is very special to me and I don't want to seem overly harsh.  So let me clarify--the structural story characters and development of Fruits Basket is defined by the manga.  The anime took severe liberties and shifted the entire focus to a far less poignant theme.,3783,280,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Fruits basket was the first manga I ever read and is still my favourite so I was excited to find it was an anime too thought I was a little disapointed with a few missing subplots that were in the manga. But it was a great series too and has added two very hilarious episode with Uo-chan and Hana-chan visiting Shigure's house I feel like this anime needs a second series.,3785,282,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The very first series that I read as a manga and got me into anime (: I love this anime. Mainly what got to me was the animals and I love all animals. But this anime had almost everything in it. Comedy Romance Tragedy Slife of Life School Life etc. It was just amazing. The anime was so great and I loved the characters and how they perfectly portrayed which animal they were of the Zodiac. ,3786,283,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I had been putting Fruits Basket off for a while (not completely sure why) and I finally got around to it. I can definitely say that I enjoyed the off-beat humor romantic tension and unique story driving the series. There was an extremely wide array of personalities portrayed throughout the series as well. Anywho I shall get along with the actual review.,3800,289,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So much I love about this anime. Well when I fist found out about anime planet this was one of my first anime to watch I think it was the second. I'm in love with each characters. They are so funny. I would say Momijy <--- I think thats how you spell it. Well I think that he has one of the biggest heart and his words just get to me he is so full of hope. I also love Tohru she is a very nice girl but sometimes she can be to nice and it can get annoying. Another of my favoret caracter is Shigure. He is so funny he always brings a smile on my face. The whole anime overall is very funny and really good. Sometimes the sory would be kind of low pace I think but its stile a good anime.,3801,290,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Fushigiboshi no futagohime was goodbut it seemed like it was the same as any other anime. You know how something wrong is happens and the main charater uses their power to save the world yeah... What was pretty good was that the animation and sound fitted well into the story. After a while you kinda get bored of it but it is good. If you're looking for a magical girl anime with a little bit of romance than you should watch it ! :),3810,297,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When I first decided to start watching this I had expected the show to be something like a harem which wouldn't have been a necessarily bad thing but the show probably would have taken a major blow as a result.  But then as the show started to get underway I noticed something that it was in fact not a harem at all really that instead the show was a collection of mini-arcs all focusing on one guy during a certain span of his life with one specific girl and that at the end of each arc things started over and it was the same guy and a different girl within that same span of time but the only difference being that he never had a real romantic relationship with any of the other girls.  Each arc I found to have both its strong points as well as its weak points but the one thing that remained true for most of the arcs is that they in my opinion had more development and the male lead and lead female than some other series have with a full 24-26 episodes.  Which I found to be quite a pleasant thing since I'm a huge fan of a good romance.  The animation was pretty good it didn't do anything that could be considered new or amazing but it was nowhere near bad either.  The sound was pretty good as well and besides the opening and ending none of background music within the series made any lasting impressions or were even noticeable for that matter.  The charactes really is where this series is at its strongest.  With the male lead being for the most part the same throughout the entire series you either like him or hate him or end up somewhere inbetween.  It really comes down to the female leads that really make this series strong.  Between all six girls a person is sure to pick out at least one or two favorites among them with each girl really playing to a certain taste.  Overall I really rather enjoyed the series and may actually end up watching a couple of the arcs at some point in time.,3811,298,2019-04-13 21:35:39
All right this will be my first review but did i have to mention that.,3812,299,2019-04-13 21:35:39
For me this show was an unusual yet welcome concept. Take 6 girls 1 guy and tell a love story for each pairing separately through the same year of the guy's life. At first I was thinking that the progression was extremely fast for a 25 ep show but as I figured out later it was more akin to 6 4-5 ep shows based on the same characters. If you still don't understand what I mean read the whole review and then post below if you're still confused.,3813,300,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I love this show. 'Why?' you might ask becuase it is such a calm and soothing experience whilst still being able to grasp an audience. Comparions can be made to many series and to be fair these are mainly correct but I feel that Amagami SS is it's own beast. You can see this through the beautiful sound-track and great character design. Watching this show around christmas is perfect and I couldn't ask for a better christmas harem. Speaking of the harem. I feel that it is handeld very well with each girl getting around four episodes allowing for the viewer to decide who truly is BEST GIRL. I have always preffered this approach in all seriouness as it allows for the idea of other love intrests to be explored more deeply as in some shows BEST GIRL doesn't win.,3818,303,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I AM NOT HAPPY! This anime gah! Spoilers galore here so you have been warned. I believe this anime was based of a gal game. So we have 3 or 4 episodes where he falls in love with a girl something stops them from getting together they fix it and they get together and have happily ever after. Fine great I really liked it untill... Rihoko Sakurai. Where her ending is mabye he might fall in love with her. Now I would have been happy if that had happened and they had a 10 years later like some of the others and they had gotten together. But no the ONLY girl he doesn't get with is the girl who is  chunky  who looks just like every freaking one else. I would have been fine if she was one of a few that he just stayed best friends with but no she is the only one he doesn't get with. So this anime is saying everyone can find love from the girl who is abusive to the crazy chick that stalks you for years but if you're fat no love for you! If it haddn't been for this part of the story I probably would have given it 4 and a 1/2 stars but it has now been knocked down to two because of this.,3819,304,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you don't know where you're from then you don't know where you are and you don't know where you're going. It's a fairly trite adage but like most old sayings there's an element of truth to it. When it comes to visual media though such sentiments seem to go out of the window across the fields and off into the wild blue yonder especially where adaptations are concerned.,3823,308,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Rozen Maiden Traumend is the continuation of the prequel Rozen Maiden. It starts off with Shinku regretting the demise Suigintou and thinking about what she will do when the Alice game starts. Meanwhile the appearance of the final two dolls sets in motion the final pieces to which the Alice game needs to begin.,3832,315,2019-04-13 21:35:39
For the most part it’s just like it’s first season lots ofandomness. The last 3 episodes were the best part and then the ending gave me sad face… damn After Story ending sadface damnit. Was somewhat decent tillhat occurred. Suiginto was by far my favorite in both seasons.,3833,316,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series starts where the previous season/series ended.  There is an intriguing network of interconnected events woven together like a spider web that culminate in the final episode.  What you are left feeling from it maybe a bit convoluted and up for debate.,3834,317,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is one of those age old classics - Manga vs Anime. I got the manga for Christmas before I checked out the anime and I just could not stand the differences. At all. It's such a good story makes me sad to rate it so low when it isn't terrible. But the differences between it and the manga made my stomach ache and made me want to Hulk out smashing my fist through the screen....,3837,320,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: We are immediately introduced to our protagonist Aikawa Ayumu who is a zombie and the necromancer who raised him Hellsythe Eucliwood (or Yuu as she's deminuitively named throughout the show). We learn very early on why he is a zombie (he was murdered) and why Yuu raised him (because he was nice to her). We quickly meet Haruna the overconfident panties-flashing magical girl. However for some reason Ayumu gains Haruna's powers and hilarious outfit and has to become a magical girl as well. Compete with frilly pink dress and panties which we see a lot of leading one to believe he doesn't have much downstairs. At some point we are introduced to Seraphim (a.k.a. Sera) a vampire ninja who has generically huge tits and Tomonori another vampire ninja who is initially mistaken for a dude. So with our array of satirically generic characters the plot begins! Intially it's the 'who murdered Ayumu' saga followed by the 'generic monster of the week' saga followed by the 'fanservice' saga and concluded by the 'Yuu's problems' saga. All of which are swiftly resolved by a man in a dress and panties. So the satire and the clear mocking of the genre bring the score up but the overall generic-ness bring it down.,3838,321,2019-04-13 21:35:39

So within the first couple of minutes in the show we get to see the male lead get hit by a truck and sent flying at which point he calmly mentions that he is in fact a zombie.  Now then not many anime of the anime that I have seen have ever really started out like that.  So needless to say that after that rather interesting introduction I was quite interested in seeing how exactly the series would develop.  What followed was something that while it may not have been the greatest thing ever it was certainly fairly entertaining in its own right.  I mean there was just so much to take in with this series.  With everything from vampire ninjas a nercomancer and even having Ayumu(the male lead) becoming a magical girl(boy) and fighting monsters.  Which needless to say that the transformation sequence was fairly distrubing.  Will the plot is far from the greatest thing I've ever seen it does its job in keeping the viewer entertained.  With about the first half of the series dealing with Ayumu's death by some mysterious sword wielding serial killer and then the second half dealing with a different but related problem to the first.  While as I said it isn't the greatest thing ever there's enough there to entertain just about anyone.  The animation overall is fairly polished.  Though Ayumu's numerous death scenes are all highly entertaining to watch.  The sound was okay.  I didn't care much for the opening or ending and the soundtrack that played throughout the episode was nothing amazing.  As for the voice acting I overall enjoyed and didn't have any problems with them.  The characters while they were no where near original or remarkable for that matter.  I still liked them.  And it was amusing to watch the interaction between the main characters.  Whether that be Ayumu constantly seeing Eucliwood as a little sister in somewhat perverted sense watching as Haruna as she comes to fall for Ayumu or even watching as Seraphim constantly verbally abuse Ayumu.  Overall Kore wa Zombie desu ka? won't be an anime that everyone will enjoy but still I'm sure that anybody who enjoys a parody comedy with a good amount of ecchi thrown in will enjoy it.,3840,323,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series grabs you in as soon as you start it’s is highly entertaining and a funny series to watch. I however watched it for the story element which is something I should've done. It was dull for me to say the least. The series scratched a bit on the characters background and the information I got really didn't seem like nothing new for me. Just a mix-up of a few random things I could’ve mindlessly come up with in my sleep.,3842,325,2019-04-13 21:35:39

 As you can see I did not give a rating to the story I could simply could not do that because I personally found that this anime is hard to give a definite score. I mean come on a how many zombie masou shoujos do you see?... personally 5. Leaving that aside the anime consists of episodes that are a mix of comedy and emotion with either one missing this anime would be half as good as it was. I enjoyed the voice acting it fitted each character well enough and the bgm was quite good I personally diliske to opening but enjoy the end songs. If consider watching this anime it is very much about opinion and I would recommend it.,3848,331,2019-04-13 21:35:39

their is a huge difference in the english sub and the english dub. I first watched the english sub and in the dub the jokes were a lot more sexual. for example in the sub during one of Ayumu's fantasies in the sub eucliwood would say that shw wont eat the food seraphim made but in the dub she would ask if ayumu would want to eat her.,3859,336,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is easily the least consistant series this season and probably the least consistant series from the last few seasons as a whole. It's very common in this series to go from a hilarious episode to a very serious episode with a decent story to an episode... that was just terrible. Overall this series is a mixture of comedy several generally distinct genres raised to an absurb level (vampire ninjas? really?!) a bit of plot and a lot of ecchi scenes and shots. The comedy mainly comes from the parody in the form of over the top genre benders.,3861,337,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I feel like I would of enjoyed the series more if a majority of the women in this hadn't been insufferable and for more reason then one. I liked the concept well enough guy accidently gets magical girl type powers that's a interesting idea that I didn't see in too many other shows. Suffice to say I couldn't get over the girls in this anime and didn't even have a patience or anything to finish the series. I liked the chainsaw weapon that was cool and the necromancer Eucliwood was okay she didn't bother me nearly as much as the others and actually I thought she was cool. The theme was cool I rather enoyed it as a matter of fact!,3866,340,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Genius Pary is a strange anime. This was a very deliberate choice made by Studio4°C as they gave the seven independant teams total freedom with the goal of being  avant-garde . The product is seven unrelated short 10-20 minutes long pieces with truly huge differences in style content and quality. The work is difficult to evaluate and this isn't supposed to be a review as much as a piece of information to help you decide if you want to watch it. I didn't like it at all however I can easily see someone else loving it.,3874,345,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is one of the first tv shows anime or otherwise that has actually made me cry during every single episode. I started watching expecting it to be like a lot of other anime in the same genre is and I was absolutely shocked by what I saw in a good way. Rather than just tugging on your heart strings this one rips them out mercilessly. Overall I think that this anime is a great one that It'd be a real shame to skip over. My only complaint is that we didn't get to see how things ended up say 5 or 10 years later. Not a major issue for me but I still wish I could know.,3886,357,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The first half of this OVA seems like an alternate reality extra but in truth the events of this OVA occur between episode 10 and 11 so try and watch it between them if you can. The first half of this OVA while not terrible felt kind of pointless. But the latter half really shines through and provides some much needed backstory with some flashback. And that latter half is what makes this worth watching. I don't really need to say more. Though minor spoilers concerning one name that is mentioned. This OVA is also only in Japanese so subtitles are a must.,3902,367,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Even though I just started watching anime and I'm not as far as I should be to write a review. I still thought I should put out that I loved this and would recommend it to everyone.

Code Geass truly is a masterpiece anime due to the uniqueness and lovability of the characters and the depth of the storyline.  Unlike Death Note a very similar anime Code Geass takes a much lighter tone but as a whole not any less serious.  What I find most entertaining about this anime is that both Lelouch and Suzaku are trying to change the world and do the right thing but must go a route that is not necessarily right.  As a result neither one of these characters can be classified as the true antagonist.  It is also interesting when a character's greatest weapon is not his fists or his sword but his mind.  You will never get tired of seeing how the story is going to play out and what the consequences of the characters' actions will be.,3911,374,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was a very good story until it jumped the shark.  The one person he claimed he would never hurt and he picks such a thing to joke about and condemns her to such a future totally contradicts everything revealed about his character up to that point and he makes it worse by using it to his advantage rather than feel or express a reasonable level of guilt.  Through out the series he is portrayed as a good guy fighting for a good cause and for the most part avoiding any collateral damage.  He is tricky and clever.  After the tragedy with his sister Euphemia then it no longer matters who wins since both of them now represent an evil cause.  It is usually not a good idea to leave the viewers with absolutely NO ONE too either root for or identify with and this story is a very good example.  Sure humans have regrets and make mistakes but the one this character makes goes way above and beyond reason compared to anyone else.  Though I know sometimes characters goals or views or what not changes turning against his best friend as a result sort of spoils the whole point of portraying them either as friends or ever helping each other.  In fact the whole reason people sided with him was because he tried to avoid harming anyone innocent or on his side and yet he throws that away as if it never meant anything and does so way to easily and quickly for any reasonable belief.  If they portrayed his character differently or more selfish or more arrogant or more unstable then it might be believed or even expected but coming from the character they built up kind of ruins the entire story from episode 1 to 23.  He was actually sorry expressed some degree of guilt shame and regret and even reluctance after realizing the after math of the battle on the mountain where one of his followers lost relatives.  It is a bit offensive to claim someone can change so completely in a story if you know how to write a good one with so little reason to cause it.  ,3912,375,2019-04-13 21:35:39

He is a mastermind for his age and smarter then anyone in real life by far. The story is very good to you need to watch this show now now i say or write a review,3914,377,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Though this review may be quite a bit biased seeing as how I quite simply loved this anime.  So if you're looking for a completely honest review of this anime that doesn't overlook any flaws though I don't think it had any that this anime may have had.  Then you may want to look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for a review of this anime that is written by someone who completely loves it then look no further.  By the time the first episode comes to an end you are left with a desire a desire to see what exactly it is that Lelouch does with this power that he has recieved. Will he use his power for his own personal gains?  Will he use his powers to change the world?  These where the questions I had when I had finished the first episode and I knew at that moment that I was going to fall in love with this anime.  The story from there follows Lelouch on his journey as he fights with Britiania so that he can create a more gentle world for his sister Nunnally as well as tiring to find who it was exactly that killed his mother.  Though all of this would be rather difficult for a high school student and as such Lelouch creates the masked figure Zero who leads a rebellion against Britiania with the aid of the Black Knights.  I found it extremely difficult to have any problems with the story though as I said I'm a huge fan of the show so that's not really all that surprising.,3916,379,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I shouldn't have to do this I really shouldn't but the internet's rampant hipsterism has forced my hand*. Just because Code Geass is popular that doesn't mean it sucks** any more than AIDS being rare makes it great. This is one of those anime where the animation does match the overall quality; it's excellent. The songs are pretty good and it has Yuri Lowentahl Michelle Ruff and Johnny Yong Bosch. Like the Gundam series (also made by Sunrise wouldn't you know) the broad appeal here is a sort of median voter theory; there's action politics and mysticism so while there's not a huge amount of any of those things there's enough of this and that to satisfy everyone and not leave anybody out. I'm no fan of mysticism whether in anime or in real life but I'm not going to pass up politics and action in the one show. Yeah the show does start off being a lot like Death Note but after a few episodes it stands on its own and yes the ending was inconclusive when it came out but with R2 it obviously isn't anymore. Something else I like about Code Geass is I can relate to it; the rich invaders on one side of the street and the poor natives on the other; change street to river and you've got 8 centuries of the history of Ireland in one sentence; even nowadays in Cork and Dublin the rich live south of the river and the poor north of it but rather than drugs Irish people turned to alcohol. Not only that but Code Geass is alternate history so the British are still Celts (a bright haired pale skinned people the Irish the Scots the Welsh the Manx the Breton and the Cornish to one degree or another) and having moved to America they invade Japan. Indeed there was a real Celtic King called Clovis and he was weak as well. I've seen a lot of people on the internet flat out admit to having been on drugs while watching this or that video of anything really and with all of the hate on Code Geass I can't say I'm surprised that the internet is full of potheads.,3920,383,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't know why I was constantly avoiding watching this anime but it's the best ever!! I loved it so much! And I can't believe I finished both seasons within two days! But now I'm really sad that I did I seriously like fell in love with Lelouch. He was amazing! To be able to keep up a mask like that (not his literal mask of Zero but that fake personality) was outstanding! It reminded me a lot of the main character Light from Death Note. Both characters kept up their appearance -> fake personality top of the class (Light has top grades Lelouch is in student council); both lose their memories; and then sadly both die at the end of the story (but the story would have to end since they were both the main characters of their anime). Anyways I totally recommend these two animes to all! (Especially Code Geass). And to those who really like anti-heros! Enjoy!,3921,384,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Its hard to find the right words to describe how utterly perfect this anime is. The slow introduction of plot elements throughout the series the magnificent world building and the subtle little twists and turns suddenly becoming a rollercoaster. By the end of watching this series you'll be struck by how it ended exactly how it should have when the motivations suddenly become clear and the realization of what the show just pulled off you'll most likely be left speechless I know I was.,3937,394,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Here's a question for you What's the best anime ever? The answer to that question really does depend on your personal preferences. However how would you answer without using your personal preferences? There are several things that are needed to make a basis for an anime and they would need to be considered. There would have to be an intresting gripping thrilling story but that would need intresting characters to work. There would have to be good scenes but they would need good animation to improve on it and there would have to be a good soundtrack to fit said scenes. Now judging on that I am going to state what anime can answer that question Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. ,3941,397,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It's about  a prince who was disowned(basically his dad was a player) and sent to japan. While japan is at war with his father and now wants revenage on his father for being such a first class jerk and for what happened to his sister. ,3948,403,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A lot of people  i know don't like this anime as they find it cliche and typical of 'big robot anime' but honestly i find it to be an almost perfect combination. The main point of the story is the characters and the emotions they're handling rather than the robots making it a pretty deep anime...think gundam seed but with less emo and more strength of character.,3950,404,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: The story follows Lelouch Lamperouge a teenage schoolboy that lives in Japan which is now known as Area 11 after the Holy Britannian Empire the dominant empire that rules almost 1/3 of the world took it over after a short destructive war. It was because of this war that a young Lelouch declared that he would destroy Britannia to his friend Suzaku Kururugi. The story picks up after Lelouch discovered a girl in a ball that Suzaku now part of the military and the Britannian Military except a secret force under Prince Clovis la Britannia the third prince of Britannia and viceroy of Area 11 think is full of toxic gas. It is this girl that gives him the power of the kings the power Geass that allows Lelouch to escape certain death at the hands of this secret force.  With this power Lelouch can follow down the path to his ultimate goal to over throw Britannia. Though even with his power Lelouch finds himself having to gain the support of a rebellion group in Area 11 as Zero the man that will change the world. With trying to keep his normal life as a student and his sister Nunnally who he wants more than ever to live in a world that will not look down upon her away from his movements as Zero it leads to a whole lot of sometimes funny sometimes tragic most of the time entertaining adventures.,3960,411,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One of the best written shows I've come across. The scale of this show is just unbelievable and the way it was pulled off is mindboggling. The cast is huge but almost all characters manage to retain a distinct personality and even develop during the story. This is ofcourse helped by the pacing that is s fast as possible without making the viewers pay attention to it. I'm not personally a fan of the visual character designs but theres no denying the animation being top notch. Some episodes have a movies worth of material in them but I never found myself thinking that something was left out. The story is one of the most epic ones paling only in comparison to Gurren Lagann and it keeps itself afloat by being rational character driven and very unpredictable. The show rides on any heavy themes and is eerily enjoyable for anyone who likes shows that make the viewer guess or think.,3962,412,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Amazing anime if you like a futuristic  mecha type of show this is perfect for you. It requires some brainpower if you want to follow the storyline. It has the perfect blend of action adventure mecha and supernatural. ,3965,415,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Critic’s Log – August 10 2015. Review #96: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion.,3969,417,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was incredible one of the best animes I have ever seen in my life. I am a beginner at watching anime and I didnt think I would like mecha anime but this was epic. Firstly the characters are just so fantastic I love Lelouch despite his  arrogance  and plan with the world. Lelouch reminded me alot of Light Yagami from Deathnote. Then there was Suzaku who was also a wonderful character his friendship with Lelouch and will power is what makes him so great. OVerall this was perfect.,3970,418,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ah what can't be sad about Code Geass? Don't get me wrong I loved and enjoyed the tragedies and action that happened in this anime. But sometimes I felt like things went a little bit too far... It was a very racial anime and a lot of things that happened were wrong in my opinion. Not to mention how insane majority of the anime seem to be. The characters were also very hateable though too. But the good thing is that the action and sadness part of the anime was what did it for me. ,3972,419,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,3973,420,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When watching a show like Code Geass I'm reminded of a conversation I one time had with a friend of mine about the insufferably of the public and how easy it is manipulating them. he said and I quote:,3974,421,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,3977,424,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wanna hear a joke?  What do you get when you combine all of the currently existing anime fandoms with bipolar characters frenetic pacing and a Pizza Hut commercial?  That's right!  You get Code Geass the most evil show ever created by man.,3980,425,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Code Geass depicts the inner struggle any ordinary person can have when he discovers he can change the world. The main character Lelouch could be considered an anti-hero but that isn't wholy true or false. The story starts out right away and continues at a solid pace. There are some dull comical moments that could be shorter but the drama and mystery is correctly put in every episode. The bad thing about the story is that it doesn't provide as much backstory to the characters and the overall universe as it possibly could have but it is an intruing fun and exciting tale. The animation is fluid and the character designs are suberb. The sound is alright and the voice actors are a fine choice. Some openings don't have the best music though... but I digress. The characters aren't all interesting. The main characters are chosen over many mundane ones around the middle of the series but the main characters are well presented. Each one has their ideals and belief and the struggle between their ways of changing the world is interesting. You should watch Code Geass you won't be displeased. ,3981,426,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime was the best one I have ever watched. The plot is very good and I was really upset that it ended the characters are very well developed and I just can't get over it. It keeps you on your seat and makes you cry. It also has a family sense to it so I really recommend this anime to watch it's AMAZING!!!,3982,427,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A slow progression for such an overall great series. The protagonist's anger was a little irksome and hard to relate too. But the plot slowly unrevealed into something addicting. This anime series is definitely distinctive in character. I recommend it to any one wanting action and serious drama/ development of plot.,3983,428,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I think that is not easy to make a review of Code Geass but i'll do my best to day something the most objective possible about one of my favorite anime of all time...,3989,429,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: 7/10,3990,430,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Code Geass is my all time favorite anime. The characters are all clearly seen to be well thought out and individually developed. Each character has a persistant personality and any changes have reason. The story itself is also great. Characters have to undergo troubles that are extremely challenging yet always there is a plausable way to win. No characters are portrayed as overly powered so there is no epic killfest. Throughout the plot watchers may grow closer to the characters sharing their feelings. This anime is an all around great anime.,3991,431,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Great anime maybe not so unique characters. Main character has a very unique ability but everyone else behind him seem to be repeating itself. Guess no one can be that unique but i still give it 8. Story animation and sound gets 9 for good work.,3992,432,2019-04-13 21:35:39

this anime really had no main plot outside of the daily lives of four high school girl each with very different but basic anime stereotyped personalities.It doesnt take much to understand whats going on.It is comical and light hearted with a subtle hint of lesbianism which made me laugh.so if that mixture intrests you you will have no problem wacthing this series.,4010,440,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The STORY of A-Channel follows a young girl named Tooru entering High School for the first time and having to learn to share her best friend Run who is a year older than her and has made some friends in High School already.  The plot line is relatively weak but this is an anime that relys on the characters rather than the plot.,4015,445,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series was interesting with gene engineering as a concept and set 200+ years into the future. I like high tech anime sometimes and I was impressed with Geneshaft from the dialouge to the characters. The animation was great although at some points when characters had flashbacks the characters looked outdated. This was a more sophisticate version of a space story versus Kiddy Grade and Cowboy Bebop. ,4049,462,2019-04-13 21:35:39

OK Considering all things. This was a VERY Good anime! I was enveloped in the plot along with the characters. Sure at first I though 'Hmm great ecchi sure I'll watch' But the more I watched the more I fell in love with the series. The ending was Fanominal. I mean honestly I don't do reviews but here I am telling you people what I think about this anime. Don't take my word for it. Watch it yourself. Watchas the comedy plot turns to tragedy back to comedy then to a happy ending. Sure it's got it's sad moments but that's what makes it great. Being able to watch those moments and then beable to smile moments later.,4063,475,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a really great anime and usually during its release most of the people did not recognize the potential in yhis anime and thus it became the most underrated anime of its season(its my opinion tho).This anime has its mic of action packed adventure story accompinied along with great humor in it at certain times so it is not only focused fully on the action in the anime.Not only thatthe story of the anime is also peculiar as in not as the same as any mainstream animes which gets popular in no time because of its ''plot''..so guys if any of u have not tried this anime i urge you guys to watch itand trust me it is really fun and thrilling to watch it..u wont regret it..,4073,482,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime was fairly good but the only thing was that it was way to short they had a great concept the animation was incredible.  I hated the fact that there was no real love in this story it felt more like a love story but it actually wasn't.  If i could i would urge them to make a new season but that would all depend on the dvd sales and it wasn't that popular in japan.  oh well not much we can do i definitely recommend this anime although short really good.  ,4083,489,2019-04-13 21:35:39

*sigh* The first episode was interesting and the secondaught my attention. After that the show wasn’t bad but it also wasn’t makingery much progress in the plot other then Cecily trying to get Luke’s attentionnd get him to make her a katana. Really the only person I liked the most wasria. She’s a darlin and the best character in the series.  The ending was somewhat interesting but as ahole I was greatly disappointed in how this turned out.,4087,493,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When you watch enough anime you start seeing alot of recycled characters.  Erza from Fairy Tail but with Lucy's personality is the main female protagonist.  Her skills center around a similar principle to Erza as well magical swords.  She is at her best when she is using the magical demon sword from which she appears to have a unique ability to bring out its greatest power potential from among any who could use it.  Her look is almost a total copy of Erza save for the maid like head gear.  In another sense this anime mirrors Full Metal Alchemy given the way Luke uses his magical forging technique which he got from the demon lord.  It is unique in that it requires two people with complimentary magic skills to work on and create the total magical forge from which he can create short term powerful magical weapons.  ,4088,494,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sacred Blacksmith! I think it's safe to say this was one of my first  fantasy/medieval  themed anime. I'm really into those genres so it's kind of suprising that I haven't watched more. I'm not going to write a long essay review because that's not how I do things. I never followed the crowds anyways so who cares?? Here we go~,4096,498,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If there's anything I hate in an anime series whether it's adapted from a manga or light novel or whatever it's a villain that totally has the power to crush the protagonists but ends up failing because they're overconfident. While I certainly wasn't completely put off by the ending the notion that the sole reason for the main characters' success and victory was the villain deciding to stand there and mock them before getting schooled... I dunno that doesn't sit well with me and it's unfortunate that many movies and shows out there use a similar approach in creating an ending. Ah but enough of me ranting about the ending you all will see what I mean soon enough should you decide to watch.,4101,502,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The Sacred Blacksmith was entertaining overall. Along with the dark sword &orcery fare which as a D&D; fan I found appealing from the beginning there werelso comic moments and a dash of ecchi to lighten things up. I likedll the characters and enjoyed their interactions. The action scenesere well-done but some parts did seem a bit rushed.,4103,503,2019-04-13 21:35:39

this movie had the best animation i have ever seen in a film not even a movie like the wind rises had better animation than this. And to go along with the beatiful animation they gave us beatiful characters each having their own personalities overall this movie is one of my favorits the only thing i didnt like is the ending was not the best. But even so it was still a beatiful ending. so overall i would most certanly recomend this film for anyone that is looking for a heartworming story or a romantic one.,4112,507,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Makoto Shinkai has gathered a reputation in animation despite only having a few works to his name. His distinct direction and visual style have garnered him high praise and he is noted for being one of the few anime directors to really push the boundaries of realism in animation. Garden of Words is his fifth feature length directorial work despite its short length of only 45 minutes. It tells of a young boy named Takao and his growing friendship with an older woman he meets in the park during a downpour of rain. He is an aspiring shoemaker at an uncertain point in life and she is a teacher named Yukino at his school struggling with depression after an incident involving a rumour about another student. The story follows the two as they grow closer and begin to slowly open up about their insecurities and uncertainties in their lives.,4124,512,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I've been looking forward to Garden of Wal- I mean Words for quite some time now. By the now quite famous Makoto Shinkai and his studio CoMix Wave.

This barely qualifies as an anime. If you watch it you will understand. Its basically a short art movie that happens to be animated. So if you sit down expecting to watch something magical(figurative or concrete) you wont get it. This is basically a psychologycal short with some slice of life in it. Dont expect action you wont get any. Its about a kid who is too mature fo his age and he has a dream and has problems with the transition from childhood to adulthood. Its also about an adult who is emotionally immature and has problems with getting over some tough stages of her life. The meet(by chance) and help eachother. There is also a romantic thread here which is kind of strange maybe a bit wrong but it realistic.,4136,520,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Animen 200 Words: InuYasha Movie 1: Affections Touching Across Time,4183,542,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ghost in the shell was amazing simply amazing.  My only issue with it was the amount of nudity in it.  it seemed excessive for the type on film this was.  Ghost in the shell has an intense plot that is not for the simple minded. The plot was great catching the rogue computer virus taking over a cyborg body then that virus gaining animal instinct and trying to reproduce this shows what can happen to mankind when we over-computerize ourselves.  The other unique feature is the deeper meaning of just the title Ghost in the Shell and its relation to Motoko.  Throughout the movie they discuss their  Ghosts .  The Ghost represents the human soul or what makes humans human and the shell represents the characters cybernetic bodies.  Man is trapped in the cyber body trying to be as human as possible.,4186,543,2019-04-13 21:35:39
La historia de  Ghost in the shell  transcurre en el año 2029 en un mundo onda Lain (que buena explicación pensar que había empezado tan serio :-P). Los países desaparecieron (¡sii!) y el mundo se fusionó en una enorme red la cuál es monitoreada y protegida por policias que investigan los cyber-crímenes (? sé que sonó re-estupido pero no se me ocurrió una mejor palabra). Una de las divisiones de esta policía es justamente la sección 9 en donde trabajan nuestra protagonista la mayor Motoko Kusanagi y su compañero Bateau.,4187,544,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,4188,545,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I’m not quite sure what to make of Ghost in the Shell.  I think it’s a good film thought-provoking and entertaining with dynamic animation and an interesting cast of characters.  But it’s also curiously pedantic – the exposition is just a little too on-the-nose and the ending is an anticlimactic mess.  It’s still an excellent movie but at the end I found myself wondering “Is that it?”,4189,546,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story was good but it was really short. The last and final episode for this shw's season was Episode #39. The show could have been made a little longer. The show didn't have much to offer and it wasn't that much entertatining. I would recommend this show to people who like anime but not all of you might like it. Word has it that their might be a new season 4 so the show might make up for whatever creativity and entertainment they lacked in this season 3. The show could have been a lot better but it was still okay because it did have a lot of action.,4198,553,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This had a pretty good story line. It definitely wasn’t iny tastes and it took me a good 6 months to finish it but I did finish it! Iteally was too magical girly for me though haha. All in all I liked Fateestarossa the most she grew quite a bit from the beginning of the show andanoha well she pretty much stayed the same thoughout until she made up herind on what she wanted to do. Like I said before the show isn’t in my tasteange but it was pretty good nonetheless.,4201,556,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is probably one of the most underrated series out there; it's a real hidden gem. Most might bypass it because it looks like a magical girl series. But no matter who you are take time to watch all three seasons of this; you won't be disappointed. It's been said that Nanoha(the character) is one part Sakura (from Card Captor Sakura) one part Goku (from Dragon Ball) and one part Gundam. Seriously the producer is a big Super Robot Wars fan and the color scheme of Nanoha's magical girl outfit is a direct shout-out to a gundam. Her Goku reference comes because she tosses out magical energy blasts as if they were going out of style.,4208,559,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'd seen the magical girl genre parodied in other series but Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha was the first time I actually satown and watched a  real  one.,4209,560,2019-04-13 21:35:39

After the demise of Nobunaga a new foe arrives on the scene and he's big he's bad and he;s an ape... oh wait I mean Toyotomi. He makes his presence known from the very first episode. Staying true to most of the story set back in history Sengoku Basara Ni still doesn't disappoint. This time around though it's a bit more serious as the story revolves around old bonds between friends that have died and of course some strange alliances. We'll get to that later thought here it is your moment of Zen...,4213,563,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is bascially about a rich boy and his human-like robot that he found one day and decided to take care of it. This is a yaoi anime and is based off of its manga  Hybrid Child  by Nakamura Shungiku. This is a very short anime but it's not that bad. ,4280,580,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When you first read about this show I'm pretty sure you'll think it's pretty sad like me but this show is actually very cute! Its about two sisters who live by themselves since their mom died giving birth to the youngest and the father got obsorbed in debt and abandoned them. It features them getting through the daily struggles that they face and them having a positive outlook about their lives together. This show had me in tearing up with a smile because they both wanted to protect each other and while making a bond and inspiring those around them ( that may sound really cheesy and what not but its the truth) so if you like that sweet family bond building kind of anime this is definately a good choice.,4282,581,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story - Not really a deep plot or story. It was meant to be a parady series. Some times when they lost a battle it did annoy me. I was rooting for them and cheering Class-F on but they couldn't seem to win. And it sucked since it was just the Class-A kept getting lucky. About halfway it did stray away and have episodes based on specific characters. I liked this because it gets you to like the characters a lot better and understand their relationships with each other.,4320,591,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I absolutely loved this show. It was hilarious and I really enjoyed every episode. I loved all the different colors and how everything was so brightly colored. The jokes they made were funny and I always looked forward to the next episode. ,4331,592,2019-04-13 21:35:39

From pretty much you can see what Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu is going to be all about.  Which is aside from the first couple of episodes and the last couple of episodes nothing more than senseless humor with some sense of a plot added in evey now and then.  Though surprisingly enough this works out extremely well.  I soon found myself not caring so much about the plot and how the story was going and instead found myself waiting of the next punchline and wondering when the next nosebleed was going to occur.  The animation is pretty standard and doesn't do anything really all that new and it for the most part still works out pretty well in capturing the feel of the series.  The opening and ending are pretty much the only thing you'll remember in terms of soundtrack and the voice actors all do a good job in protraying their characters.  In terms of characters there is pretty much the standard class.  You have the princess of the group the prevert the idiot the flat-chested girl the trap and etc.  All characters are fairly well thought out and seem like they actually belong in the series and add something in some way or another to the series.  Overall I found myself enjoying the series and going back every now and then to watch certain episodes.,4339,595,2019-04-13 21:35:39
An okay anime not one that focuses on many normal settings and the plotline being called weak is an overstatement however I rate it so highly only because it is based on something I have never seen anything else even closely related to (Other than maybe Yu-gi-oh GX). It's an okay anime all around and is on the verge of being in my top 25.,4340,596,2019-04-13 21:35:39

You might wonder how this anime might wind up with 6/10 over all when it's mostly a 4? To put simply this anime made me laugh. The whole show can be summed up as crazy insane stupid fun with a side salad of ecchi fan service. Don't go into this expecting a serious story or expecting any of it to make a lot of sense and you'll have a fun time watching this short series. Worth a watch if your in the mood.,4355,600,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Baka pretty much sums up this anime. The idea for the anime isn't really original but that's not really an issue. This anime is stupid! Now I'm not saying it's bad just stupid. The main characters are stupid the story is stupid and the idea is kinda stupid too. Basically the school is set up so that after the first year each student takes a placements test and are placed into classes based on their score on the test. Class A is for the highest scoring students. They have the nicest classroom (although it's hardly a classroom more like a five star resort) the best equipment and the teachers and principals like them better. Then there is class B which is almost as good and still thought of pretty highly. After that is class C D E and F. F is the class full of absolute idiots and a few people who just didn't do well on the placement test for other reasons. The F class has old low tables that break easily old cushions that have lost their cushion and look worse than something a homeless person would have and dust every where. At one point class F ends up with cardboard boxes for seats and even wood boards on their lap an another point. The lower classes like class F and E and maybe D are located in the old building which is rather run down while the other classes are in the new building. Even the cafeteria lunches are different. The reason for all this: to make students want to study hard to make A students stay A students by seeing how crappy F class is and to encourage the lower classes to work harder. That isn't the whole of it though. Classes can declare war on another class in order to switch equipment with them (though I don't think anyone ever switched equipment in the series). Wars are fought in this weird technological field thingy that I can't really explain. Each student has an avatar which I also can't really explain and the avatars are who fight the battles. The goal is to kill the avatar of the other teams class reprasenative. However beating a higher ranking class is difficult. The avatars strength is based on the students last test scores in each subject and the one on one challenges are in specific subjects chosen by one of the students. Since the  smarter  classes generally have higher scores on their test it's hard to beat them unless you know their weakest subject and you happen to be really good at that subject. If the avatar dies the student is taken to a remedial class which we never see and don't really know anything about. To make an avatar stronger or replace lost strength during the battle the students can take a test with unlimited questions but it only does any good if they can get a high enough score to go back and fight before the battle is over. ,4363,607,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you were to take anime as art reflecting the real world you would figure Japanese high schools to be places full of huge breasted girls oblivious guys who don’t realize that six girls want to pork him and you’d probably get the idea that Japanese high school kids get nosebleeds upon seeing the cleavage of a woman. These are not actually true as Japanese high schools are not much better than any other high schools and the only reason anime treats high school as a place of fun violence tits and more tits is because it makes high school a much more exciting place than it actually is.,4364,608,2019-04-13 21:35:39
There isn't really much of a deep and coherent plot.  However it's great.  The jokes they tell and the running gags are absolutely hilarious!  During the end it got really serious and that's when I got pretty hype.  Each character had their own thing that made them a vital part to their show.  They each had their own dynamic along with great depth to go with it.  Overall I wished that it just didn't drop a whole drama bomb at the end of the series because I hate being left with questions.,4365,609,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Baka to Test to Shokanjuu is exactly what it sounds like: BAKA! It tells the tale of the class for the under-achievers Class F in a prestigious academy in Japan. The characters try to prove themselves by starting Shokanjuu Wars an event in which they fight with their own avatars and try to defeat their opponents by using their academic knowledge. The show is a frenzy of laughs and sighs as you watch these  Bakas  be as baka as they get.,4371,611,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Baka To Test To Shokanjuu a seemingly peaceful school comedy that seems like nothing out of the ordinary...for the first 3 minutes. After the insanely addictive opening the show goes to a scene inside the insananity they call a school explaining that the school is a summon school in which the students get top-notch technology that can summon an avatar of themselves (with teacher's permission of course). Then it shows the conditions of the classes the students get Class A gets to be luxarious Class B gets to be semi-lux Class C and D look like normal classes Class E looks like a poor classroom and at last we have Class F the lowest of the low who got tested and failed nad got put in the deathtrap that is Class F. With broken tables worn out cushions and a broken teacher's podium the only thing holding them together is super-glue! The main character Akihisa Yoshii comes up with a plan to help a girl Himeji get a better school environment they then start a Summons War and goes aginst Class E they eventually win which means they get to swap classes with Class E but the class Leader Yuuji Sakamoto has other plans! What are his suspicious plans!? Watch this exciting and fast-paced comedy to find out!,4375,612,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: Baka and Test lacks in the plot department. However it doesn't lend itself to having a deep and profound plot. It's full of running gags and comedy and it does well in both aspects. It's incredibly funny and the gags don't really get old. They're humorous from the beginning to the end. I laughed a lot and I would watch it again. It's light and funny and doesn't give you too much to think about other than how enjoying it is to watch. Some elements are recycled and although it had little plot I thoroughly enjoyed it and had fun watching it. ,4385,617,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Oh boy. This one. This series really had potential. It's concept is about humans who've become dependant on a program called fractale (seems legit). The beginning was beautifully done with Clain (the protagonist who reminds me a lot of Renton from Eureka 7) beginning to have second thoughts after he meets Phryne a girl being chased by a terrorist group called the Lost Milennium. The first 4 episodes were full of epic scenes and really told a lot about Clain and his motives. But once Clain joins the Lost Milennium things take a turn for the worst. Episode 5 is pretty much Clain getting accustomed to Fractale and we learn a bit about Nessa (Phryne's doppel) and Phryne's relationship. But most of the episode was find Nessa. The rest just got worse. The finale was 5 episodes. And all that happened was the group Phryne was a part of kept capturing her/she tried to deal with them. All it accomplished was that Phryne was a bossy irrational jerk who for no reason whatsoever left Clain in the dark about Fractale. ,4398,630,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Fractale is the first good Science Fiction anime I have seen in quite a while.  I expect the story to eventually tank or disappoint me in some major way because that is the general destiny of high-minded SF anime but so far it's maintaining a good balance of tone that is really impressive.,4400,632,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I've been rapid-fire reviewing anime for over a year now at 4kyeah.com with my friends and compared to the dozens of anime we've spotlighted or even the hundreds of anime I've seen by myself Fractale may be the most I have ever been intrigued by an anime.

It was a good story nice and short and to the point. For some reason it kept reminding me of the great anime Blassreiter. The story revolves around corrupt governments and officials and tyrrany and such however the evolution of the plot was quite interesting. It had a few in-your-face ironies and such but one thing I never expected was the development of such gore and bloodshed. One of the characters that died actually hurt me I would've preferred her to stay alive but it did make for a better story. I recomend this to mecha and military fans. Its a great way to pass the time. I'll probably keep it in my collection for further viewing alongside Full Metal Alchemist and Ghost Hunt,4443,646,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Action is the spice of life. This fact seems toave passed Ride Back by; instead it reworks the mecha genre – get this – with less epic awesomeness and a lot more teenage moping!!!1! This is indeed deceptive stuff that begins riproaringly well in the first episode with outstanding stunts that only the likes of MADHOUSE could deliver. Only to deteriorate rapidly into a plodding account of the main character Rin being very very sad. Why is she sad? Because she misses her robot which has gone off somewhere.,4452,651,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Teekyuu is a fast-paced comedic anime parodying other anime series by using anime cliches. While there isn't a real story other than four girls are in a club each story has a decent story that is similar to a specific genre of anime with some episodes parodying ecchi and the finale parodying horror anime. The characters themselves are super generic. You hae the stupid one the serious one the pervert and the other one.

Story: The plot primarily focuses around Tsukasa who is trapped in a game known as The World for about six months with no recollection of the past initially. We start out in a dungeon where Tsukasa wakes up and we're immediately introduced to Mimiru but then abruptly leaves by the anti-social attitude trying to remember what happened before the start. Our protagonist then encounters Silver Knight of the Crimson Knights who inquires about the relationship with a strange character Macha. After finding out been unable to log out we stumble upon Bear and BT which are other important characters. Subaru who's the leader of the Crimson Knights shows up a couple of times who is another important recurring character. Tsukasa then meets up with Macha and is then given his guardian which protects against Silver Knight's ambush. At the end of the first debut what we get is a glimpse of Tsukasa's real body in a coma. The first half of the show is trying to figure out why Tsukasa can't log out or who exactly what Aura is. Our main characters are interested why that is along with the other anomalies that happen in the game while trying to build a relationship with Tsukasa. Crim is introduced later on to embark that mystery too. They first investigate about what they think is a legendary in game item known as the Key of the Twilight which leads them into a strange dungeon where they meet up with a bizarre character uttering words about a sleeping girl that only Tsukasa knows about at first. The later half of the show is about figuring out the intentions of a powerful entity who transcends the game's system like Tsukasa does. This is where Subaru and Sora who is also introduced earlier in the story gets more involved when Subaru expresses her intention to meet up with Tsukasa which conflicts with Silver Knight's view so that leads her to disbanding the Crimson Knights. Later on Sora hooks up Bear with a hacker known as Helba and is important for revealing a lot of the revelations near the end. As Subaru gets closer to Tsukasa it is then decided that they go to where Aura once was. Tsukasa then breaks down when Morganna takes the Aura away. Bear and the group goes on meeting that bizarre man that apparently looks like Herald Hoerwick once again to better understand Morganna's intentions. A chain of Helba's statement reveals everything about Tsukasa and Aura. It's revealed that Tsukasa was trapped by Morganna to be used as a tool to stop Aura from awakening. Sora then decides to side with Morganna but when Mimiru Subuaru and Tsukasa comes to thwart her plans he turns against Morganna which results Sora going into a coma. The whole entire gang is then confronted by Skeith who was created by Morganna only to suddenly have every one of them to forced to log out when Helba deletes the Net Slum for an anticlimactic ending which shows Tsukasa and Subaru meeting in the real world. Despite the enthralling character driven story it has some of the worst pacing issues with the character's extended dialogues. It starts out very slow and doesn't reveal the background behind The World until the near end. Another big issue is that .hack//SIGN fails to contain itself in the end so you have to rely on the tetrology of the original games to explain plot holes like how Tsukasa got trapped or the The World's entire background. Subplots like Sora's fate or what happens when it comes to Morganna are disappointingly terminated unless you explore the said games. The story does a good job on focusing Tsukasa but fails to go further about the game's background and the immediate future. ,4468,660,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First impressions of this series after several episodes leave me wondering when does it come alive?  The lead character Tsukasa has more in common with a zombie or a empty shell lifeless robot than a human character with any sort of story appeal character or emotions.  He is about the most boring lifeless dead weight character I have ever seen in any media so far.  I keep waiting for something to wake him up and make me the viewer take any sort of interest in him but so far I am constantly disappointed.  It should not take this many episodes for a character to feel or project some sort of life and interest.  The story itself is pretty bland lifeless and boring.  No character seems to do much more than stand or sit around and chat about their problems with each other the game or the lifeless interloper Tsukasa.  Treatises on this show talk about it having a mystery appeal but if there is never a life line to pull you into the story how can there be a mystery let alone a interest in it?  They drag on the whole what is going on with Tsukasa episode after episode with no character taking a serious effort to resolve it beyond whining and idle banter and usually with each other and not Tsukasa.  Tsukasa himself seems to have no interest in life the game or anyone anywhere so where is his appeal?  I get the whole  I wanna be alone thing  but this is dragging on too long and too slow to appeal to anyone who wants to stay awake.  However it presents a problem if he never takes an interest nor effort in anything then how can he ever hope to help himself or solve his problems?  I am not seeing anything yet to draw a viewer in nor to identify with him or understand him.  When he is alone even he never says or does much of anything so there is really little more but seeing his body walking around to even suggest he is really alive or a character at all.,4470,662,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Slow and depressing but don’t let that deter you the plot is really thick if you actually pay attention and toward the end a lot happens they say patience is a vertue and trust me itl pay off with this. Tsubasa is trapped in the game world in which he doesn't even wanna be in anyway a team of curious and concerned players attempt to uncover the mystery both on who Tsubasa really is and how to save his life.

The feeling that really describes .hack//SIGN for me is wasted potential. The premise and world are marvelous; the animation smooth and detailed and the graphic design excellent. The plot is decent and the music is superb. But the characters! The voice acting the script the personalities it was all so wrong that it just brought everything crashing down. This show could have been so much and yet it became so little like a great play performed by ametuers. Indeed the only way the characters could seem passable is if you looked for some hidden message in the more conveluted and abstract levels of the plot. I'm not sure if playing the games  is necessary to understand the show or what but for me this was a failure matched only by the perfection it could have been.,4480,670,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This was the first anime I ever watched so I hope I am not being Nostalgia-blinded. The story is great the animation is okay but my favourite aspect of .hack//SIGN is its excellent characters and amazing soundtrack. I still listen to the soundtrack even after all these years. Key of The Twilight is one of my favourite songs from any anime. The characters....where do I even begin. All of them felt so bland to me during the first few episodes where I thought of dropping this entirely (I was nine but I knew blandness when I was exposed to it) but I kept on going. After I finished watching all 26 episode and Intermezzo I got attached to all the characters to the point I wanted to stay with them rather than real people (note I didnt have much friends back then). I hope all their lives turned out well in the real world after all that happened.,4486,675,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A very pleasant surprize. With the best anime you usually have a story that is somewhat unique. This implies some amount of supernatural. Arslan Senki doesnt have a special story in this way. Its pretty simple. Anime like this usually fade into boredom or go apeshit mad and ruin everything like Berserk. ,4513,694,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was entertaining to watch. I have not watched the earlier OVA of this and don't plan to. I reccomend to those who enjoy a classic medeival story. At first I thought it the mood in this anime would be darker than normal conisdering the first view episodes but the tone shifted the more positive and optimistic for the rest of the series.,4514,695,2019-04-13 21:35:39
(>◡◠)✌ This anime has a fine idea for the story and it has interesting characters unlike you've seen before but it fails to bring the viewers into the story itself. ( ◡́.◡̀) This tale might be fine for those who love fighting war conflict but to the other audience - this anime fails to grasp their interest. ( ˘︹˘ ) There is some big misunderstanding and peculiar reactions between the characters; nevertheless it is a fine anime to get into especially if you like history or a tale with revenge and emotions.,4515,696,2019-04-13 21:35:39
               I honestly hated this anime up till episode 8 I forced myself to keep going. When episode 9 came along I started to slowly like the characters a bit more. Suddenly I started to like the story and all the other aspects. This anime quickly became one of my favorite anime of all time. The story always throws you around with its plot twists and secret messages. The littlest things can be extremely important later on in the story and it is downright spectacular. The character development is extremely good I went from hating a character to loving him. The animation is amazing I love the environment and the character animation grew on me throughout the anime. The setting is messed up with sibyl and crazed killers running amongst the streets. This anime got my heart pounding and had me crying at certain points. This is a great anime and whoever is having doubts of watching it will be surprised when they start loving it.,4521,697,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Psycho-Pass has become is gateway anime for those who enjoy crime shows or cyberpunk. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what will come next or how the world of Psycho-Pass works. The animation is best expirenced in HD as it is a triumph in modern anime. The soundtrack comes with great openings and endings songs along with a great score. I grew very attached to the characters and their designs. The technology of the world is every cyberpunks dream. LED screens everywhere and high tech weapons control Japan. ,4535,704,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I basicly made a review of the show while discussing it with another member so Ill share my view with the rest of the community aswell.,4541,708,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i was kind of hesitant to start this anime because it seemed a bit wierd but after watching a couple episodes i was hooked i had to know what happened and i got attached to the characters i will not spoil anything for those who havnt watched it yet. one thing i can say is this is one of the better animes' but of course it needs more episodes ^_^,4544,709,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I loved this series!!!,4547,710,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Psycho Pass takes its watchers into a deeply interesting setting complemented by numerous strong characters but they are ultimately let down by the plot that connects them. Spoilers for the entire story ahead.,4548,711,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In a futuristic world governed by a “perfect” system everyone’s lives are decided by their psyche. The system has the ability to scan everyone’s brains to see if they are mentally stable or not. In this world where everyone is safe because all those with the “capability” to inflict harm on others are taken care of no one could think of anything-harmful happening to them.,4549,712,2019-04-13 21:35:39
While the series starts off great and with an interesting promise the second half kills it by making it way too slow-paced. Nothing exciting happens in the second half. It's a shame really.,4550,713,2019-04-13 21:35:39

How clouded is your psycho pass? Let's start the review off well this anime has amazing things about it the animation style is fabulous the music is epic and creepy the fights are awesome it gets the basics perfectly. This anime is a must watch it has my favourite opening song to a anime and it pulled me in to watch everything so easily. I love the way that Kougami is just like Sherlock Holmes putting te whole mystery together to fast with little to go by. Now I know the review is a little lacking because everything in my head is a spoiler but I will say this deaths is this are a little messy if you don't like lots of blood give it a miss. I have only watched the first season and a season 2 review will come out after its finished. So final verdict for Psycho-Pass is a 9/10 its great beautiful amazing but it says at a 9 because the plot is mainly a revenge path.,4554,716,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I first heard of this anime after coming across a review of it but I totally forgot what it said about it.  However I remembered the whole basis of the show.  Later on I saw this on Netflix and decided to watch it there and immidietly got hooked.,4557,719,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Psycho-Pass is can be summed up as overrated. It has a cool concept no doubt about it. The world it creates is interesting and evocative. The animation and sound are solid all around and definitely top tier stuff. And yet Psycho-Pass tries to play on the psychological and character aspects while having one of the most singularly dull leads of all times. There is also a gaping plothole at the center of the premise. There are plenty of fans to sing the praises of the series but all in all it is an above average time-spender and nothing more.,4562,723,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story 7.5 : Well to say this plainly  this was a little disapointing . There was only two fight's with Ippo . And he didn't he fight for the world title . And just after two fights he gets hurt . The other fights were ok . But i completely hated to gag fight. And personally the last like 4 or 5 episodes were just filler to finish the anime . If they just spent two episodes then that would have been fine .,4599,739,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really cant give a good review on this show for i dont know what i just watched. Reading the intro to it i thoughy it could be good but after watching a few episodes i am left with more question then answers. Literally more questions then answers. Nothing was answered. One episode just had flesh being ripped apart and one word spoken onii chan.I t is filled with gore every episode is unpleasant so i wouldnt recomend it to people with weak stomachs. Be reminded that this isnt just blood being shown this is really disgusting gore that makes you close your eyes at some points ecen if you have a strong stomach. When i watched it there seemed to be a sister-brother fetish going on but i don't go into details on that. In the end if you still want to watch it I'm not going to stop you. There's value in every animation and some people might like this stuff.,4621,752,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Pupa Review:,4639,754,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime has a lot of speculation. And it's meaningful.,4640,755,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow... people really weren't joking when they called this a horrible anime. It's pretty lame not to mention pointless. It's a good thing that the entire series only lasts about 40 minutes--I managed to finish it in 15 when I sped up the video 1.5 times faster and skipped some gratuitous gore.,4644,756,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My reason for giving this anime a 0.5/10 are the following reasons:,4645,757,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When reading the description of Pupa you might become interested at the unique situation it presents but it's a trap. Its hook  a sister turned monster  might be enough to reel the average person in but the short 4 minute episodes of nearly pointless and unfortunate gore reveal there is no lasting value.,4646,758,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was hopeful for this anime for the fact that its horror and a lot of people seemed to like it.,4650,759,2019-04-13 21:35:39
While I was watching it ... I get sick ... not because it's ugly/bad but it's show you in a good way how cannibalism looks like XD (neither tokyo ghoul made it to this level ... I saw up to S2 ep 7 TG) anyway my vote it's low only cause it was too much ... crude/piping (almost for me) and yeah to be a 4 min per episode you can see them kinda fast and ... the story it's not a pearl,4651,760,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It's hard to make a good anime if it's only 3 mintues long for 12 episodes. It really leaves you too little time to establish a story and it's characters. I have not read the manga but I heard there were some changes and some characters didn't show up in the anime. I guess they didn't have time to add them. The consesus is that this is a pile of crap as an anime. Yes it's not good but I don't think it's as bad as so many people say it is. I watched this twice. The first time an episode at a time each week when it was first released. Than I watched it again as a marathon. Enjoyed it much more when I watched it all at once. It's still bad but you can piece things together much better. I'm not sure what they were trying to do by making this so short. It could have been much better even as a 15 minute per episode series.,4653,761,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Review point: anime adaption was choppy disturbing random and poorly done (it had so much potential!!) I would recommend reading the manga BEFORE watching the anime (if at all).,4654,762,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So I reviewed this show on April 1st 2015. I thought that this anime was a little joke where it was so terrible that a lot of people kept watching this so I thought I could watch this because it'd be funny and it'd probably have really cheesy moments and stuff so yeah...,4657,763,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A REVIEW OF PUPA,4660,764,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pupa is a masterpiece in it's own right being both a psychological anime and fitting so much frightening themes into a small time period. It says wonders about an anime that's only five minutes long to be so fantastic. It's truly a psychological journey into the monsters inside all of us and how family can always mend breaks in your life. Not to mention act as sexy incest bait. Pupa truly is one of my favorite animes not because it's borderline porn and a great way to get off but because it's just so encompasses the themes it tries to shoot for so well and I totally got that while watching Yume eat out her brother.,4662,765,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,4663,766,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pupa is up there with Mars of Destruction for anime that are so bad they're hilarious. This will be a short review because there's not much to say and it's all too easy to describe just why this anime is so terrible.,4664,767,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I think this id the most weird anime i ever seen. The storyis preety interesting though i think the summary talks it all that's thr plot' but for 5 minutes for episode i think it's good. I must say i liked the opening and ending they were good and the background music was also good. THe animation was good for a horror anime i think this is more horror gore than psychological though.,4690,778,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"Sometimes an anime about a school club can be good and interesting. But when it's a pretty boring club and none of the characters are interesting and more annoying than anything it tends to fail.

When you take a very cliched genred and try to make something original out of it there are 3 possible outcomes. It can turn into a memorable masterpiece. It can turn into something so weird only the angsty kids would watch it while prouldy saying it's  alternative . Or and this is the outcome in this show case it can look like cliche anime that is trying a bit too hard.,4697,781,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I know I know the decryption to sora noanimani sounds like the it is just an average romantic comedy aminend does nothing different then any of the other hundreds of romanticomedy amine that do nothing to differentiate them selves from theene. And you would be absolutely right but for what it lacks inreativity sora no manimani does make up for in quality. The story isextbook  boy returns to town that he grew up in after years of beingway and meets a girl who he hung out with back then. Some how theyoth remember each other by name even thow they only knew each otheror about a year. any why the boy joins the schools astronomy clubhere you are introduced to the majority of the cast. Any why the storys pretty text book but that does not mean it is bad. What this animeas is a great theme of astrology. It is fun but very educational athe same time and the stars are very well animated and unique. Sadlyhow the rest of the animation for this series is not as breath taking.haracter designs are about what you would expect from an averageho-jo but the back grounds are very ugly in my opinion.. The anime'soundtrack however is very good in my opinion. The oppiniong and endinghemes are very good in my opinion and are still stuck in my head andhe voice acting was very well done to the characters are very funnyut like everything in this series they are nothing you have not seenefore My largest complaint about this series thow is the ending whichoes not have a lot of closure and frankly does not resolve a lot ofhe romances in the series. But that is okay because of the promise ofn ova which might tie up those loose ends But overall sora no manimanis a fun ride for any fan of romantic comedy and earns a 7 out of 10,4698,782,2019-04-13 21:35:39

After having finished the first season of this cringey ecchi harem I decided to continue the drunk weekend with the sequel. With a name like Samurai Bride I had certain high expectations of this sequel hopes that it would improve on the original. I'd heard that his one was somehow worse than the original so I'd find out for myself. I could only find a good version of this in Japanese which I didn't want to watch due to my hate of Rie Kugimiya's voice and the unfortunate reliance on having to read subtitles. Things got worse as I 'd lost my marbles earlier in the week and had started my drunk weekend a day too early thus booze was running out. The only hope was for this anime to be good enough to not require alcohol to get through it. If one thought Hyakka Ryouran couldn't get any worse they started a slutty maid cafe...,4703,786,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Not sure what to make of this but you almost have to watch this right after watching the series because it dumps you right into the middle of a fight with no explanation what so ever of how they got there.

"I'll say this. I've watched both seasons of Tokyo Majin. I bought the DVD on Amazon.com after I watched them all. Believe it or not my entire family including my Mother got into watching this one. I couldn't give it a perfect review because  I really felt that the season was not fully realized nor all the characters fully explained or explored.  The main villain Yagyu Munetaka was given far too little backstory in comparison to the main villain of the first season. this is because it seems like more of two mini seasons instead of one full on one. The martial fist chapters were far better then the ending chapters. ",4714,791,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The opening lines of Minami-ke is the most succinct synopsis that exists. So we’ll go with that.,4737,806,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Minami-ke is a 13 episode slice-of-life comedy anime. If you don’t like slice-of-life (lacking in overall plot or narrative) then this is just another to avoid. But for the rest of us and those who love comedy my initial impressions were: I love it. It’s been a long time since an anime made me laugh so hard. While the jokes can get towards the iffy side of things there’s nothing that off-putting or pervy about them. This anime reminded me of Lucky Star and has many similarities. Those who enjoy anime like Lucky Star would enjoy this too. And this anime has a sequel… or two… or three!,4742,807,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Great show and a little better then the 3rd season which was the first and only season I had seen prior to this. Harukaana and Chiaki were great as well as all the secondary characters through allhe episodes.

"I watched this series on Youtube before buying the DVD Set. I try to dohat to avoid purchasing a bad Anime set. I liked this story because itas not drawn out too long and the story unfolds in an unusual style.ou don't learn how they got their powers till the second episode andt honestly works for me that way. They plunge you right into thection and then take you along for the ride. The characters themselvesre what interested me the most because they all seem to unfoldhemselves as the story progresses. They're not always fearless anderfect and they don't always save the person that needs saving --buthey try. My only complaint is that there were other characters thateeded more fleshing out and the ending to the show leaves it open for auture return to tell another tale. I honestly wish they would do anVA or something to give us that conclusion but I'm not holding myreath for one. ",4789,821,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"OMG - at first this anime was fast paced and as interesting as Red Garden. I just hated the Aoi character. She was pointless to me. She could have been the whole group's demise.

Okay so I've glanced at some of the reviews and I'm really confused why this seems to get put down a lot while No Game No Life is highly applauded. In my eyes this is a lot better but that is besides the point. One thing I've seen is this getting compared to Elfen Lied. I can understand this since it is by the same writer and has many similarities but I think it is best to always look at a piece alone first before comparing it to something else even when it comes to books turned into movies. So I will compare this to Eflen Lied but it in no way was the deciding factor for my ratings.,4799,828,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The entire second season of code geass in a single movie. Do not watch this if you haven't finished the series yet. The movie has no new animation and is mostly just reused matirial. Exept for some narration. I have given it a 5/10 score at the story because based on the movie alone the story is nearly impossibel to follow. But the actual story is in my eyes epic. This movie is ideal for the people that liked code geass and want to relive the epicness without having to watch the entire anime again.,4810,836,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you're going into this Animation hoping for a really good story that makes a lot of sense you're going to be very disappointed. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though especially with Hyperdimension Neptunia. Also if you are going into the Animation without having played Mk2 or Victory there is a good possibility you may or may not be confused as the Animation does sum up / play out stuff from those games. Watch the OVA as well so any loose ends from the Animation get tied up.,4833,852,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk is the 12 episode sequel to a fantasy action anime set in an RPG-like medieval world of course retaining the comedy. Unlike season 1 there’s no misleading 1st episode and the plot is more fast-paced and to the point but the intro does remain unrelated to the anime itself. Season 1 left some large loose ends which are picked up here. I recommend having watched the first season and maybe having read my review of it before even reading this review since there will be spoilers for things that happened back then. Months have passed since the events of the first season and the world has changed. I’ll also declare my dislike for ecchi harem love-triangles and pointless pervy BS I try my best to not let it get to me but be aware of it when you read my reviews.,4834,853,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I suppose one can't expect much from a 3 minute animation especially when it's actually just 2 minutes long plus 1.5 minutes of credits. That being said I kinda want my 2 minutes back. The cgi artwork and animation were great but that's all that there is to this special it's really just a tech demo. Sound is decent quality but it's just the same few bars of music over and over. There is virtually no story nor characters. If you're not familiar with battle angel alita/gunnm you won't have any clue what's going on and even if you're thoroughly familiar with it like I am it'll still be little more than chaos.,4851,860,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story started good BUT the most importantly...IT HAS A HORRIBLE ENDING...I WON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT AS AN ENDING!!!!! The author seems to decide to make this anime a  12 ep  and when he reached episode 11 he realized there is no more time...so he skipped about 2-3 ep worth of INFOMATION PLOT and STORY. He didn't connect ep 11 to ep 12 there is just a huge gap in between. Overall this anime had a great potential but was ruined due to ,4853,862,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I liked the whole idea about magic school academy and stuff like thatit was a great story and if the author wantedthe story would had a great development.....BUT...,4855,864,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story is very much confusing because the distribution of information between the episode is not proper enough. Much of the information has been skipped between episodes but i must say that the story material is strong enough but need proper execution. Sound animation and character designs are above average or are regular as other japanese anime. I don't know if production house will go for some more seasons but i think watching this anime is only waste of time in it's current form. Because in the end you will be totally confused and will not be satisfied. Better watch at your own risk!!!! ,4856,865,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Although the series was severely predictable I loved the concept and story. To be fair I knew pretty much everything that was going to happen after I had seen episode 3 or 4 - the show doesn't offer anything new.,4866,866,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I personaly really liked this series some of it was sort of predictable and a let down untill you get to episode 12 this ending was very poor and in my opinion left me puzzled with what had just happened and left to much unanswered i know this would usually indicate a 2nd season but this left so many gaps and blanks its making me regret watching it the anime. makes you grow on the characters in many ways and its just a let down for the ending it had so i would not recomend this unless you just want a headache i really enjoyed it dont get me wrong but the ending sort of ruins the whole thing. Also on aa unrelated note if you do decide to watch this ill put in a warning for this bothered me the animators had bad habit of drawing the mc without a nose XD as odd as it sounds more than half the series the screen showed him with no nose. it bugged me immensly.,4867,867,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Oh look! A show on magic and wizards and instantly over-powered highschool brats! Gosh we never see those in the anime world anymore. Its like everyone these days is just trying to make awesome animes with a decent story and interesting characters. It sickens me. We truly needed another cliched magic-related anime with questionable character development a protagonist who thinks with his ass more than his brain and an innocent yet dense female protagonist who exists solely to serve as the madien in distress.,4868,868,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I liked the story as it was starting off but as it started to progress I felt that a lot of pieces were missing in the story. Although later on some parts of my questions were answered I felt that it just wasn't fulfilling. The love triangle that developes ends up being lost in the end. The ending left us with a cliffhanger of sorts but not the type that hype you up to anticipate a sequel.,4884,873,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story Summary:   Welcome to the NHK  is about a young man named Tatsuhiro or Satou for short who is a 22 year old hikikomori and a college drop out.  The anime depicts about half of a year Satou's life.  This includes his friends and his epic journeys in and outside of his house. Satou believes that the NHK or  Nihon Hikikomori Kyōkai is making him a hikikomori.  This story starts as a comedy but then ends as a drama.,4896,876,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Welcome to the NHK is....average. After reading some other reviews I thought it might actually be really good and granted it was a little better than any of the summaries make it sound but it wasn't anything special. The story never really goes anywhere. When the anime starts there are several problems the characters face. When the anime ends it doesn't feel like those problems were really resolved. The characters are interesting to say the least but I think the writers were trying a bit too hard with them in some places. The sound was okay except the main female character was quiet and I had to turn up the volume to hear her clearly. The balance is just a bit off. The animation itself doesn't have any problems that I can think of; it was juast average. Giving it a 7 although I considered giving it a 6.5.,4929,891,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I must admit I went into this one not really knowing what to expect - perhaps a relatively mindless comedy that provided an easy watch a smidgeon of slice of life or even a romance story.

Ahh romantic comedy slice of life.  A genre that is utterly riddled with excessive fan service pointless implausible harems dorky pseudo-charming male leads and one dimensional blow-up-doll-ecchi-slut female leads.  As the genre goes Welcome to the NHK (NHK henceforth) didn’t simply exceed my every expectation; it blew them clear off their hinges.  It redefined – and quite possibly even redeemed an anime genre that I have long written off and never would have fathomed any hope for.  This show is certainly a diamond in the rough so let’s dig in and just begin to cite the many reasons why.,4991,912,2019-04-13 21:35:39

You will want to hold tight everyone that is special to you.  (At least it had this effect on me.),5006,917,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The STORY of AIR Movie varies from the story of the actual anime and personally I prefer the anime.  That being said I didn't hate the movie - it just wasn't what I was expecting.  I think I was just expecting a re-telling of the anime and felt let down; so go in with an open mind and realize this is drastically different from the anime and you'll probably end up enjoying it more.  It's a bit more realistic which I initially liked as well.  And (spoiler) Yukito and Misuzu actually kiss finally.  I also rather liked the mythology aspect of it and how it tied into the real world through Misuzu.,5014,919,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Little Busters Refrain is the second season of Little Busters. To be honest after I finished the first season I wasn't at all enthusiastic about it - you can look up the review if you're interested. But in that review I did add that a good second season might be able to overcome the flaws of the first season. And I'm really happy to say that that is exactly what happened. Little Busters Refrain takes the whole story to a new level giving meaning purpose and significance to everything that in the first season seemed ineffectual and senseless.,5019,923,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Honestly it's one of the better show i've seen last year and i would've potentially place it on my top anime 2014 list because it's that good. i do enjoy the slice of life and comedy genre especially when they are  not  in cliche overused high school setting that are done in mediocre standard. I do think that barakamon is unique and manages to stay unique throughout the show and bring us some quality show in a very standard genre but in a very different setting.,5036,935,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series is overall a nice slice of life about a calligrapher handa seishu who smacked the director of all japan calligraphy assosiation and as a result he was forced to move to an island out of nowhere to improve his art when he have lived his whole life in city  .It is a story of how he improves his art while interacting with all the villagers  and understand fun of living with society ........,5037,936,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The opening is cute and cheerfulbut it's not fun(for me).I don't like it very muchbut at least it fits the mood of the anime.The characters are really goodtheir design is good and their personalities as well.The story is simplebut very nice and funi just love this anime.,5039,937,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'll write a proper review later but here’s some explanations for the received scores.,5040,938,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Though I'm into art (cartooning to be precise) calligraphy doesn't really interest me.  However this anime is more about the interactions between characters and a little bit of a self-journey than the ins and outs of calligraphy.,5041,939,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,5042,940,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Barakamon is one of the best animes to come out the Summer 2014 line up of animes. In this review I will explain my presonal opinions on the show. If you wish to add a comment please leave it in the comments box below. Please enjoy!,5043,941,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Just as relaxing and cheerful as it seemed to be which was my primarly point in watching this anime. Period.,5045,942,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,5051,944,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Barakamon is a sweet and very cute anime and not one person does not like most of the characters especially Naru. Plus Handa Seishuu reactions to things make me laugh every time the anime is very creative no one would have thought of making an anime about calligraphy or something like that.XD!,5052,945,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,5053,946,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Seishuu and Naru's bond we're too freaking cute!! ,5054,947,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Stories such as Barakamon act as a reminder of seizing the seemingly mundane every-day things of life in order to feel content with whatever you achieve. The characters' cheerful and energetic yet calm approach to life made me smile through all episodes.,5056,948,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,5060,949,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Barakamon is a great watch and strongly recommended for anyone who likes watching laid back slice of life. It's written good and the animation+sound really emphasises the fun in it. Few of the characters were a bit generic and annoying and the story itself is very shallow. However the show is clearly ment to be a comedy with underlying themes instead of a deep and thoughtful show sprinkled with comedy and in this it succeeds extremely well. Its a show that easily enjoyable and it even works as episodic because of being so comedy driven.,5065,950,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First impressions based on ep´s 1-4(contains small spoilers),5070,951,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is the best slice of life I've ever seen. Normally I don't like these types of anime very much because I find them too slow-paced and lacking in interesting content but this one suffered from none of those issues. Events moved at a fairly brisk pace and the humor was top notch. Although the themes in the story are fairly common and simplistic they are presented so well that I found myself tearing up anyways. As one might expect it's the characters that make this anime great. I fell in love with most of them almost instantly. They're the kind of people you wish lived in your own neighborhood and if more of them existed the world would be a much better place. If you're looking for a good comedy or something to make you feel warm and fuzzy and appreciate the little things in life this is the show for you.  ,5071,952,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So many good long nice reviews. Makes me wonder if I can even help. I will attempt to keep this short and sweet to avoid any potential spoilers.,5072,953,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I know I'm supposed to be supportive of mentally disabled children making art but seriously this is utter garbage that isn't even in the  so bad it's good  category. If you feel like watching this jab yourself with a fork a few times you'll gain more from the experience.,5074,954,2019-04-13 21:35:39

After watching the first season of Ai Yori Aoshi i quickly found myself wrapped up in the story and wanting to know what would happen next when I finished watching Enishi I was a little disapointed in the end that they didnt go as far as the Manga did but that is tipical for an Anime.  dont get me wrong the story itself was great and the emotions of the characters really gets to you.  I would Recomend this to any one who hasnt seen it yet,5081,958,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The drawing is nice. The story is also nice but not very original because it slips into sterotyped patterns (love triangle the abuse of slave/pet role etc.)  The ending terribly SUCKS but the climax is intersting when they realise their love for each other (the «runaway» part). I Also like the vulnerability of the protagonist when she has to put a pride aside in certain situation.,5098,968,2019-04-13 21:35:39

by far the greatest anime ive ever seen but that may just be me personally but however the reasons for this are the animation story and characters were all great if you are looking for a romance anime that they dont start off instantly in love or already dating then this is the one for you it goes through the development of becoming good friends with someone you met by circumstance then proceeds the development of the relationship by making them realise their feelings and then finally start dating a great way to show off an anime in my opinion.,5109,973,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well first off I watched this anime a while ago and untill the very end thought that it was a really good anime. However the ending it had really wasnt to my taste. Toradora! had one of the most disapointing endings ive ever seen. but over all it was a really cool anime.,5117,977,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I got way to emotionally invested into the plot and i relate to nearly all the characters in someway i loved it and is probably one of my favourite anime 10/10 gonna it watch again,5118,978,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hi This is my first review and its on one of my favorite romance anime toradora! I binge watched this anime a while back and been meaning to write a review hope this helps!,5141,985,2019-04-13 21:35:39
          This anime is about a boy and a girl simple enough right? Wrong! Ok I left out a few characters. Okwhat this anime is really about is a girl who has a bad temper and a calm hosewife type guy with scary eyes. Due to some unfortunet events they end up becoming best friends knowing each other better than anyone else what better thing to learn about each other than the person that they like! Ryuuji and Taiga are like opposites Ryuuji likes Taiga's best friend and Taiga likes Ryuuji's best friend. While they are together it turns out that they life right next to each other too! the way thing worked out for them walking to school together Ryuuji having to take care of the childish and messy Taiga and always being together starts to give off the wrong impession to the people around them including there best friends!,5143,986,2019-04-13 21:35:39
All I can say is I tried. I really really tried to love this romantic comedy that anime fans all over the world fawn over like ants at a picnic. They eat this up claiming it to be the next coming of anime god saying how great the story and characters are but to me I could never properly digest it. It's like throwing up something that did not taste necessary bad but you will never want to eat it again. That is basically my feelings towards this anime in a nutshell. Now before any of you get too upset let me explain my reasons.,5147,987,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Toradora is a 25 episode romantic comedy (slice-of-life style) anime based upon the light novels written by Takemiya Yuyuko. Many years ago I tried the first episode and put it aside to watch later. Now I finally get around to watching it it felt like a recipe for disaster. Due to tsundere and a high-school setting which have a record of lacklustre romantic plots. Reading the novels left me enraged last I felt like that were the Zero no Tsukaima novels and unfortunately it has some things in common with this anime. The hope for this anime was if it went a different direction from the original material. While I have been a bit harsh on anime based upon novels the unique position of this anime provides it an advantage.,5158,995,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,5159,996,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The only word to describe Toradora is seminal; as far as romantic comedies go or romances set in high school this series is by far one of the greatest. The characters are fleshed out. Their interactions and the plot overall is entirely believable. The romance and changing feelings the anguish the heartbreak is all completely real. The sub is stellar and the dub is almost as good. Toradora is simply perfection. It stands at the top of the pantheon and will continue to do so for many many years.,5160,997,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The beginning of the anime was fantastic. It was hilarious had great characters and a good working love triangle. As the series goes on it dips further and further down a into a uninspired drama with the characters falling apart and absolutely no direction. The original love comedy style is ditched for a pitiful harem storyline and leaves you feeling depressed not because it was bad but because it could have been so much more. Despite that I was glad to have watched this anime for the great laughs but its gonna take me a while to rinse out the bad aftertaste.,5165,1,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,5167,2,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is the one of the best romance anime ever. The animation is amazing. The story is good because the characters dont start dating right alway unlike some anime. Anyway this anime is great if your looking for something romancey to watch. ,5168,3,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Toradora!,5172,4,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When I first started watching I could NOT stand Taiga. She was so abusive both physically and verbally. It was extremely frustrating and I was THIS CLOSE to dropping it. I absolutely hated Taiga. I thought I was going to end up rating this one star. But I made it to the episode where Ami was introduced and it slowly started getting better from there. Taiga's abusive tendencies toward Ryuuji lessened and lessened. And then I found myself enjoying the story. I started to like the characters more. By the end I was crying throughout the last two or three episodes.,5173,5,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I started out weary of this being an overly cutsy shoujo but was pleasantly surprised! I loved Ryuu and Taiga and the supporting cast was diverse and hilarious. With shows like these you know not to come in expecting to be shocked at the final outcome of who hooks up with who but there was a bit of a twist with this one which I like.,5177,6,2019-04-13 21:35:39

really a pretty boring anime I struggled to get through it but it did have its moments!  There were 2 or 3 things that were touched upon that really resonated with me but that is me personally because of the truths of life I've discovered on my own so generally I don't think this is worth watching.  I would definately not devote another 8 or 9 hours to watch this again.  ,5208,24,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Automatically this starts out with some lovely early 90's gorelearly influenced by the 80's still. yay random tenticals! I can seehere this is going already! The best part though is that it seems toe a male cast so far so there's bound to be some smoochin ;) A fewinutes later i am rewarded with tube kissing? o.O That's right one ofhe male leads is in a science place and sees a test tube person andets the overwhelming need to kiss it. i can only assume the monsternside has some lovely telepathic powers.,5212,28,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I am writing this after binge watching the first 14 episodes. I am quite surprised that Shirogane no Ishi Argevollen hasn't received better reviews it currently stands at 2.68/5.00. My guess for this is that in the first few episodes it felt quite conflicted whether this was an adult or teenage storyline. It has the depth and subtleness of an adult story with elements of the futility of war politics greed revenge power struggles loss and is an overal intelligent series but it takes it time to build on it. Where it fails is some of the characters. Jamie and Tokimune are somewhat irritating and I'm guessing they will predictably fall for each other  and then there are the female engineer techs who are shallow despite their obvious skills in keeping the machines in good working order. There are however some good growth episodes especially for Samonji who for me is the star of the series. There are many characters and I would hope over the course of the series that we will learn more and it will further strengthen the story. It is especially needed for the enemy forces.,5232,39,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hi everyone here i am giving my personal review on this anime enjoy:,5240,45,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When I first started watching the anime I was completely turned off by the similarities it gave to other anime. These would include Blood+ and oddly enough I had a nostalgic recollection of Inuyasha. Furthermore when I read the description I discovered that the main chstarter's name was Saya which did not help the anime's case. However whole watching I did gain an appreciation for how fast it got going. The audience ( me at the time ) did not have to wait for the main protagonist through 12 episodes for them to actually discover and accept who they are and what they were meant to do.,5241,46,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you've watched Blood+ and loved it you'll be surprised to see that this story has almost nothing to do with that one except a few allusions. You could watch this one alone without ever having to have watched anything prior. For me I've watched the first Blood movie and Blood+ and then this. Compared to it it's complete garbage and almost nothing like Blood+ except the demon hunting and Saya being a vampire. It would make serious fans of Blood+ really pissed off. You might have heard that this ending is an extreme what the fuck. And it is. If you really wanna muscle your way through it to be mindblown at the end go ahead. If not you're not really missing something you HAVE to see. ,5244,47,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This was a really fun anime to  watch. It really seems to pull you in. It has a little bit of everything but recomender only for people that like darker shows.,5252,52,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Review to this? No sir  it doesn't deserve one. All I'm going to say is that this was a complete disgrace  I forced myself to watch the whole anime and I was dissapointed of every little bit of it  where is the cool action  the awesome plot  the suspans  and everything else that were present in Blood+  I enjoyed that anime and a second season of that would have been great  but no  they had to create this  I wouldn't be surprised if this was created to fill in for some anime that can't air and they had a blank post in the tv program.,5263,58,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I like to make my review short sweet and down to the point. If you want to know about the plot of this anime -- its really confusing and hard to understand. to be honest just diving into it is actually a fun way to go. :),5265,59,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Let me just say that this anime is full of blood and gore so the animation doesn't dissapoint and the characters are fun and have well thought through personalities.Some of you might be wondering why I rated the story a seven and the reason is the anime starts out  slow  not as in  dumb but as in story development but I think the ending made up for that.The sound was great and the main idea was solid and entertaining.Overall this was a good anime and I recomend this anime to blood plus fans obviously.The parts I loved most were the blocked out monster piles too intense to show the deformed shape of what used to be a monster!

I was expecting a new story but with the original Blood+ characters what I got was a high school girl that fights monsters every night by the order of her father. Each episode brought about a new mystery to saya's life and each ending left me screaming for more. It is an anime filled with mystery and violence.,5276,66,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ah Blood-c how many haters this this show get when it was finished airing in the summer of 2011. But why? Let's take a look. The second series based in the cult movie Blood: The last vampire after the succesful Blood + released in 2005. But instead of make a sequel or remake of Blood + Production I.G. hire the group CLAMP to design the characers make a reinmagination of the story of Blood: The last vampire forgetting everything we learn about Saya in Blood + and tell a different story with tons of blood. The Blood + fans didn't see any of the elements they hope to see again and react calling the show trash and crap and count with the help of people who can't stand gore or think that everuthing CLAMP did sucks. Okay that people were wrong. ,5279,69,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is more of an intro and and outro than an anime since its 3 minutes and 30 seconds. It's about a small zoo that needs more animals I'm assuming to put on a show however the animals are not actually animals but girls in animal costumes. I guess you could describe it as a slice of life since it is just a slice of the usual girl things and them trying to figure out how to get people to go to the park the characters are cute and by the forth episode you get to see them outside of their chibi form but only in the outro which is catchy and expectantly cute :3,5281,70,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hilarious 3min shorts. Watch the original series first these are much better if you know what they are about; I can only expect confusion if you haven't! The writing is just someone pooping on a page but its the best kind of poop one can poop on a page. Probably the best extras I've ever seen. MUST WATCH!,5288,73,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Kite Liberator is an OVA based off a movie made in 1998 called Kite. Kite Liberator is basically an anime about a teenage girl living a double life as an assassin and progresses into the story of her dad who is currently in space as an astronaut. It's short confusing and filled with plot holes but it was still an enjoyable show to me.,5296,79,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This was such a bitter sweet film. As much as I was not fond of the ending it was so raw and real. Life is honestly just like that sometimes. The reality was harsh but beautiful in its own way. The main character Mitchiko is so vulgur hard-coreyet still loveable. When she and the young girl Hanna meet and their destiny's merge they develop a life long friendship. This is anime is also very unique. I have yet to see another like it. It is filmed in a entriely Hispanic/African style setting which is rare and the music is so fun and lively. It is very action pased and the characters are nearlyl on run from police throughout the entire show. The goal they are trying to reach is on the move as well so it's like a big goose chase or a dangerous gave of hide and seek. ,5314,91,2019-04-13 21:35:39

In case you haven't read many of my reviews I have previously said subtly or casually and at times bluntly but perhaps most of all in harsh words bordering expletives expressing loathing of the deepest nature that I think shounen is bad. And by bad I mean garbage. And by that I mean definitive proof that humanity deserves to go extinct. And by that I mean that enjoying it should be carry a death sentence and sterilization of the parents of said hellspawn.,5337,100,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime in 24 episodes has been the best thing i've ever watched with charaters and story that make every episode better then the previous. The people who made the anime in my opinion have made a better anime then TTGL which i never thought possible and it saddens me that this anme wont have a season 2. I recomend this anime to anyone a fan of TTGL and every person who likes anime as this is really the greatest anime out there which i think anyone would enjoy.,5347,105,2019-04-13 21:35:39

So Kill La Kill...Is Awesome! Here are my thoughts...,5365,111,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Good anime must watch. Loved the anime hoped for a second season or a little theater show. If there any fan made show please tell me. I got to say kill la kill is one of the best anime I watch so far I hoped they make another anime that is like kill la kill and akame ga kill.,5369,112,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My first impressions of this anime were  it's good but not my favorite  so I continued watching expecting my opinion to stay relatively the same throughout. ,5372,113,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When the Kill la Kill PV came out I had high hopes for it. The fluid animation the music and the fact that the art style reminded me of my favorite anime drew me right in. When the second PV came out and it revealed the antagonist and the protagonist in those skimpy  battle  outfits I became skeptical but wasn't about to back down. I thought it wouldn't be that bad or in your face. And I was so wrong.,5374,114,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Disclaimer:,5375,115,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kill la Kill hands down made its way into my group of favorite animes very easily and quickly. Although Ryuko isn't my favorite of characters in the show like she may be for some others the whole cast as a whole is outstanding! Kill la Kill has enough variety so that everyone could be able to watch and take a liking to it so I won't be going into detail for those who may not have seen it. I highly recommend it to any and everyone!,5383,116,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pros: Good storyline. All the most important characters are female. Almost all of the characters are lovable. Novel alien invasion idea. Honestly really fun to watch. All the opening and ending songs are good.,5386,117,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,5391,118,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kill La Kill provides a glance into which I wish to be the future where fighting will be done without guns but with enhanced suits. The story behind this anime was slow but interesting. The characters (especially Mankanshoku) involved also made Kill La Kill one of my top watches.,5393,119,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I got onto Kill la Kill through a recommendation from a friend.  The show bad just barely started and he said he loves it.  Seeing that we have somewhat similar tastes I decided to give it a go.,5396,121,2019-04-13 21:35:39
***This is a spoiler free review***,5397,122,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Quite possibly one of the biggest titles of 2014 Kill La Kill has been hyped cosplayed merchandised and practically worshiped.  For me it fell short.,5398,123,2019-04-13 21:35:39
“Nonsensical is our thing.” -Ryuuko Matoi,5399,124,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kill La Kill is an anime you CAN NOT take seriously. Watch this anime if you are looking for a good time and something you can laugh at. It is shear ridiculousness with oversized cleavage graphically exhilarating fight scenes and a take on clothing which will blow your mind. This anime is not afraid of making its self a fool but don’t take its insanity for stupidity. This anime will have you sitting on the edge of your seat with its plots twists and clever story.,5400,125,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In essence this anime was a parody of anime itself and wasn't meant to be taken seriously. Those who do take it seriously and bash the anime need to reconsider calling themselves a fan of anime.,5401,126,2019-04-13 21:35:39
With an impressive creative bloodline to draw from Kill la Kill is visual feast for the senses. Were it a meal it'd be shooter sandwich: a ridiculous amount of delicious ingredients crammed into a small space squashed down to fit and then consumed with zero regrets. But is it a meal you'll want to go back and have again?,5402,127,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As of recent I’ve been sifting through my Netflix list of anime and came across this. After hearing much about it and glimpsing some well-cosplayed characters at conventions I gave Kill la Kill a shot. It definitely had the spice of “not what I was expecting…”,5408,129,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A decent enough anime entertaining enough but a bit too  forced  for my tastes. It is like it's trying to hard witch characters that I simply didn't find interesting or multi-dimensional (best example would be Satsuki) a horrible comic relief (Mako) pointless nudity silly plot and crappy animation.,5423,135,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Kill La Kill was very entertaining and very silly at times. The contrast of easy-going and giddy characters really distracted the viewer from what Ryuoko's ultimate goal was. What i really liked is that the plot line wasn't too easy to read in the sense that you couldn't guess everything that would happen. Though there were some generic and cliche aspects the entirety of it was fresh and original. I feel like more could have been done in terms of plot and length but in all the anime is worth watching and something you shouldn't pass up!,5439,138,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hanasakeru Seishounen,5449,141,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In any great anime there are a few intangible qualities you just might miss when you've got less experience with it. In many ways this can be a blessing because you come across a title like this one that on the surface is actually pretty good if you're still fresh into anime in general. Unfortunately the flip side is also true being that you begin to notice the little things that can unravel a perfectly good anime into one that just irks you too often. This title for me is such an example of what happens when you become so familiar with something that you notice all the little flaws turning a gem into a stone.,5454,142,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really great anime if your looking for a depth in both storyline and characters. Has some unexpected twists as well. Just kind of disappointed in the ending. Also wish it would gain enough notice to be dubbed soon. With as fast as things go by its easy to miss details in the story and the charater interaction if your watching the subtitles. Overall one great story. One to watch again and again!,5455,143,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was a little hesitant to watch this anime at first.  Honestly I only gave it a chance out of boredom.  The story seemed a little childish and well even after watching a few episodes I still didn't know whether I liked it or not.,5458,144,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story is simple - a high school student falls in love with his male teacher.  The interesting part and the part I appreciate the most here is that the teacher actually does try to refuse the student's feelings and when he finds that it's just not working he lays down the ground rule that they can't have a relationship until after the student is graduated from high school. ,5460,145,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The Characters were animated and initial premise is brilliant. The first episode had me hooked until the last minute. Went from a potentially hilarious slice of life to a pretty lame quest anime with a weak plot that pulls away from what I saw as a draw for the anime a group of wierd folks getting through high school. So much potential grossly dissapointing.,5466,148,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Oh lord this anime is something what I would describe with three words which actually doesn’t fit together. But I think only people who has seen it will understand it. It is: “Retarded but genius”. I must admit it was very interesting and I loved so many aspects of it but there were also aspects what I hated and what ruined experience for me. Please remember though while I try to stay neutral this is only my opinion and rating.,5473,152,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wakaba Girl is not exceptional but it does not make any serious mistake and is enjoyable for what it is short slice-of-life comedy. It has snowball in hell chance to have any lasting popularity. However as far as summer 2015 is concerned it is one of the more enjoyable series. Episodes are short 6 min with catchy opening song filled with silly Japanese comedy and jokes. ,5494,162,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Although it is by no means the greatest anime ever I have to pay homage to Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters as the anime that got me into anime. It's up there with Sailor Moon although it came slightly later. I can remember watching badly dubbed episodes of Sailor Moon as a very small child which eventually drew me back to anime as a teenager but it was Yu-Gi-Oh! that was on pretty much constantly between the ages of 6 and 12 by which time I had turned off the kiddie channels it played on. I watched them all as a kid; Pokemon Yu-Gi-Oh! Avatar: The Last Airbender (though technically not anime) Sailor Moon. If it was on Cartoon Network Boomerang or Jetix I watched it. And the score was boosted by two just for Yugi's hair.,5501,164,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Yu-Gi-Oh was one of my first anime and also one of the first manga series I read while it may sound embarrassing I am not afraid to admit that I still read the manga to this day. But this is a review of the anime so I should probably focus on that. Upon rewatching the first series over the past couple of months I can say that the cracks are showing in one of my favourite series. The story is nothing special the animation for all but the monsters (Which were animated well for their time) was somewhat minimal with downright careless mistakes and the characters were one-dimentional stereotypes.,5505,167,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The other day my little brother was watching it and i got a ton of childhood memories. So i watched a few episodes again and then i realized how bad it is. The story is SOOO SOOO repetitive the characters are boring the animation is ok considering how long ago this was made. But seriously the only thing thats interesting about this show is the dark magician girl card. Her outfit is so revealing i dont get why the creaters put her in the show.,5507,168,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was watching this series before I even knew what anime was. I was thrilled when I came across a website where I could watch all the episodes and zoomed right through them - eventually coming across the Japanese version thus beginning my love of anime (and my usual dislike of dubs.) When I was around thirteen I decided to watch some of it again...realizing just how dumb the show was.,5515,169,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,5520,170,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Yu-Gi-Oh! is a about a boy name Yugi who solved an Egyptian artefact call the Millennium Puzzle and by doing so melded his spirit with a 5000 year old Egyptian pharaoh. This pharaoh cannot remember anything about his past not even his name. Yugi plays a popular card game called duel monsters which players build a deck then battle each other until the opposition’s life points are depleted. After defeating the current world champion Seto Kaiba in an unofficial duel the card game’s creator Pegasus forces Yugi to enter this tournament by capturing his grandpa’s soul. Yugi must enter the tournament and defeat Pegasus to save his grandpa soul.,5521,171,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I consider Yu-Gi-Oh to be two different animes at times (perhaps and a Yami Anime and an Anime. Hehe.) Earlier in the story very childish most of the time. They were playing a game yay games. And Tea is far too chipper all the time in the first few episodes. But the story gets much darker and that is when it gets great. The darker the part of the anime the better it was. Maybe that is just me but the more Yugi was the Pharoh the more enjoyable the anime was. The antagonists get darker too as the story progresses. Well other than Von Forgot his name. He was kinda lame. Marik wanted the power of the Gods Bakura wanted power greater than that and then in between those two power hungry dark souls Kaiba's arch rival just wants to sell some games. I feel as though it could have been left out and the story would not have suffered much if at all. Back on point if you start this show I recommend you finish it because the end is by far the best portion of the anime and the first season maybe two seasons do it almost no justice at all.,5522,172,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Yugioh! Duel Monsters is one of my very first animes that I had watched. It's hard for me to say negative things about it.,5525,173,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,5526,174,2019-04-13 21:35:39
(My opinion everyone) ,5529,175,2019-04-13 21:35:39
THE STORY:,5530,176,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a soso anime because it has some good characters in it. I like that it has fairly good animation for an anime that was made in 2005-2006. But the story line is not as good as every thing else because it kind of jumps all over the place in my opinion. I don't know about much about the sound of other animes but this anime has some good sound in some places.,5534,177,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,5535,178,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I have to say this anime dissapointed me. It started out strong with good animation and some interesting character dynamics. The storyline seemed desesnt centered around revenge and character development but it started to become clear that the characters were more strightforword then I had originally thought and the storyline more simplistic. There were also some strange things done in terms of design with characters continuing to talk after a scene change or cuts to the future in the middle of a battle that made the last few episodes harder to follow. There were also parts of charcaters pasts I felt were left unexplained and the ending left the impression that nothing had really changed since episode 5. To top it all off the story moved at a staggering pace. Character developments happened in one episode and a new plot was introduced four episodes before the end of the series. It left me wishing there had been a filler or two. Despite all this this anime made me smile and laugh as much as some of my favorite anime (even if it didn't get me as attached to the characters.) Over all it was an okay way to kill some time but not much more.,5538,179,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is anime is really good and if your looking for a fighting anime with cool characters you should check this out. It has a cool number system which ranks the assassins in this anime and they have to fight against this clan/group that was put together to oppose them. A bit of romance in the beginning but nothing serious. The fighting scenes are amazing and the ending is okay I guess.,5539,180,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story:  The story was decent and I was definately entertained enough to watch the entire series.  However as far as plots go it was not particularly original nor was it incredibly well told.  It was an old story about an assassin who starts questioning his way of life and sets out on a journey to ultimately save the world.  I have seen this plot line done very well just not here. ,5540,181,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I first came across Black Cat purely by chance.  I just happened to be looking through one of the lastest issues of a certain cataloge when Black Cat caught my eye.  Not really knowing if it was any good or not I decided to take a completely blind leap of faith and bought the box set.  Much to my surprise it seemed that my intuition was right for once and I found myself rather enjoying the series.,5541,182,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,5542,183,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I believe a little above average is the best way to describe this anime. The whole concept is pretty neat but I feel like the series is lacking in just about every department.,5543,184,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,5544,185,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First I'd like to start of by saying Black Cat is the shiz. Now that I've got that out of the way on to the review! Lovely animation great and original story kick-ace characters great fight scenes and great music. truely Black Cat is one of those great shows you should really here more about. It's got comedy some very slight romance a few tear-jerking scenes and some great action. If you're looking for a romance anime move on but if ou want a funny(yet sometimes serious) action anime Black Cat's for you. Check it out! ~Tea,5545,186,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,5546,187,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Kinda sucks,5548,189,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The begining of the anime was great.  I like the story and the plot.  I like the characters and I really thought this had potiential.  It wasn't until the fo-end.  I honestly thought at one point in the anime when everything came together nicely it was the end.  Little did I know it was only 2/3 of the way through.  The rest of the anime was just weird and didn't work with what the entire anime was about.  I watched it to finish it but everyone I have talked to I let them know they can end at the 'first' end point without the need to watch the rest.,5549,190,2019-04-13 21:35:39
its one if not my favorite anime/manga its just to awsome atleast for me i love this kind of stuff the skilled gunsman and not to much more hes fighting superpowers and is still winning with  normal  ability it makes the whole thing alot more entertaining and ofc the black cat bad luck 13 gimmick gives it just more back story of the superstitious belife world and then mix it with alitle asian  woodoo  still the main character is simple nad a lilte dumb as they all are just to funny but got the skills that makes them a force not ment to be pushed ever,5550,191,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Black Cat was one of the first anime I watched alongside Pokemon Yugioh! Kiddy Grade and Basilisk. As such this show is held especially dear to my heart. Anyways I found that despite the fact that the anime left out much of the manga they found a way to make the show and story enjoyable despite the filler episodes/hiccups they had along the way. The contrast of characters between Train Sven Rinslet and Eve all help to make the main cast an enjoyable spectacle to behold. As for the actual story itself Train's quest for revenge and Creed's desires for world domination and Train's (love? friendship? Skills? I kinda felt that Creed had a seemingly romantic direction towards Train.) conflicts are very interesting and the back stories that appear and develop throughout the show kept my interest from beginning to end. However since the show had those meddling hiccups along the way I have to give Black Cat an 8.5-9.0/10,5551,192,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Anime and Manga alike both hold a deep and sedimental story that everyone should enjoy from nanotech to tao this is packed with action and cute princesses that everyone should indulge 10/10 from me any day.,5552,193,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love the storyline of this anime following a coldblooded killer who turns out to become a gentle person who would do anything for his friends and the comedy in this anime just makes it even better.,5553,194,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,5554,195,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Black Cat surprised me; I found it to be quite good. The show's premise is ait shaky our protagonist an assassin by the code name Black Cat is amongsthe  Numbers  of an organization that basically controls the worldalled Chronos. He decides to take control of his life and basically the wholehing is about his redemption and what each character believes to be justice. It’simple but it worked well enough.,5555,196,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If your a yugioh 5ds fan I recommend it its a good yusei vs jack duel .   I won't spoil anything but I will say it has cards I never saw as far as the main 5ds series goes and its enjoyable seeing those cards in action .,5556,197,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Had a great premise but I felt like they botched it a bit.  I think it would have been much better if they had gone darker with the characters and style.  For example there were many ridiculous looking characters and fanfare-like music that diminished the integrity of the horrific events going on.  It ended up becoming something like a murder mystery 90s cartoon rather than a horrifying Hunger Games type massacre which was what I thought was intended when I began and was looking forward to. Most of the episodes had the same basic format that I got bored with- find a body look for clues trial moving on. I didn't really enjoy the characters either despite the fact that they all had unique looks. I did enjoy some of the darker parts near the beginning when they were first introduced to the disturbing monobear and what he was capable of. The animation was pretty boring.  I thought the ending was pretty good because I wasn't expecting much.  There were some nice metaphors in the end which is one of my favorite parts of watching anime. I wouldn't watch again but I would probably skim the manga to see if it's more serious. ,5559,200,2019-04-13 21:35:39

SECRET SANTA PARTICIPATION REVIEW,5561,202,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I can't do this review justice because it does not compare to the video game that corresponds to it.,5563,203,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,5564,204,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ridiculous. Childish. Completely and utterly moronic. Lacking any depth or philosophy. Forcefully unsubtle. Danganronpa Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation is definitely all of those and then some. Still I can't bring myself to hate it no matter how much I want to. It is a hybrid of the  play or die  genre and courtroom drama with a high school flavor to boot. It has all the cliches you'd expect in all of them.,5565,205,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,5566,206,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Danganronpa is one of the best animes I have ever seen. I really hope that they make a second season based of the game Danganronpa Goodbye Despair like they did this one. The story plot is amazing and find yourself chosing charaters to survive and the punishments they get make you feel bad even if you did not like it a first. Anyway 10 out of 10 would watch again and again. ,5567,207,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm going to start by saying that as soon as I found this anime under the 'Psychology' genre tag and read the summary and saw the cover I watched it instantly and got dragged into it by the end of the first episode.,5571,211,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I honestly wasn't expecting much of this anime to begin with. The only thing that kept my interest was mostly the story. After hearing many people knock down the developers of this anime and what a history they have I really wasn't expecting much but it was a decent ride.,5572,212,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Dangan ronpa is a great anime for anyone that loves mystery horror and adventure (kinda?). The story is basically about Neagi who enters Hope Peak Academy because of luck but when he gets there he gets dizzy and passes out when he wakes up he is told that he is stuck in the academy and to get out he has to kill one of the other 14 students that joined with him.,5581,217,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Before watching this show be aware that it is a shounen-ai series. Based on the manga of the same name little it does to demarcate itself from others pitfalls of the genre. The story is somewhat simple and previsible. It is REALLY episodic and this is a no good. Some episodes just fell like fillers who follows the same pattern. The main character meet a someone. That person succombs to darkness. The main character beats him to pulp and it is a happy ending. Seriously. What a joke.No creativity.,5587,222,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Saw the dubbed version so firstly i'd like to diss on their atempts on sounding irish/scottish whatever it wasn't necessary at all. The story was too common for my tastes a lot of animes have this kind of fighting for liberty plot didn't really draw me in. As for the characters they spoke way too long when they weren't suppose to their castle is being torn down and the first warrior dude is yapping like crazy. Apart from that it did have a few good moments but very few. Story didn't really pick up until about episode 6. I wouldn't highly recommend it but if your into knights and sword fights and myths and such give it a shot not really good but not really bad either. By the way the demon king guy had like one hundred trillion wives yet no one showed their affection except that reannon chick,5588,223,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The most interesting aspect of the show is how the story plays with legends and myths. It takes parts of the Legend of King Arthur the Bible and elves fairies and dragons twists them a bit and makes them completely original. The beginning is a little slow but picks up about half-way in where real characterization and action take place. There's a few surprising turns to make you impressed and the ending is very satisfying. Not the greatest story ever told but very much worth watching.,5589,224,2019-04-13 21:35:39

       Tears is a fantasy action series. However when it began it was looking more like a harem. Every episode a new female came in. But it seems the writers eventually forgot they were writing a harem and made it interesting again.,5593,226,2019-04-13 21:35:39
An introductory analogy. Tears to Tiara is the child of a beautiful artist and a brilliant writer but as a child it only smacks brushes on a canvas and scribbles with a pencil. Tears to Tiara is an interesting plot-line based on Arthurian legend that falls short due to the horrible  melodramatic  moments that infest the series like a crack-riddled prostitute on the bad side of town.,5594,227,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Shows like these are the reason why I stay in on the weekends,5597,228,2019-04-13 21:35:39
" Anime based on an ero-game featuring  a man of a mysterious origin leading a small tribe of oppressed people to fight the empire... Where did I heard of a such a setttin... Ah but of course - Utawarerumono!  - that could sum up my first thoughts of this show. Up to ep 7 (or somewhere around that) I believed this show would just be a cheap Utawarerumono rip-off . Fortunately I was proven wrong. It's true that both animes share number of similarities but in the end Tears to Tiara somehow manages to create it's unique story - a weird mix of Arthurian legends ancient Rome setting and some christian mythology figures.",5600,229,2019-04-13 21:35:39
An excellent epic fantasy series. It borrowed heavily from the classic Arthurian legend but managed to weave a unique tale that ran a lot like a D&D campaign with a small band of heroes hacking and slashing through waves of enemies.,5602,230,2019-04-13 21:35:39
By far one of the best anime shows that i have ever been fortunate enough to watch. All aspects of the series was outstanding the story the animation and characters all played a vital role in making this anime great. I could see no negative part to mention in the show and therefore gave it a perfect 10/10.,5603,231,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Skip beat this is an anime I do not know where to start. When the first volume came out of the manga i distinctly remember buying it just for the hell of. I was pretty young at the time and then I happened to find this anime many years later [2010ish] and vaguely had a memory of reading the first volume but never continued for some strange reason. I watched it ..now four times and counting ,5631,250,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Im not the type person to like all the celebrity hype but this story and actors really played well for me. I cant explain the reasoning so well but just know that if the  snob celebrity  personality turns you off at first (or you think thats what this anime is about)... its not really that big of a deal. I was suprised at how good this anime was.,5632,251,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,5636,252,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wonderful Anime!!!!! The story is Awesome....... Kyoko is wonderful. She is at the beginning sometwhat boring and seems to only think about Sho but at the end her acting skills bring out her true character. Also Ren is her arch enemy but yet there is definately romance going on between them. If you are a lover of romance anime I definately recommend this. Im an actor so this also helped me in that aspect too!,5640,253,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story:Watch the anime THEN read the manga. the anime is like that Manga however it's a pale imatation to it. much like a producer decided that they needed to hit the fast foward button in seveal spots. Leaving out alot of character developmetn for both major and minor characters.,5643,254,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I've never done drugs but I imagine this series is a lot like crack cocaine.  Once you start you can't live without the next episode.  I have seen this anime over and over again no joke at least fifteen times.  When I don't know what to watch I rewatch it.  It's absolutely hillarious and it doesn't get less funny.  The characters are great finally a really strong leading lady in Kyoko!,5644,255,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I overall really enjoyed this anime. However seeing as there was only one season (with an open ending) I couldn't be satisfied with it. No real change between the characters no advancement in the sense that their love evolves. That was all really upsetting because they could have been great together given the time to grow. They didn't get that time and that is sad for me.,5653,263,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Personally I rather dislike Shoujo anime so when my fiancé and I sat downo watch Skip Beat! Last winter I was not particularly enthused.  I hadound the anime on this site and saw it well recommended so I figured if Iad to suffer through a Shoujo at least make it a good one. Boy was I ever pleasantlyurprised by this anime.,5665,270,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As far as Lupin movies/OAV's/TV Specials go this is a steady Lupin title. It pulls all the right lupin-ish momnets and even has a great comical escape But it does foray into something that many Lupin series do not go. Instead of just a treasure and a baddy who wants it the Lupin jumps for a little bit of the supernatural.  In fact it does this so much better than the Pycal special. ,5673,274,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Just a Short Review,5682,280,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One of the most annoying things about the anime industry is the seemingly ingrained belief that bandwagons when jumped upon have the mystical ability to carry studios into money. It's a sad fact that every season will undoubtedly see the release of one or more shows that clearly attempt to piggyback on the success of something that has gone before. Thankfully following trends isn't necessarily a bad thing and every so often a series comes along that can be considered a superior example of its genre.,5684,281,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Shows like these are the reason why I stay in on the weekends,5686,282,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I marathoned this anime for the October (Catch up with Summer) Monthly Marathon. It was a rather fast paced anime with enough of a plot to keep it interesting and enough character development to make it enjoyable.,5687,283,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,5688,284,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It is decent. It's not much to write home about. Animation sound the general design is decent no really peaks or valleys in terms of quality.,5689,285,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Overall it is not to bad and from the looks of things is going to follow the manga version. Still it is nice to see an animated version of a good manga(god only knows how many good manga gets turned into an animation) for those who like romantic comedies Then you might like this show. and for those who are a fan of the manga it's not to bad just needs slightly better animation(though that could just be my interenet) otherwise it is not bad. I myself look forward to seeing how the anime version turns out.,5690,286,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story was lack luster and for a hearm anime I think you need a good background plot in order to keep the story going. The main character never got around to choosing a mate and even though there were some very comprimising situations I found the sex factor of this anime meh at best. I did however enjoy the fan services aspects of the anime and the animation itself was top notch but considering this was also not that funny as a comedic hearm I find myself feeling blah. Overall if you're bored have nothing interesting to watch at present I would recommend givng this a watch but it's not a must see among hearms. ,5691,287,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok so having watched 6 episodes of this show thus far and read a little of the manga. This show has it's momments.,5693,288,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First of all I just wanna disclaim that I have never been a big fan of ecchi / harem animes but I'm going to try to review it either way!,5713,292,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Read the manga then when i had heard that there was going to be an anime adaptation kinda got excited. but as soon as it came out i still had a little bit of hype within me but when i watched it it kinda caught me off-guard i mean the story was still good and the characters i knew and love were still good (to me at least) but i still l liked it but some of the content from to manga was removed (read the manga and you will see what i mean)... but all in all in my opinion it was still good and i would... well... kinda recomend this (50/50) to SOME people but not everyone but its still good im my opinion.,5715,293,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: As interesting as the premise sound Rokka no Yuusha partly fails to deliver it. One day a man known as Adlet proclaiming himself to be the strongest man receives the mark of the six braves and then goes on to journey with Nashetania to gather all of the other Braves to defeat the demon god. When all of the Braves are gathered we end up with 1 extra Brave who is presumably the fake and that they are all trapped in a temple. At that point the story starts to deteriorate. The plot gets derailed quite a bit from the main goal when it becomes a game of who did it ? Progress gets stalled and the pacing takes a turn for the worse to end up been atrocious. Adlet is accused of been the fake since he was at the wrong place in the wrong time conveniently enough so he is forced to clear his guilt. The mystery behind the 7th Brave is poorly handled when the show is forced to bring some very critical off-screen evidence to solve the case so it's not very grounded either which is a minus considering it dragged the whole show for quite sometime. It turns out that the 7th Brave was the princess all along. Once the fog clears up what we get is more recycling of what was previously mentioned so we get an 8th Brave without a satisfying conclusion. It may seem like I am raining down a lot on this adaption but I found a large portion of the plot to be decent. ,5717,294,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is my Finalversion of review,5719,295,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I started this anime think I was going to love it but ended up being dissappointed. ,5723,296,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So... it starts out fabulous.  Without giving the story away the MC enters the stage in a fashion that can only be called lame badassery (no really it's a thing).  The idea of the story itself is interesting: there should only be six but there's seven... someone is a fake.,5725,297,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Didnt really know what to think of this at first it played out differently then what the descriptions said but I imagine it will get a second series as this seemed like it was just doing all the backstory that doesn't mean it was bad though the story is easy to understand but when watch it and it gets going its make you constantly guess about everything after each episode I had a new character as a suspect and they and turned out wrong. The story itself is nothing new but the way in which its gone about itself makes it look like this season will be the highlight of the show. I found the the characters to be likeable with one standout and one I didn't really like at all the sound quality and animation were very good and I loved the opening and end credits. When I was watching it some of the comments said it was too slow and boring but I thought the pacing was good as it left a lot of good character development and just because it's a slow starter doesn't mean it will be bad look at steins gate for example. This first series was very good but I can't see the second (if they make one) being any better although there is still a mystery more then likely it will revisit one character and we haven't had an actual fight yet. Still has a lot of promise to be great I loved it and it's easy to get hooked on for a short series.,5733,298,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First thing I thought of when I saw the cover is   Oh look another fan service fighting anime . I was sorely mistaken... the  Art style Story and Character Development has got me hungry for more and more! The amount of work put into the background and textures makes it feel like a movie. The only thing that bugs me is the animated monsters seem out of place in the environment.,5734,299,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Rokka no Yuush is the second most misleading anime of summer 2015. It tries to make you think it is an action anime but instead it is a mystery anime. ,5762,306,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Imagine if in the Lord of the Rings when fellowship of the ring arrives at the Rivendel the ring was stolen and Frodo started to investigate who stole it. You would get similar mystery like Rokka no Yuusha. After watching two or three episodes of Rokka no Yuusha I got impression this is going to be an action/fantasy. Instead it turned in 4th episode into stale mystery. While it delivers surprising resolution in the last episode it trolls viewers by pointing out how meaningless the whole issue actually was and leaves the ending opened for a next season. Animation is decent. However the fiends are cgi and it is off putting. Sound and bg music is ok but op/ed sucks I skip both all the time. Characters are good even if I have to say I hated Adlet and I still hate the guy. He is rightly called an idiot by other characters. I appreciate some effort to give him some proper background but most charcters in this anime feel little bit gimmicky.,5773,310,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Kino's Journey is unique from other amine’s that it doesn't have any of theypical standards that usually pull a person in to a show. Gratuitous amountsf violence and/or sex are absent as well as the the typical cast card boardutout anime girls with rainbow florescent hair and puppy dog eyes. In fact yourobably won't realize that the main character (Kino) is a girl until youctually watch it. The animation is plain the sound sparse and the charactersnderdeveloped. This is because all these things are play back seat to what ishe real focus of the anime deeply profound exploration of the questions thatt the core of humankind.,5814,323,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story – 9,5819,324,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I came across this by recommendation from a friend.  We were talking about anime and he talked about this really cool basketball anime.  He didn't really go into detail and just told me to watch it.,5821,325,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love this anime!! this is my top anime. This snime is about a guy named kuroko who used to be from the generation of mircles ( i think thats how u spell it) and has gone to a school who has had only 1 year of basketball. there he meets kagami who is a player who came from america and comes to the school wich kuroko is in. kagami then challanges kuroko to 1 on 1 and kuroko loses leaving kagami thinking that he has no talent whatsoever. but later on in a practice game kagami discovers kuroko's real talent. this froms a great relation ship between these two.,5826,326,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So... This will be a review for all the Kuroko no Basuke seasons but there won't be spoilers as I won't talk much about the plot so go ahead and read this: (note: this is my subjective opinion and feeling of course this is not for everybody the same!),5828,327,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kuroko's Basketball focuses on a school that only formed one year prior to when the story takes place. While the team didn't do well they regarded their first year a personal victory as they weren't expected to do much at all. ,5829,328,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Do you love basketball? You want to watch great anime about your favorite sport?! Well... then go for Slam Dunk (or eventually Dear Boys).,5830,329,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was told about this anime from a friend and was all like nope no way I will never watch a sport anime since I find watching sport in real life pretty boring but boy was I wrong.,5832,330,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a really good anime. I love this anime because it has a really good story line to it. I love that the main characters have one main goal that they have to get to. Although I don't like that sometimes there are some  filler  kind of episodes because it just disrups the flow of the main story line. The animation of this anime is so awesomely epic. I love the details of the characters and the scenary. I like the songs that they have in this anime. I also love the voices of some of the characters. I love most of the character because they are really awesome people. But there are some characters that I don't like and they should just disaper and never come back.,5833,331,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I swear this anime has the most annoying soundtrack ever. The metallic screeches do not pump me up for a scene. No. It just hurts my ears and distracts me from the story.,5834,332,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First of all im not really a sports anime or basket ball fan for the most part but Kuroko's Basketball was definitely enjoyable for me.,5835,333,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A friend of mine recommended this anime and I thought I would not like it as I am not into sports so much. However after watching one single episode I was hooked. Then I watched the entire two seasons within a week! Usually it takes me a bit longer to get sucked into the story but this grabbed me right away. Story: Highschool Seiren acquires some new players for their basketball team one called Kuroko (the sixth phantom member of the Generation of Miracles) and the other is Kagami - who learned how to play basketball in America. They both want to make a strong team and become number one in Japan like the others in Seirins team. The interaction between the characters is well thought out logical and it has a lot of funny moments but above all exciting moments. Even though I kind of knew they had to win a certain game they manage to keep me at the tip of my seat wondering if they really will and if so how. The animation is beautiful with powerful bursts and powerful looking men. All in all I enjoyed this anime so much I just had to share my opinion and to recommend it. This is the first time I leave a review on an anime but this deserves it. Waiting for season 3 @ march 2015!,5838,334,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,5841,335,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First of all animation gets better and better towards the end of the series. Also season 2 has a much improved animation quality!,5842,336,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,5844,337,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a really good anime. I love it because it has a good story line to it because it follows one main plot/story line and they stick to it instead of adding in alot of filler epsiodes like other animes do. I like the animation of this anime because it is really good and there are alot of details to it. The sound of the anime is good because of the music and the voices of some of the characters. The characters of this anime are really awesome people but some of the people I wish that I never meet because they are so curel but others are really terific. I also like that they are basketball players.,5845,338,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have always hated any sports anime that I have watched.  Slam Dunk Prince of Tennis and more.  I get them recommended to me and attempt to watch them but they just usually end up making me want to quit watching anime.  I still have not to this day found a sports-genre anime that I enjoyed.  Then I saw that a new anime called Kuroko's Basketball was at the number three spot on Crunchyroll's popular page.  I have a habit of at least testing out the top ten most popular anime every week on Crunchyroll.  However I had had such a bad experience with sports anime in the past that I kept skipping over it.  But it kept being in that top ten week after week.  I fanally decided that I would at least try the first episode not expecting much.  I was blown off my feet.  Before I knew it I was on the seventh episode.  I couldn't figure it out.  Why after hating all the rest of the most famous sport anime was I loving this show so much?  After much pondering I've come to a conclusion.  Kuroko's Basketball is not in fact a sports anime.  It is simply an extremely well done action anime in disguise as a sports anime.  So if you don't like sports anime or only prefer action you will still almost certainly enjoy this show.  You also do not have to have any prior knowledge of Basketball to like the show or even like basketball.  Anyway time for the actual review.,5849,340,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok so I just got done with this anime yesterday and loved it!!! Honestly I am not a big of the genre sports but I just gave it chance and I'm glad I did! I love the character devolopment with the Generation of Miracles (my fav is Midorima :3) and not only them the Seirin teamates were awsome too (my fav beside Kuroko and Kagami is Izuki <3) Let's start with Kuroko omg can you say ADORABLENESS!! Aww with his big light blue eyes and his emotionless but innocent look (when he's not angry xD) Kise the pretty boy many people underestimate him because SPOILER!!!!! he lost to Aomine but still feel he really strong and should be more praised. Midorima ahhhh I kyaa everytime I see him! He just has this unique look to him that gets me going! I hate his personality though I hate dudes with too much confidence but it's to be expected from a guy who's in the Gerenations of Miracles. Aomine now I couldn't wait to see him play like before he appeared on the show and you just saw his cameo he seemed so strong and unstoppable I also thought this dude was going to be a huge a%@*# but I grew to like him alot but I didn't like how momoi was all over him (that hoe...) Then Murasakibara!!! God I love saying that name Ok I thought this dude was going to be a complete a#@%*& too but he was actually a silly kinda stupid eats alot boy. I can't say much about him because we've never seen him play (unless you read the manga) but just from his size I can tell he has alot of strength and he can block. Now Akashi I can't say much about except he's sadistic and his two colored eyes are just too epic.,5854,341,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't know what people see in this anime... Yeah 1 season was good but this season is a joke ... The beginning of this season ( I mean here 15 episodes :c ) was really poor.,5859,342,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really enjoyed this Anime but I felt it could have been a lot better. ,5865,344,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I still never understand the massive amount of hype behind this show other then the fact that its about being stuck/put fully into a gaming world. Which that in itself would be awesome except for the whole premise of this show is that it may cause death or otherwise unforseen outcomes. ,5868,345,2019-04-13 21:35:39
usually i get dissapointed after watching second season but this one looks very well. story is fun to watch too bad there is no romancebut still very good series,5869,346,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I must say I was hesitant to watch the second season after seeing the first.  The first season was a great idea but the execution of it (the flow) was terrible.  However I decided that I wanted to know what happened and if some plot holes were filled so I watched.,5873,350,2019-04-13 21:35:39

What a boring series. The build up was ok for the first two episodes but then it started to drag on. It needs more action. The action scenes are instense and fun to watch. ,5876,353,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I didn’t enjoy this second season as much as the first and I think a part of the reason for that is the flaws and plotholes of the show become more and more apparent the farther you get. Not to say I still don’t enjoy the first season (especially the first arc) but with much of the first season I enjoyed it enough that the plotholes didn’t really detract from my experience.,5877,354,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This seems like a repeat of the first one for me. There first arc is really good but the 2nd arc just brings the whole thing down. I like the storyline of the first arc and it has really nice animation with likeable characters. The only downside for me was the whole kirito looking like a girl but I can look past it.

YES YES YES! I just reciently finished this season of SAO and I gotta say it was  worth watching! I enjoyed every episode (even the slower ones) this time around. The first season I  had alittle trouble  loving  the second half of the season but with this one I didn't have that issue at all. The story was there and it was great. The animation was slightly lacking but well I've seen worse lol. The ending though on the sadder side was (to me) a good edition as well. Overall this season in my opinion was much better as a whole than the first season. I'm very much looking forward to seeing season 3 if and when it is released!,5908,367,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First half of the story very compelling thing I liked they tend to do really strong intro's into the stories of these kinda new games they're getting into specially ith so much coming off the first series.,5909,368,2019-04-13 21:35:39
 one of the best animes ever seen :),5914,369,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sword Art Online... You know I hear alot of fanboys say that the second season is much better than the first but I disagree. When I started watching this season I told myself that I'm not taking anyone's word for it and will let the show speak for itself. If you ask me Sword Art Online should've ended after y'know Sword Art Online. Even if Aincrad was a terrible arc it would've ended with at least some dignity. But nope Fairy Dance just had to drive whatever dignity it had into the ground.,5916,370,2019-04-13 21:35:39
absolutly loved it! at first  i though oh this is going to be so bad. BUT NO! it includes exictment romance andventure and a detailed story but even if you havent watched the first season you can still understand. definatly worth watching XD,5917,371,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sword Art Online 2 starts off fairly strong branching off into a new genre works well and it's really cool to see at least Kirito interacting with a new and different type of world. The first half of this arc is really interesting and the pacing for it is very well done you get enough of a feel for the world that you know whats going on but aren’t bored that its going too slow that completely changes in the arc’s 2nd half. Immediately when they get to the Ballet of Bullets the story slows to a crawl with that one event lasting 8 episodes.,5922,375,2019-04-13 21:35:39
First off everyone is entitled to their own views and I respect everyone for what they will comment below or have already reviewed this anime as.

I'm actually not a big anime fan I'm real picky or I have a tendency to just drop amines half way thru or force myself to watch em.      season 1 was pretty good when it came to romance season 2 not as much romance more suspense. It starts off slow but it always ends with suspense and even the character develop ment is pretty good. They don't just one episode tell you everything about em it builds up even near the end your kinda like how didn't I see that coming. I personally realy liked this one it's the only anime I actually watch once the new episode come out. Instead of waiting for it to end the season. asuna is not in this one but sinon is just as cute to watch as a replacement. That's just my thoughts on this anime watch season 1 if you liked it watch season 2 if you didn't don't watch season 2.,5928,381,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Everyone? Hello there!,5931,384,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To start off with I'm not overhyped with this anime. I did love the first arc (SAO) of season 1 but dislike the second arc due to the over-the-top romance between Kirito and Asuna.,5933,385,2019-04-13 21:35:39
There isn't much to be said about SAO 2 that hasn't already been said by most reviews here. However the reason i found the motivation to write this review is because i found some enjoyment in the final arc that deserves some recognition. ,5934,386,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Best way to get back into anime after a period of HBO binging. Fantastic anime with everything you could ask for in entertianment storytelling and character development.  The only downside is realizing this is a sequel to Fate/Stay Night and being INCREDIBLY dissapointed with the original show...I will grind my way through it though.

 A very light hearted anime about teenage angst. When a teenage girl   arrives from tokyo to a small island in the outskirts of japan. Our   main male characters get quite taken with the new transfer student not   only for love but there money as well. Our main female character seems   to minpulate the boys for the chance to sneek her way back to tokyo   but when she is found out our main male charcter is once again   minpulated and dragged off to tokyo. Oh the things we do for love. As   the story moves fowards all of our characters are going there seperate   ways only to find themselves rekindle friendships and possibly loves   after high school. I feel that it could have needed more time for   growth and backstory for the charcters giving it a stronger plot. I   would have like to see this be a series or the possiblilty of an OVA.   Voice acting is run of the mill. Nothing to strong but nothing week.   Sountrack also run of the mill I mean it did come out in 1993! You   would think The Place Promised in Our Early Days sountrack in 2004   would have learned better. Overall I think we see a nice early 90's   effort from the studio that brings some of the finest anime to the   table (spirit away). Definatly  slice of life .,5956,397,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Garbage. That’s what happens when you leave film production to overambitious young animators. Apparently they exceeded the budget and left Studio Ghibli fans to chow down on a tasteless piece of animation. I was bored even the characters in the film looked bored.,5957,398,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ocean Waves might just be the most realistic anime I've watched or close to. Or the most realistic slice-of-life. Either way or both it's so realistic that it boarders and crosses the line to Mundane County which is both a good and bad thing. It also means that it's slow real slow. But that slowness adds to the mundane also a good/bad thing.,5958,399,2019-04-13 21:35:39

this anime the plot was intersting but the animation i did not really like. the story goes on about a poor girl who goes to a school full of rich kids and the f4. The f4 is a group of the school riched kids and they are always bulling others. But the main character stood up to them the leader started to fal in love with her. And she started to fall for Rui (i think that is his name) and the cdrama started,5978,405,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Okay so this anime is hilarious! Like I can watch this all day and not get tired. There is so many funny moments in this anime that just makes me happy and that's such a plus. I know plenty of people wouldn't like this anime just because it's old or the animation is crappy etc. like honestly I don't regret watching it. Like its so dramatic that it's funny. If you're going for a serious anime this wouldn't be for you... but I still think you should watch it. Esp. if you're a goof ball like me then most definitely watch! :) :) :) :) ,5983,406,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I watched this anime non-stop front beginning to end it left me wanting more out of it with the plot twist and turns.  Sadly the girl is too stupid for her own good I was expecting more romance out of it and was sadly dissapointed. For being an older series they did pretty well with the graphics and storyline overall I give it an 8.,5992,411,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First of all if you are not a big GITS fan turn back now this is not a movie for you!,5997,415,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Innocence is one of the best animated and most mind numbing anime features I have watched.  Removing most of the comedy that fills the previous movie and the subsequent series Innocence ends up as a very serious and rather pretentious movie.  What makes this movie pretentious is a combination of too much complex dialogue along with a never ending stream of “quotes.”  These conversations usually touch on the usual GitS questions concerning dolls their ghosts whether they are really alive what makes a person alive what makes them real at what point does a person lose their humanity etcetra. I think you get the picture.  Now exploring this fascinating world that Masamune Shirow has created is one of the most intriguing parts of the GitS franchise.  Except when a 90 minute movie is almost entirely taken up with these long dialogues and quote battles which makes it all just seem rather tiresome.  That isn’t to say the conversations aren’t interesting they are thought provoking and well thought-out as one would expect but one can only take so much.   This time around with the Major MIA the story focuses on the newly formed partnership between Batou and Togusa the problems they face as a team and their mission to figure out why sexaroids are killing their masters.  The actual storyline is not that complex; it just seems complex due to the psychobabble being spewed almost continuously.  It almost seems like the storyline took a backseat to having philosophical conversations about the storyline if that makes any sense.  Though I may make it seem like there is nothing but talking that wouldn’t be wholly correct.  Action while spare is present throughout the movie but is never really long enough or engaging enough to satisfy action junkies like myself and with such stunning animation those fights could have been such a beautiful thing.   Considering that Innocence was released in 2004 one can only be thoroughly impressed with the quality of its animation.  It achieves a very dark and intense look and feel missing from the other GitS incarnations.  Maybe they wanted to match the more serious tone of the movie with its animation but the effect is quite apparent.  However with such beautiful animation it would have been nice if they would have used it to do more action scenes rather than wasting it on watching people as they talk to one another.   Sadly for whatever reason Innocence did not receive an English dub in the United States.  It did get an English dub in the United Kingdom so I really don’t know what the problem was.  Supposedly they are going to release a version with an English dub at some point but I do not know when.  On a happier note the old Japanese dub crew is back to reprise their roles from the original movie and they are more than adequate for their respective parts.   Also reprising his role is Kenji Kawai who did the music for the first movie and now Innocence.  Using a number of chorus scores with the haunting melody of children singing to the backdrop of such a serious feature is quite a combination that I found worked very well together.  In addition to these haunting melodies we have a number of songs sung in English with a jazz vibe to them for the slower more relaxed moments in the film.   Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence is a fine follow-up to the classic Ghost in the Shell movie with spectacular animation and a wonderful music score.  However while the technical merits shine Innocence suffers from a lack of action and an overall feeling that the movie finds itself a little too important for its own good.,5998,416,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story is a little cliche. Kaoru and Ranmaru are marrying so that their family businesses (two Yakuza gangs) will become one. It is assumed that the two have known each other since they were children. While on their honeymoon Ranmaru is seduced and sleeps with Al a dashing blonde Italian. This could be the plot of any gushy romance novel with a yaoi twist. The second episode gives a little more intrigue and perhaps a little more depth to Al. Ranmaru is still pretty thick-headed. Though I still say the plot was taken from a dime-store smut book.,6025,426,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ikoku Irokoi Romantan was pretty bland. The story was easy to follow but it wasn't anything unique. The animation was okay. I thought the voice actors were alright and their English was pretty hilarious. I didn't really like the characters much. Al seemed too perfect. Just a rather generic yaoi for the sake of yaoi.,6028,427,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I rather liked Ikoku Irokoi Romantan. It was pretty generic but this is yaoi - it's all generic. Although I have to say I did laugh hysterically when the Japanese voice actors tried to speak with Italian or American accents. That will never stop being hilarious. As per usual it goes by the one sex scene per episode thing and both of them are pretty steamy. If you like your BL with added Italian go for this.,6030,428,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Kaiba is a weird anime. I started watching it once some time ago and dropped it. But I left it there on my desktop waiting for the right moment to give it another go. It stayed there for quite a long time more than a year probably. Anyway recently I tried watching it again. And I'm trying to write a review now. Rather than a review which I don't feel capable of writing properly I'll just jot down my impressions. Oh and while at a first glance due to the animation style it looks like a children's anime rest assured that it isn't.,6033,431,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime could be the best or worst thing you have ever watched. It depends on your tastes and personal preferences when it comes to anime. The whole anime is driven by sword clashing and exaggerated fights. The main problem with this anime is the length: over 300 episodes of which 100 are original to the anime and pretty much bullshit. If your going to watch this anime i advise going online and finding an episode guide so you can skip these episodes as the events that happen during these episodes are almost never referenced after the arc has finished.,6061,440,2019-04-13 21:35:39

**First off I just want to mention that this is currently a review for just the Soul Society Arc of Bleach (Seasons 2 and 3) what I consider to be the  main  part of the series; later I plan on coming back and rewriting this review into three separate parts: Pre-SS SS Arc and Post SS Arc (aka Arrancer Arc and on not including fillers) as I view each part of the series to be completely different from the others. I plan on rounding all of the scores to come up with the  final  marks that appear at the top; as such expect the final scores to plummet signficantly as compared to what they are now.**,6064,443,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I remember when I was 12 or 13 and I was watching Adult Swim on channel 59.

Bleach is a good Anime to watch if you are looking forward to Comedy and Action. The Story line may be abit weird But its alright. It will make you laugh and It may make you cry. It a sad story but in the end Everybody has made friends with each other. Everyone is usually happy and its a fun story for Teens to watch. ((-I wouldnt Advise Little kids to watch it unless they have parents permission because of the Cleavage and Language.)) But it is a easy story to follow but it will take you a while to watch it. In conclusion Bleach is a good story for teens to watch.,6069,447,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I started watching bleach because of all the comments i've heard. Some common comments i received were:  Bleach is awesome  or  You have to watch bleach  or  When you watch bleach it will be your favorite anime  Well NO. Because of these comments I got online and from my friends i decided to give it a shot.,6071,448,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Bleach is one of the first anime i have ever watched. To me the story is really well written and the characters are epic and very likable. I love the soundtracks and the opening/endind songs. The art is amazing and the animation is done well. Bleach is my favorite anime.,6072,449,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well first off Bleach has a lot of suspense and exciting moments. In the earlier episodes it's sort of boring since you have yet to know everything about the spirit world. Just beating up hollows and getting to know about the spirit world. ,6073,450,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Bleach the on going monster that covers so many sagas I could explode. In breif there are Shinigami (death Gods) and Hollow (basically the evil spirits) it’s a death gods job to stop the hollows. More characters and challenges are introduced at the moment we see Ichigo battling Aizen in his arrancar form while remaining in his hollow form whether your a fan of manga or anime this will tickle anyones fancy,6077,454,2019-04-13 21:35:39
bleach is good anime because it has moments when it leaves you suspence but where it falters is where it goes to la la land in a complatly diffrent story it leaves you confused for a while untill you realise whats going on and i know a couple of bleach fans that have dropped this awesome anime for the same reason thats why i would only give the story a 7.5 ,6078,455,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Bleach is one of the best action animes you'll ever see.Although I wish the storyline was more defined such as Naruto's it is still great!The action is on a different scale of awsome and you can't help but love majority of the characters(Aizen can rot in hell) you can't wait for the next episode to drop everytime they always stop right when it gets good(Such a teaser)but it's all worth it.When it all comes down to it this show will never dissappoint your anime craving in fact it will only make it stronger the more you get into it.Watch it and you'll fall in love with it and thats how it is supposed to be.-Hellzblade,6093,459,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Bleach was the first series I ever watched and as good as it was it started to drag out a little with a lot of filler arcs that seemed like they were made in 10 minutes despite this it has a lot of likeable characters the main story is compelling and the artwork seemed to just get better. It is one of the more well known series and for good reason I can't say what there going to do with the anime but if it goes forward and follows the manga it will finish on a high.,6094,460,2019-04-13 21:35:39

i like this anime except when they are being stupid also how they pull away from one story then go back to it in like a few more episodes i waited 4 weeks to finally see ulqiorra fight ichigo,6112,466,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Just hitting my second year watching anime I only focused on shorter series to try keeping my interest at peek. its working but as I powered through a lot of series i found myself needing to watch something longer that is consider great. Bleach shown a lot of promise to me,6115,468,2019-04-13 21:35:39
There can be allot said about Bleach Ill start with the story. The story in Bleach is really good. The story never stays to long at one place and all ways moves forward but the problem with this is some great battle scences are short and not as enjoying. The story itself is very good though the story is all about a simple teenager named Ichigo Kurosaki. Everything in Ichigo's life was not quite normal he could speak to ghosts or spirits as they are called. 1 day he meets a strange girl by the name of Rukia Kuchiki a sould reaper. Soul reapers are dead spirits who help other spirits into the Soul society a place for spirits to go to as they pass on. Ichigo meets Rukia after being attacked by A Hollow. Hollows are bad spirits who have something holding them back on Earth. Rukia gets injured and trusts Ichigo to absorb her Soul reaper powers. Then the life of Ichigo will never be the same,6116,469,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,6117,470,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It has good points and bad points.  It resembles Fairy Tail a bit too much in a negative way in that the stories are often too similar especially with respect to enemies.  This is also true of the way the plots often center around the lead characters starting week at a new story arc getting stronger and stronger than most if not all enemies and then somehow getting weak again in time for the next arc.  For example how is Ichigo able to defeat Kenny Renji and tie Byaku but in a later story arc fight so weaklly and is saved by them against the same enemy he couldn't beat or against lesser enemies he struggled with?  I do not like it when it appears the creators or authors totally forget the story or any progress made especially to character development.  Even after he and his friends save others they are still not trusted well or treated like outsiders or used dangerously as scape goats or bait.  Most of the Soul Society Captains at least have some skill in non sword unarmed magic but Ichigo does not seem to have any such skil even by the 200th episode.  ,6119,471,2019-04-13 21:35:39

this anime was good for the most part but some of it wasnt needed. some arcs were used as filler but the story was great and so where the charters. the sound could have been a lil better but overall it was good.,6122,473,2019-04-13 21:35:39
(My opinion everyone) ,6124,474,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is really awesome because it has a really good story line to it but some times it goes off into some really long side storys and that gots anoing some times but other then that and really anoing fillers the sory line is still good. Along with a good introduction to all of the characters in it. It also has really good music to it and the speack of the characters is not to quiet and not to load. The Animation of the anime is great they do a good job of making the characters (in my opinon) almost life like.,6127,475,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is very good. On other websites this show is atleast the top 2 or 3 anime. This is one of the longest shows you will ever watch with over 300 episodes already. The plot is very good and so are the characters. The show is supernatural and its completely fiction except maybe for the feelings and the emotions of the chracters. This show is a bit confusing because halfway through the show a new season starts that is completely based on something else and after that season is over then the show will return to its original plot. So you might be confused on what you are watching at times. According to my source this show is not supposed to end for a very very long time. If you want to watch this show then I suggest go online and search up the story plot or summary of every episode/season because without it the episodes/season keep shifting and you are going to be very confused. That's what helped me when I first started watching this show. Overall this anime is quite entertatining and very a good show to watch. You may or may not like this anime because it depends on what type of anime you like to watch. This show falls under the categories of Shonue Supernatural Superpower Comedy and Action. If you like these type of anime then I suggest you watch this show. If you don't like these trype of anime then I suggest you watch another anime show.  But I am confident that most of you will enjoy this anime.,6131,478,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have not yet had the pleasure of having an anime so brilliantly executeds this one be tarnished so wholly by the filler thrown into it. This is theeason that I attempt to stay away from many anime of extraordinaryength.  Seasons One Two Three Six Seven and Eight minus a couplepisodes and a few more brief references to the episodes I've left out. his is Bleach. All the extra filler nonsense doesn't exist in my reviewecause I don't believe it a real portion of the anime itself. ,6137,480,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I love bleach. As far as I'm concerned it's one of the most amazing animes exsisting today. I love everything about it and I've proably watched it in total about 10 times. I only watch dubbed anime and everyone knows that in dubbed the lines are really dumbed down from the orginial japanese but even in english I loved it. I love how Ichigo's special and still a guy. There;s the perfect balance of character and the best part: THERE IS ALMOST IGNORANCE IN ANY OF THE CHARACTERS!!! Thats so rare in today's anime so it's good to hve when you can find it.,6149,482,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Bleach is one of the first anime i have ever watched. To me the story is really well written and the characters are epic and very likable. I love the soundtracks and the opening/endind songs. The art is amazing and the animation is done well. Bleach is my favorite anime.,6150,483,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,6151,484,2019-04-13 21:35:39
My Favorite anime of all time this anime is simply amazing the true work of a genius and this is what made me really see anime the way i do today.,6152,485,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime started really good. The animation wasn't so graet at the beginning but it soon got better and the music fit the situations perfectly. The story was promising and the characters were pretty good so far (well exept Kon he was annoying all the time). And then it took a turn to the worse. At some piont Orihime (crazy but nice girl) turned into annoying bit** that saidcried or screamed ''Kurosaki-kun!'' all the time. I won't talk about the filler arcs. I only watched the first one and stopped watching when the next one started.,6153,486,2019-04-13 21:35:39

bleach is based in multiple worlds eg the world of the livingsoul seciety(theres more to be said about this world but that would be spoiling hehehe)and the world of the hollows its best to read the rest after watching the animeanyway bleach has a huge plot but starts out a litlle slow so have some tolerence,6156,488,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is pretty good however and it has amazing characters. It does have a pretty good plot but not as good as some other anime,6162,489,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I think that this is one of my favorite animes that I have ever watched. I hate that they had to end it like that and wish that they continued it. The story lin to this anime if fairly good. I like that through most of the anime the main characters has a specific goal in mind and would do anything to reach that goal. I like most of the characters in this anime becasue they are awesome people and their characters are well devoloped through out the anime. The animation of this anime is pretty good compared to some other animes. I like the details that are put into some of the characters and the scenary of the anime. I like most of the songs in this anime because they are really good. Also most of the songs do not drown out the voices of the characters. Over all this is a fairly goo anime.,6163,490,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First I didn't want to watch thisbut then I decided to watch.And I'm glad I did.Bleach has interesting storybut there are jus tooo tooo much fillers.But If you will be able to watch them allyou will see also a great main plot.The world created in Bleach will catch you almost immediately and much more later because of big-revealing during the story.There are moment you will stop breathing and moments when you will laugh your heart out.,6165,492,2019-04-13 21:35:39
For a little while I loved this anime. When I first started watching it I thought it was the best thing ever. I got obsessed in the way I sometimes do with particularly good things.,6166,493,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This review is based on 15/366 episodes.  and I will continue to keep watching but these are my current thoughts and feelings about the anime.  Please don't just hate because i said something you don't agree with i hope you can understand my feelings as i'll read and accept yours.,6169,494,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I actually thought I would never see myself watching bleach because of the huge hype it has and because it was a long series. A year before while I was watching naruto my sis and I went to a library nearby and saw they had the bleach manga series. While my sis was reading 5 volumes I got bored of it after just reading volume 1 so you could say that I dropped it. But in the middle of November 2013 I just started watching for no apparent reason and I'm so glad I did. I've seen many of the characters like Hitsugaya Taichou Yoruichi Grimmjow Ukitake and many others so I was pretty excited to see how they would fight.There were some areas in the show that got me so pissed like the fillers (which are to be expected) and the change in the plot. In a detailed manner there are alot more areas that rubbed me the wrong way but I want to keep this review pretty small. (can you really call this small...?) If you want me to write a more detailed review about this anime I'd be more than happy to do so. Alright here is what I think about the following:,6171,495,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Honestly I'm done with bleach now. I have put up with all its fillers but really? after just getting off a several month long filler that has no place in the real story to then as a  Thank you viewers 10th anniversary  what do we get? We get a Bleeping dream sequence not even in teh current time frame of the anime. They even go to the point of recapping the first bleeping arc and mix it with Aladdin and the Arabian nights. To think I thought part 2 of batman must die comic was bad. -.-;,6172,496,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Excluding that everything is epic! Especilly sence the story isn't completly black and white. It has top quality battle scenes too.,6181,498,2019-04-13 21:35:39

With a strong cast of characters and amazing visuals Bleach starts off strong and keeps you interested though starts to loose appeal as the story chases rabbit holes creating filler as with many great anime that is produced faster than the manga can be written. ,6189,503,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a really good anime because it has a good story line to it. I love that it has almost one main goal for the main characters throught out the anime however sometimes I don't like that it can go off on to side storys for more then 20 episodes but some of those sides storys are good. I love the animation of the scenary in the anime it has very good details in most areas. I also think that most of the characters have really good animation to them along with good details. I love most of the music that is play during the opening and closing songs as well as during some of the fighting scences.  I also like most of the voices of the characters I think that the actors do a very good job. The characters of the anime are very good becasue most of them love to save people and also keep thier promises. I love that most of the characters are willing to do anything for their friends. Over all I think that this is a very good anime for most people to watch.,6194,504,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series started out good. The first Arc var really good and it wasn't that bad in the arcs after that either.  But the further out they came the more fillers they had and the more dragged out dialogs and fight scenes.  I stopped watching when they suddenly jumped out in the middle of an arc like nothing had happened two times in the same arc. Both times were for over 8 episodes. The series had a lot of potential but quickly started to die out. Naruto is pretty much the same but they managed to get up in Shippuuden and their fillers are mostly a lot better.,6195,505,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Very nice psychological piece! Original story about astral projecting lucid dreaming and spiritual world. Characters are really interesting positive either negative way. There are just few moments where reality becomes messy and you don't know nothing so you're getting a little bored but then it's explained well again. I would recommend it to everyone who likes to think and to see characters changing their minds as story goes on! :),6215,516,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Im not gonna lie. Im not a big fan of this anime but why did i waste my time watching 22 episodes and dying to know how it goes. Well its very simple its the very fact that Ghost Hound is a fiction based story that deals with scientific explanation psychological and paranormal phenomenons. For those who thoroughly researched  astral projection   near death experience  or out-of-body-experience  this is quite informative. Well just ignore some scenes that doesn't really make any sense.,6220,519,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ghost hound is a 22 episode psychological supernatural mystery horror anime. Less emphasis on the horror it has a significant amount of supernatural elements and actual science particularly psychology and neurology. It may be off-putting to younger viewers but only because of the sophisticated and slowish-paced plot. There’s a lot less actual action than other ‘horror’ anime. I’m still surprised at how educational this anime was capable of being not necessarily on purpose. For people who like mind-f**k anime and confusing anime (like myself) this might be right up their alley. I didn’t find much to be scared about which is a tad disappointing but the initially crazy plot was capable of making me doze off. That seems to be characteristic of such anime especially when watched very late at night. I’m kind of grateful for this anime helping me get to sleep though I had to rewatch the parts I was unconscious for. I can say with certainty that this is an interesting and unique anime that won’t appeal to all audiences but it one that is unique and serious enough that it's still suitable for people who don't like anime or who don't watch many.,6227,521,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is strongly recommended to those that like jokes that goes under the belt. IT isn't much of a story but you won't really need it since you will be busy laughing your ass off. And learn tons of new dirty slang in Japanese (if you're into that). The talking hamster - yes this is about a talking hamster - messes up everything by being to honest and seems in the end only be able to talk about sex related stuff. Which is in the end all we crave for too. You like it dirty and funny? Check out Ebichu!,6267,533,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have never found an anime that I have wanted to like more than this one I will assume you watched the original show and know all of the characters and the general storyline. The story ah yes the story it had so much potential and an interesting idea even though it is very similar to D Gray Man but it is way too childlike if they had made this a darker anime with a little bit rougher animation it would be amazing. Reverse could be the epitome of anti-Government organizations but it falls short of having any real goal the  All-Powerful Government  is relying on a 9 year old to do its field work where is its military? But skipping to the animation I have to judge it for how it is not how I think it should be overall the animation in my opinion is nice it flows and the characters seem to fit into the world they live in. The sound would be higher than 6 if it wasnt for the choice of opening songs these songs dont match the mood of the anime at all and are very annoying in my opinion cant wait to skip over them. The characters is what really gets me I love Niche as a character and her entire back story is really the only thing thats kept this anime afloat at times but Lag Seeing is such a cry baby that when it comes to the point in the episode where he just has to cry i find myself dreading it because it kills the serious mood that the show could have any other character who could redeem the show is ruined by having one flaw that the creators decided to use over and over again Gus is annoying in his stubborness and Dr Thunderland who I always thought could be a very cool character is ruined by him constantly talking about dissecting things.,6281,543,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I did a review for the first series and I will say at the very least this season is better than the first. They managed to take all the good things the first season had going for them- the art the setting the back story a few of the better characters and good music and voice actors and grow on that. They also managed to fix the two parts of the series that made it almost intolerable- Lag's non-stop crying (oh it's still there but nowhere near as much) and the fact that they made the series into an episodic letter of the week series instead of growing upon a very interesting story. Now seeing that they have great art a fairly strong story good voice talent and music and some interesting characters you would expect a better overall score but this is what this series fails to deliver- and sort of climax. There are probably a dozen different instances where I thought  man this is pretty cool  but felt absolutely nothing. Somehow this direct manages to take any and all exciments out of all the marque moments in this series which simply kills it. That aside I loved the story just not the person telling it. If you had seen the first season and managed to enjoy it this series is definitely worth picking up otherwise the first season is not worth wading through to simply watch this.,6286,544,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I was really looking forward to watching this anime; however after now seeing it I can only feel it was a waste of time.,6287,545,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The Good Witch of the West - Astraea Testament is sorta of your cliche Cinderella story except reversed. Commoner girl turns out to be a princess but give up her role to be with the one she loves her commoner childhood friend Roux. Firiel Dee is daughter of one of the royal queens and has the oppertunity to fight for the throne as soon as she is told. She even gets propsed to multiple times by a Queens canidate Adels' brother Eusis. But she throws it all away for her love Roux. Now this upset me a bit because I didn't see Roux as a love interest until the very end. He came as the true love interest to quickly and next thing I know Firiel is with Roux. If you put a realistic spin on this anime Roux would have been long in the dust and Firiel and Eusis would totally be together. Now that is my otp for this anime but I will not use my ship to attack others FirielxRoux ship but I will dislike your ship with pride. Just my opinion! ,6288,546,2019-04-13 21:35:39

love the music but the characters were poor. But then again it is a harem anime so it is hard to manage characters. The plot is very unique and provides a new genre into harem animes.,6303,551,2019-04-13 21:35:39
One thing you must do is stick with it. The first few episodes are boring lame and cliche. But that very quickly changes. And the animation is absolutely GORGEOUS. It has an element of fun but can also be very serious and leave you in fear for the characters. Overall a great anime and cant wait to watch season 2!,6305,552,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Mitsudomoes story is pretty much non-existant but that doesn't mean its a bad thing. In the first episode you are introduced to Satoshi Yabe who is he newest employee at Kamohashi Elementary School. He is very excited about his new but once he finds out that he is the homeroom teacher of class 6-3 his spirits are crushed. Class 6-3 is the class where the infamous Marui triplets. Between the 3 of them they are perverted violent and scary. I very hillarious combination when you pit all three of them in the same room.,6344,565,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you're anything like me there are times where you can't find the motivation to invest time in long complicated sagas but instead would much rather just sit back and enjoy a few quick laughs without the troublesome activity known as “thinking”.,6346,566,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Nobunaga the fool is one of those animes that draws you into it in the first couple episodes and then fails to deliver what it promises.  Many will disagree with me but if you want a good example of how it should be done then go watch Aquarion.  Its by the same producer.  The thing that hit me the hardest was the complete lask of focus.,6355,569,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story was great i enjoyed watching. 07-ghosts is quite a hand full with all the action taking place i really loved it but at times i cried when certain characters died which just added more enthusiasm in watching the anime. Overall its really fun to watch!!!!!,6375,575,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I started watching this anime  just because I was bored. I must say that the first episodes were great! They were heartwarming and a begining to a great story. But after the main characer enters the ''church '' and from thereon tries to become stronger to save mikage. it was interesting for a couple episodes  but it BECAME BORING! THE LACK OF CONTENT was ENOURMOUS! as a girl  only the nice charactes kept me in there. I REGRET it . It was booring to be honest. Episodes could pass without anything happening - at all! THAT KILLED ME! from the start  i thought the story was amazing! but after 10 episodes it all got down in a slope  and the end is a total letdown! belive me  this anime is not worth it. But it is an o.k  medium anime if you only look after something that can keep you entertained because you have notthing else to watch at that moment :),6377,576,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This was a very good anime.  The biggest negative about it however is the fact that it wasn't finished.  So I can not give it as high of marks as it probably deserves.  It is a fairly original story with lavish settings and a compelling plot.  It clearly draws inspiration from Christian traditions and the bible.  The Japanese studios often seem to love using a reverse set of antagonists or protagonists like making demons good guy characters or angels bad guy characters.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing.  There are bad guy angels in the bible too you might have heard of the most famous fallen angel.  Perhaps in the East demons are not seen as manifiestations of evil as mostly considered in Western cultures but maybe just manifestations of spirits.  Though some asepcts about what this church is in the anime are still left unanswered viewers are given plenty of background and detailed setting information.  I kind of myself doubt his ultimate destiny is as a priest and you may agree or disagree by the anime's end.  The biggest drawback as listed above is not only is the story basically unfinished but I even dare say it was left hanging on a cliffhanger plot point.  Viewers want to know what happens next but probably never will.  One of the priests is a bit of a perve and there is plenty of teasing and humor alluding to that however unlike most animes they do not over do it nor do they do it in atyical cliched fashion.  Though the story is mostly original there are a few tried and true cliche-ish plot points such at the opening when the main character faces his first crisis delimna from his own people.  And one of the main early characters is also a childhood friend (cliche) but again it is not done quite as cliche as usual.  It reaks quite closely of a hidden power factor though in kind of a layered way.  ,6379,577,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"This is an anime with amazing characters and a solid plot. There are a great deal of story-turns that keep you interested and it also deals with inner conflict as well as outer. As anime goes this one lives in a deeper dimension than most as said by a literary English graduate. My only gripe is the shadowy Eye of Mikhail that was never fully explained. I even did some research online and no one knows for sure what it is. I went through the show not really knowing exactly what it was or its purpose. I get the impression Taito doesn't understand it all that well either though. Let's hope if there is a second season we get some more details. ",6380,578,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When I watched this anime it wasn't one I thought I'd ever watch again though I have. Out of curiosity as to what happens next I read the manga and fell in love. This series only covers the first 20 or so chapters of the manga and you're left with a cliffhanger. It's also filled with unnecessary filler episodes near the beginning I assume so you feel something towards Teito's best friend Mikage. The anime cuts out a lot of Blackhawk moments to give you these fillers. Probably so you don't grow to like your antaginists. There are few people I know that actually dislike the blackhawks but I suppose in media you can't be confused who you're rooting against. ,6381,579,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story is solid all be it short and rather rushed near the end. The characters are good and kept me interested. I don't tend to like shows like this (kinda Shonnen -ai reverse harem like). They could have done much more with it it ends rather abruptly. I also don't like it when anime use CG in place of drawing. Otherwise a great show.,6383,580,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really liked this anime.  I wished it could have been a little longer but still found it very interesting.,6384,581,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It has been a year since I last watched this or maybe just a few months.,6385,582,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Let me just say I liked it . The main charater Teito having no memories about his past and was a former slave. He attends Barsburg Empire's military academy along with his friend Mikage. Then he finds out who killed his dad.......and tries to get revenge and ends up running away from the military. And that's sorta the plot. Well when you watch it you'll get it. I REALLY RECOMMEND IT. :),6390,583,2019-04-13 21:35:39
07 ghost tries to start off with a bang as the main characters life is turned upside down by a resurfacing memory. Then pretty much nothing happens for the next 7 episodes except cheesy dialogue lots of flashback and predictable character development. The rest of the series is mostly made up of random events strung together in some sort of a plot issues being resolved only to torture the protagonist again later on.,6392,584,2019-04-13 21:35:39
07-Ghost is a favorite anime of mine. It's about a young slave who was forced into the miltary. In the first episode he is framed for a murder he didn't commit and runs away only to be rescued by three super hot priests. However these priests aren't just ordinary priests they are exorcists! The general story line is about the main character learning to trust again and finding 'family' in these priests (as well as learning how to develop his magical abilities).,6397,585,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"I must say that this anime isn't recommended for people who are expecting action. Its more like a gay story condimented with some fun parts a bit of melodramathic fight scenes and a lot of drama and emotions. In my country that would be a Tv soap... but its gay so nobody would see it. ",6421,594,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really like this anime because it has a good story line to it. I like that is has a main goal that the main characters is trying to achive instead of going of onto other adeventers that have nothing to do with the characters goal. The animation of this anime is good considering the year that it was made in. Also the main characters have amazing details to them. The songs in this anime are really good they really relate back to the anime. Some of the characters have really good voices. I love most of the characters in the anime because they are really good people. Most of the main characters want to help others and not hurt them and I think that is awesome. So overall this anime is very good.,6422,595,2019-04-13 21:35:39

With its emotionally moving plot and compelling battle scenes it is to no surprise that this anime has hit a record high in my list. The plot was during the introduction interesting in the sense that I knew I had found something to at last enjoy my time watching.,6431,598,2019-04-13 21:35:39
" You gain strength courage and confidence by every experience by which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself. 'I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' ",6437,599,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Over all I really liked this anime. The animation itself was very good each character had their owm look and there was attention given to backround details that helped encourge the feel of another world. The characters were lovable (even if they were a little flat.) All supporting character's had one or two defining characteristics and didn't really change much throughout the show. Character development seemed to focus on the main character who worked to fingure how he wanted to live his life. The story was well paced but a little predicable. There wasn't anything in it that really shocked me. It revolves around both internal and exteral struggles that were pretty interesting. Some of the powers and driving forces of the plot were left unexplained which leaves me wondering (and hoping) if there will be a sequel. But what really led to me giving an eight out of ten wasn't really the plot characters or the animation it was the feel of this anime. It made me smile and cry and laugh sometimes at the same time. It tugged at my heartstrings more then an anime with a predicatble plot and unchanging characters should have. That's what mades it worth watching.,6438,600,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Going into 07-Ghost I was at first expecting something with a rather nice amount of action as well as a couple other different things in terms of plot.  Needless to really say that all my expectations were pretty much unfulfilled.  The story for 07-Ghost basically comes down a story about the young man named Teito Klein tries to unlock the secrets of his past as well as dealing with the every growing threat of Barsburg Empire and the God of Death Verloren.  It's a basic concept that has been done before and done better.  The fighting was clearly not the main point of the series.  With any battles for the most part occuring somewhere in the last couple of minutes in an episode and the enemy after giving Teito a little run a round is easily dispatched by one of the other people there.  Really this show runs a bit long with 25 episodes.  Especially considering that the entire show could have probably been condensed down to say 13 episodes and we would have gotten the same amount of plot progression.  The animation wasn't anything special it comes to be about average and while the fight scenes do look somewhat nice eventually things just seemed to blend together without anything really sticking out.  The sound for the most part didn't leave an impression.  The voice actors where average and didn't add anything to the series.  The soundtrack was forgetable and didn't add anything to the scenes and opening and ending weren't great but I guess all things considered fit the series fairly nicely so I guess that was a plus.  The characters were at several points just plain annoying and truth be told if male camaraderie isn't your thing then you're probably not going to enjoy this series very much.  In a show that is almost completely dominated by males it's a sad thing when some of the more interesting characters turned out to be the females.  Overall by the end of the series I was happy that it was over.  It really felt like it was twice as long as what it should have been.,6443,601,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I really like this anime because it has a good story line to it. I like that the main characters follow one main goal and see it through till the end and I also really like that this anime does not have very many filler episodes that do not add to the plot in some way. The animation of the characters and the scenary is good in this anime. I think that this anime has some good music to it but also that some of the songs sound like some older musical songs but not very many are like this. For the most part the characters are good. I think that some of them really need a new personality but that cannot happen because they were made that way and have to stay that way but I still want them to go. Overall this is a very good anime if you are into animes that invole magic in some.,6444,602,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Do you want to watch a series that features heroic heroes villainous villains and mind boggling fight scenes where every punch kick or special move is lovingly crafted and animated? Are you looking for a show that has a gripping storyline where every twist and turn of the plot will leave you on the edge of your seat? Do you crave excitement adventure and a hero who can kick more arse than the combined might of Kenshiro Goku Ichigo Naruto and whoever else you'd care to name?

First off I must confess that I am a huge fan of anything Starship Troopers. The Robert A. Heinlein book is sitting on my shelf and the 1997 film is my favorite film of all time. So while it is impossible for me to remove all of my bias I am going to try my best to write this review for someone who either isn't a hardcore fan or is new to the series.,6479,613,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This was another love hate anime. I loved it so much and then the ending the ending just leaves you going  AND THEN!?! . I loved it up until that. I could have done with a bit less romance but as it mostly focused on masihiro and gurren I accept the love interest they felt we needed to see. I enjoyed the storyline art sound/music and most of all the characters personalities. I also love that the main focus isnt romance even though it is included. I've watched it many times and each times I love it and still even though I know it is coming get annoyed with the ending. If you ignore the ending part it really is a good anime. If you don't like cliffhanger endings do not watch it will drive you insane.,6482,615,2019-04-13 21:35:39

this is one of thoses animes that i will start watching thinking that im going to hate it then start loving it and then by the last episode i will hate it and promise myself that i wont watch it any. (then i watch it years later thinking that its really much better than what my childlish eyes could see and saddly realise that really i was right that this anime is a strange combernation for crap and gold all mixed into one) ,6489,617,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Good show. The character Mokkun was awesome. The little thing was soute but then it had to ruin everything by turning into a shirtlessan. I just don't like how they have all these small stories that fillp the show until you get to the main problem near the end. You canell that the antagonist at the beginning of the show wasn't the mainillain so it felt difficult to get into that part. I know nothingajor was going to happen because they would save dramatic events forhe final bad guy. Still it was fun.,6491,618,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hetalia is an amazingly hilarious series for a show that only lasts for 5mins. But taking a show like that and sticking it into a hour long movie what could go wrong?

I think this is a movie you enjoy more in retrospect or upon watching multiple times. The beginning scene felt like a cheap trick to draw you in which pulled me out of the movie more than anything and the character of Shion didn’t help at all—at least not the first little while. I did figure there was some sort of reason she was the way she was and so the farther the movie progressed the more I grew to understand and like her. Which is why I think this movie would be better the second time around because then you understand her from the very beginning instead of finding her annoying.,6513,626,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i guess the movie was ok but i found it a bit boring at times and it kind of seemed to drag the ending on for a long time in my opinion but i guess it was ok i dont really regret watching it... but i just like all naruto movies! :D,6517,627,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It's Naruto so going in I wasn't exactly expecting much and for the most part I was right you get pretty much what you would expect from a Naruto movie.  Didn't really hate and it did have its good points but I didn't overly enjoy it either.  The story some soul of some powerful demon has been freed and wants to conquer the world and the only one who can stop the demon is some priestess in some other land and so it is up to Naruto and gang to ensure the priestess safety and get her to a temple so that she can once again seal the demon's soul.  It's a basic concept that has been done before in other series and in other Naruto as well.  So it wasn't anything new or refreshing but it was still interesting enough for me watch the entire hour and a half movie.  The animation was overall good.  It had a slightly higher production quality than that of the tv series so it was good but not really anything that special.  Though I will say that the CGI knights and the fire weren't all that great and seemed somewhat out of place.  As for the sound it was okay.  It blended well with the scenes but nothing ever really stood out.  Well for Naruto and the gang you either love them or hate them and as for the new characters they're all pretty standard.  A girl who acts spoiled but thats only to hide her real feelings and a standard bad guy who does nothing new.  Overall it's a pretty standard Naruto film that doesn't do anything new but works with what it has to make a semi-enjoyable experience.,6520,630,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Honestly this is one of my favourite naruto movies it was so funny and the ending fight was pretty cool also i liked hinatas and kibas personality changes the best xD it was an amazing movie and i reccomend people to watch it its just the best.. well in my opinion it is anyway. I liked it that much i watched more then once!!,6522,631,2019-04-13 21:35:39

 Actually i am not a big fan of the narutp movies but this one was great. It was really funny at some parts and so full of feelings. To see naruto having his parents  back  was amazing and of course also the fact that we could see all the akatsuki members again even if just for a short while. the story itself was a little unimaginative still great to watch and the ending really got me to be honest because i couldn't help but feeling so sad for him. ,6525,634,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Personally I loved it because of the fact that naruto gets to see his parents and have a family. what I wish for after seeing this movie is that naruto would get to stay with his family or something....i was really sad after seeing him have to leave and thought to myself why can't naruto have his family...and that is why I liked this one....although it's sad they didn't put a new movie rasengan in like in the other movies XD,6527,635,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is the sixth Naruto Shippuden movie.  In this movie we see Sakura parents and I think that kind of interesting because we never see her parents.  I wish we can see some of the Konoha Eleven parents in the future show or film because I want to see Rock Lee parents look like.  The plot is very interesting the plot is where Madara sent Naruto and Sakura to an alternative reality.  And at the alternative reality everything is different everyone they know are exact oppisite of each other my favorite is Hinata.  Also in this reality Naruto Parents are alive and Sakura parents is the one who saved the village for the Nine-Tails.  The fight animation in here was done pretty well the sound fell the same to me the character we see in this alternative reality was done very well.  So overall if you are a Naruto fan go watch it.,6528,636,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Amagi Brilliant Park is definitely not one of those animes where you just sit and wonder what the f*ck you just turned on. It has a decent and compelling story and I have to admit I cried at the end. There was enough of a story and enough character development to make you care about what was going on. I laughed numerous times over the random shenanigans that went on and over some of the characters reactions to different events.,6553,643,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story:,6554,644,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime was entertaining.  Now I dont watch a lot of anime in this catagory so taking my word for it might not be a good idea.  I just know that I wanted to watch it every week.  I thought this anime was very charming though.  ,6555,645,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is probably for younger viewers still it is quite interesting and the story is quite unusual. It starts off very well. At the beginning i had different expectations than how this anime actually developed in time. ,6557,646,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,6558,647,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Another masterpiece from Kyoto Animation (so far - knock on wood). The animation is always vivid the stories are entertaining and rich and the sound is... there. Nothing particularly spectacular with the music but it does the job. With the exception of the the return of Bonta-kun (Moffle) all the characters are fresh and new and including Bonta-kun 2.0 they are rich and well developed.,6560,648,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Yo Dawg heard you like Fanservice ruining a great story?,6566,649,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The way of main character overcoming harsh situations is entertaining. Plot is developing very slow but it made me teary for one time. If you don’t have anything major to watch and at the same time you want to laugh Amagi might be your choice.,6567,650,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Amagi Brilliant Park is a great anime for relaxing and enjoying a good story. The characters and their relationship show a great development during the story also the animation has a good draw with awesome soundtracks. Not to much action going on here but the way the story goes on really holds you watching it.,6568,651,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is one series that I'd been wanting to see ever since firstncountering it on some music videos during my college years. Once Iad the money to buy it... I found out the DVD collection was out ofrint. Fortunately a brief search around various online storesectified that problem and in a matter of weeks I finally had a copyn my hands. Don't bother to ask how long ago that was since I only gotround to finally watching over the course of the past week. Theuestion now is was it worth it?,6590,663,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Grenadier an action packed ecchi anime that actually has a story. And a very interesting story at that. It follows the adventures of a female Senshi (gunman) called Rushina and her samurai partner Yajiro. Due to the interesting plot and philosophies of the characters I really wanted to like and enjoy this anime. I would have done a drunk marathon for this going by the outward appearance alone but I was Ill that weekend. This anime unfortunately falls victim to the terrible tropes and typical ecchiness that plagues many anime. If you can look past these then enjoy. But otherwise I was frustrated at myself since I got bored during most of this otherwise interesting anime. I hate the ecchi genre and that is likely to affect the outcome of this review.,6609,669,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Based off the excellent Dreamcast game and Produced by Studio pierrot whose works include yu yu hakashu and Bleach .   This anime is Enjoyable for anyone whose played the game.   To be honest when I heard about it I was hyped but the fighting wasn't as exciting as I was hoping for .  I'll give it credit for decent characterization part of the fun is just seeing these characters come to live more so than in the game .   It has that old 90s animation charm and style really captures it .  The series is just interesting enough to not be boring and to provide sufficient motivation to keep watching but I wouldn't put it on a list of must see favorite anime .    The music is nothing bad but nothing amazing either honestly its at its peak with the techno rifts during narration .    Add in Sailor Moon levels of recycled animation and pretty good voice acting albeit judged by my far from high standards.    I think just about anyone could possibly get at least mild enjoyment out of watching it but I only highly recommend it to people that have played the game or for a parent looking for good anime for there children around the ages of 10 to 14 I say this because its anime with fighting and action that they could get a kick out of but clean enough to wear they can handle it .   I'm really happy the game was adapted into a series even if it isn't close to as entertaining as that source material .,6624,673,2019-04-13 21:35:39

To begin with I watched the English dubbed version of the 2004 Appleseed movie how this may affect my ratings I am not sure. I am not going to lie my anime tastes may not be as totally refined as many others but this is the first time I have come across such a highly rated piece of anime that I felt did not nearly live up to the hype.,6628,675,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This was a really good anime. It is a bit dark but it teachs a moral lesson about people who are trapped in their own darkness and only seek light. Some might not understand this but many do.,6653,685,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Nothing too exciting other than the fact that it might be new artwork for you to see. There is no story rather its just some artsists reditions and playing around that was put on the dvd as a bonus feature.,6654,686,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The Ein we all know and love does the sorts of things we'd expect him to do on vacation We get a cameo from Ed all set to a soundtrack that is pure Cowboy Bebop. This special's only shortcoming is that it's too well short.,6657,687,2019-04-13 21:35:39

When I started watching Infinite Stratos I wasn't sure what I was going to find.  Truth be told I only came accross the show as a result of one of those images you'd see shared around on Facebook by one of those anime like pages.  But what I saw was an amazing short story.  ,6695,710,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Oh Infinite Stratos- the acclaimed  most cliched series. Ever.  And I believe it does a fairly good job living up to your name. This is where many will ask  wait are cliches all that bad? If they are done so often doesn't that mean they have some merit?  Well that depends. In this case- no. With a few exceptions mainly stemming from the money pumped into this series there is little to say was done well in this show with one bright shining exception which will be latter addressed. Anyways on to the review proper. Note slight spoilers in the story section explaining why it is so horrible.,6702,712,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,6704,713,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I hated it for instance I thought it was just dumb and boring. I thought the NON action scenes were super duper boring. This anime I think is not worth the while watching. I really thought the scenes of the boy seeing the girl without clothes was really more stupid than comedic. I think this is the worst anime I have ever seen I don't reccomend it. Of course if you're still interested I won't stop you but this anime is dumb especially the parts when the girls just go nuts and want to change with the guy. I would rate it no stars at all if they did make it any worse.,6705,714,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime have a strong genre of Harem and the fan service is quite nice. The story is quite average but the characters are funny and loving. This anime is worth seeing for those who like Harem. The action is not bad but needs more details =P,6707,715,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Infinite Stratos is an Anime that is definitly worth watching.. Now I fully understand why IS has a Season 2 coming up... Well if you watched IS from the first episode you'll understand why Because? You can already feel the good and the warmth of the atmosphere of the anime itself...From the first episode to the last it's definitly worth watching or maybe worth watching it over and over again.. The Protagonist and Heroins really brighten up the story and they bring a strange aura of tense and excitment..,6709,716,2019-04-13 21:35:39

No need for a long review here IS is nothing more than a cookie cutter cut out harem/mecca anime. Nothing original or special about it in any way and the main protagonist really pissed me off just watching him. I mean really is anyone actually THAT clueless? The only real surprise for this anime was that I managed to watch 7 episodes without falling asleep. The sound and story were both boring and the characters simply had no life to them. The over all premise wasn't worth watching really either a truly boring anime.,6714,719,2019-04-13 21:35:39

One of the problems with the anime industry is the tendency to overuse stereotypes and themes and many of the studios in Japan continue to operate under the idea that the shows they create will generate a profit in some manner (regardless of the content) through DVD sales or merchandise. The sad fact is that many producers barely break even from one season to the next which then prompts arguments of piracy licensing pricing distribution costs etc all of which seems more than a little strange as while it may appear that the studios have some perfectly valid arguments they've neglected to talk about one thing - the anime they make.,6721,721,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really did like this anime. Story wasn't the best one available but few things really did surprice me. I give 8 for story 9 for animation sound and characters. Overall it is 9 and it deserves it. ,6746,733,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Let's start off by saying they had some really nice characters in this anime but left me in a sullen mood due to poor writing of the story.,6747,734,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Yes this series thrives off of cliches and it doesn't bring anything new to the table. But cliche isn't synonymous with unentertaining as IS proves.,6748,735,2019-04-13 21:35:39

So I just finished watching XXXHOLiC and I enojoyed it.,6761,740,2019-04-13 21:35:39
XXXHOLIC was a great Anime. It was the first to make me think about different aspects of life and death. The animation style of XXXHOLIC was one that I have never seen before( with long legs and arms) but it was cool. The one thing that kept me watching was the interest in the story. I wanted to know all about Kimihiro and why he was cursed. I also liked the comedy aspect. It is a very different Anime then I have ever seen before and thats why I like it so much. I suggest anyone who is unsure to try it out. Its a fun Anime that is dark at times abut has comedy to it also. See to believe! :),6762,741,2019-04-13 21:35:39
XXXholic strikes me as an anime that would make Granny Weatherwax proud. The story is largely character driven but the plot hangs on a subtle moral conversation between Yuuko and Watanuki. By exposing the Shop's clients to Watanuki the questions of personal responsibility v. self-reliance are explored and other more heavy handed moral questions are posed.,6768,742,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"﻿﻿",6777,748,2019-04-13 21:35:39
XXXHolic (pronounced as 'Holic') is 24 episodes of a positively peculiar comedy supernatural anime set in the typical Japanese high-school setting. A unique story lies in wait for those who decide to watch it episodic as it contains multiple self-contained story arcs. A slight bit of research and this anime is made by the same people who made other anime like Cardcaptor Sakura Chobits and Tsubasa Chronicle. Some of these are great and others not so much this anime features some cross-overs or the others feature this earlier anime as a crossover too. The short of it is that this an interesting anime and I'd recommend it to most people. Though at times it can get a bit creepy and occasionally it annoyed me.,6779,749,2019-04-13 21:35:39

XXXHOLIC is a great work and I loved it. It's about a seventeen year old boy who can see spirits. He tumbles into a wish-shop where he meets Yuuko. She promises to help him but with a price. The humor is excellent and no complaints about the lines.,6787,751,2019-04-13 21:35:39
XXXHolic is one of the first manga I ever read. I started it 5 years ago and I am proud to say that I'm still one impressed fan. It is one of the most notable from it's creator Clamp. It was with adversion that I started watching the animated version. And I say I am surprised.,6791,752,2019-04-13 21:35:39

When I watched the first episode I was concerned that the main character Wantanuki was going to kill any interest I had in the show.  Maru and Moro didn't help things either.  But Yuuko and the stories really had me.  I love the way Yuuko continues to antagonize Watanuki especially when she includes Domeki.  As time went on I even found Maru and Moro endearing.  I am really not looking forward to finishing the series.,6793,754,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As Digimon Frontier being the fourth instalment of the digimon franchise I would have to presonally place it as my favorite of the franchise. Alot of you are wondering why I choose this season over the first. And I shall explain why I do perfer it over the rest.,6795,756,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I watched this anime again because I grew up on this stuff it was more nostalgia than anything else. But nonetheless I would give it a 5 overall not to give it too much props but also not to throw it on the ground and step on it that would just be mean. As far as the story goes I mean yea heroes have a bunch of obstacles to overcome including each other and such i've heard some people complain about the lame story come on guys its for kids if its too intricate it will lose its simplicity. Characters are all right the digimon overlap and such the warriors were pretty cool. Being as how its a bit old the animation wont be too great or dynamic. Its alright for me it was all nostalgia.,6796,757,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I could just say  The manga is better  and let that be my review.,6800,760,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I loved this Anime! Each character had a distinct nature and style which means that the characters were actually worked on rather than just the main character having all the glory. I really liked how different episodes had a story for each character in building character development. The story was great. It shows how determined someone can be to reach thier goals and it made me realize that I shouldnt give up either---even if I dont have a promise to keep to a childhood friend. ;) Overall this was a great Anime. I was wanting more at the end of it. Another one to add to my favourites! Enjoy!,6802,761,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A very nice love story just the fact that they barely kissed and never said they loved eachother until the ova  Again .,6827,766,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A well written story and very enjoyable. I especially loved the mix of characters almost every girl can relate to one of the characters making it so fun to watch and laugh about saying 'thats me!'. I like how the world is so realistic aswell making it a tiny bit more believable (especially the fight for uni places!) I especially enjoy the special episodes like the dream when theyre all in a game and the festive ones (the scary one was scary too..creepy),6828,767,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I absolutely loved this anime.,6833,772,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To be honest I have never watched a romance type of anime like this before. I've always been into action/adventure animes only. I decided to randomly give it a try one day and I'm so glad I did.  Plastic Memories does a great job at bringing out emotions that you never thought would be brought out by an anime (ALL ABOARD THE FEELS TRAIN).  It also does a great job at making you laugh right after so it doesn't seem depressing.  You'll find yourself liking the main characters' personalities and traits as well as everyone they work with.  I would definitetly recommend this anime to anyone who has some time to kill.  ,6834,773,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,6835,774,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I don't review things the way others do. There's no set formula I don't like using numbers and each review is pretty much unique. They're also never designed with someone who hasn't watched the show in mind. My goal isn't to get people to watch or not watch a show it's to lay out my thoughts on the show. This is why each one is different because with each show that moves me enough to put words down strikes me with something new.,6838,777,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Introduction,6840,779,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I'm sorry to say but Plastic Memories fails to hit the mark. It's a romantic comedy with a sci-fi setting but - as already said - it fails to deliver in both cases. I'm not saying it's a terrible watch but honestly I don't feel like recommending it.,6841,780,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,6842,781,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Let's just say that I don't watch a lot of subbed anime and when I finished this I woke up the next morning with sore eyes because of how much I bawled my eyes out like a baby in the end. This anime has a very strong emotional storyline for anyone who's a romantic and soft hearted. I've never cried that hard for any other anime I've ever seen. I'd highly reccoment it for any of you romantics.,6843,782,2019-04-13 21:35:39

For a video review check out my Youtube channel. Link on my profile page.,6846,784,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When you watch the first episode of this anime you may be put off by the slow intro that feels so much like every other light hearted romance/office hijinks show you've seen but I'm telling you that you owe it to yourself to sit through the whole thing. Without spoiling it its really hard to convey the range of emotion that this anime is able to get across without seeming as though they made it just to pander to audiences. This show has weight and substance but isn't afraid to lighten the mood in-between just so that things don't seem so bleak.,6847,785,2019-04-13 21:35:39
After watching episodes so far I would say this already looks like quite the amazing anime. This is a summary and review so far after the summary RATING NOT FINAL,6848,786,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I found that shugo chara Party! is boring I liked shugo chara best but the second shugo chara doki was pritty good I did not like this one because the story line kind of flip flops and overall i did not like it too much,6851,789,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ok I honestly enjoyed Shugo Chara.  It had a pretty good story likeable characters and nice animation.  However Shugo Chara Party!! is honestly terrible.  ,6855,791,2019-04-13 21:35:39

...the first two seasons were better mainly because half of the episode was full of nonsense!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STUPID!,6857,793,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The continuation of the Shugo Chara! franchise is cute and happy but disappoints in its failure to continue much from unresolved problems from the earlier seasons. The new season has a special formatting too with two separate animes and special segments stuck in between. Really the season is very enjoyable and I loved the special segments especially the Open Heart Game and the Dance Lessons. That lessened my focus on the actual Shugo Chara! anime.,6861,794,2019-04-13 21:35:39
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,6862,795,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I loved the other Shugo Chara series' but this one totally ruined everything. Only like half the show is the actual anime while the rest is real people and crap little cartoons. It's horrible and can't even be considered a real anime now. I was hoping this series might be a continuation of fighting the bad guys and stuff but now it is sooo messed up. :P,6864,796,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So you come here... bored out of your mind and I know you have some kind of intention to watch this anime. Now there's nothing wrong in doing so but a little warning you need to have before you end up watching probably the worst anime of 2014. ,6867,797,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"Special A contains the atmosphere of the commonly scene high school life of a budding romance between a boy and girl.  As common as it may seem the strenuous life of Hikari enforces herself to become number one agaisnt her top rival since childhood Tadashi.  The anime's cliche scenes come across numerous times even though I've watched a few episodes.  During the beginning episodes of this anime it's obvious to predict the ending of the long awaited confession of Tadashi and Hikari's love.  Besides the unoriginal storyline and character development of the special class  S.A  I became fond of the cutsey randomness of many of the secondary characters.  Unfortunately I can't really commend any support for the animation of this anime.  The elongated characters remind me of clamps first works of tsubasa chronicles; the overly sized hands and feet. (-.-)  Overall I do believe this anime has some enjoyable factors of romantic comedy and high school life with a group of rich kids but I can't help but feel bored after the first few eps especially seeing too many of the same punchlines and the  sitting through the predictable endings of each episode.  ",6883,805,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,6884,806,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Konichuwa First of all i would like to say that this is my first review so please bear if i had to say anything stupid..... i loved watching 'SPECAIL A' as soon as i finished watching this it came under my all time favorites and i felt pretty sad that it ended so quickly..... story is good not the best but good. somewhat predictable but fun to watch..... characters are all pretty good especially kei hikari tadashi & akira..... can't stop laughing whenever tadashi comes......  animation is above average with few chibi comedy scenes (don't know how to say but i loved that parts)...... romance is thin which was a bit dissappointing..... expected kei-hikari tadshi-akira megumi-yahiro to kiss v_v but have to mention one thing each got a correct pair without any love triangles or harem (leaving yahiro-akira stories aside) for which i am so glad..... because in many anime i see either hero or heroine mixed up in love triangle leavin 1 or more poor guys heart broken which i really get upset...... anyhow it would be still better in sound & back ground musics. i am not saying music is bad but it would be still better...... comedy is superb tadashi-akira makes a good pair both in comedy & romance kei & hikari are fun to watch..... overall 'SPECIAL A' deserves a special place in my heart.....i would be happy if 2nd season is made. i am pretty sure many others feel the same way.....,6885,807,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Special A is one of my most favorite animes to watch over and over.  The characters are memorable and really touch your heart.  Like all shoujo animes I always wish the storyline could last longer and the episodes never end.. however it does.  You fall in love with Hikari because she is so thickheaded and intent on winning against Takshima while not realizing that hes completely in love with her (a favorite theme of mine for all shoujo animes =))) Moving on you fall in love with Takshima because he is so calm and collected but always worries about Hikari.,6891,810,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This story even though is one that is a one in a million high school stories was very enjoyable  the characters looked proportioned for a high school they were issues and love trhouble but not that many rivaly and thankfully didnt turn into a harem like many other before it. It was said that it resembles skip beat but in truth it doesn't this one had a happy ending but somethings were left unsaid even that it was fun watching it . There were several imberrasing moments that made me stop but other than that it had humor  romance  sadness  some idioticy and more than anything else it had a warm feeling of seeing people actually end up with some one special other than just all feeling confused over who loves who although she never did say the words only in her mind. I advice to watch this for some anime clensing .,6892,811,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,6893,812,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I first came across this anime after googling some good School Life anime's to watch.  Special A was on that list and I put it on mine to check it out.  Sadly I had to drop it.  I just couldn't get it.  It just didn't have that charm I found in a lot of other animes I've watched.  There was always that one thing about an anime I find that made me want to watch it.  I just couldn't find it here.  If anything I'm always over-praising an anime.  Everything just wasn't my taste.  However I am genuinely upset that I cannot will myself to finish it and I know I shouldn't.  There's so many good reviews that I'm kinda forced myself to try and find a reason to like it.  If I do I won't properly it as I should.  Hopefully I'll come back in the future and start fresh.,6895,813,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I rate this anime a 9.5 because honestly i love this anime. the only issue and i mean the only issue i have with this anime is that the ending isn't that great and it just made it seem a bit lame in the end i mean i guess we have our opinions but mine is that it wasnt a great ending it made me cry like once. It's one of my favorites though so i would highly recommend this ! thanks Have a happy time watching anime!!,6896,814,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"The density of the main female character (Hikari) to admit her feelings and realize the feelings others have for her (mainly Kei). Other than the occasional annoyance that presents this anime is good. All the other characters are great and I love the interaction and growth they all go through. It sails through seemingly smoothly other than the relationship drama until towards the end when the drama increases just a little. ",6901,817,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Overall - I give it a 5 out of 5 stars just for my sheer love of the series but in the case of breaking down the different areas it falls to 9/10.  My son has gotten me into anime after a long absence.  I grew up on Voltron and Speed Racer when there was only four available channels to watch TV if that is any context.  This particular show or series was a lot of fun.  it had highs and lows and added enough intrigue to keep you going from episode to episode.  I know I will watch this series again.   I should actually remove some more from the story ranking since it didn't come out with another season.  There was more than enough material to carry them through a second season without getting tired or deriviative.,6902,818,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Special A is one of my all time favorite animes. It is hilarious has a romance (that isn't a side story!) and I love the overall feel of it. It has been debated about how the makers went about doing the ending however it still has a perfectly good and happy conclusion. I have watched this anime twice despite my growing watch list and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you like unrealistic scenarios flowery mood backgrounds and many  LOL  moments in every episode Special A is for you. The best thing about this anime is that it never felt overblown. I never felt like the makers were trying too hard to make it funny like in many animes. It was naturally comedic and I like that. It also isn't so long that one gets bored and not so short that a story can't develop. ,6903,819,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Special A is a 24 episode high-school (slice-of-life style) comedy romance anime. Considering the story this is something that I’ve seen before in Kaichou wa Maid-Sama! which I found funny and enjoyed. It’s a sensible romance suitable for most but leans more towards shoujo. However ‘high-school’ and ‘romance’ are two thing that don’t do well together that’s just my opinion. Usually these types of anime don’t have a satisfying end.,6904,820,2019-04-13 21:35:39
**SPOILER** The ending was absolutely horrible and heartbreaking and the manga is much different. Same story line and base but over all very different. It was overall an amazing anime but the ending will surely break your heart.,6907,821,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I love the animations and all but the thing I really hate about it is the romance >_< Of course I do reccomend it but not as much as I did with Dream Eater Merry. Only that time when I reccomended it I really meant it :l. I hate the romance moments of this show it's all to cheesy. I really had a hard time figuring out what the main plot really was about or what the story was trying to lead up to. I just that every episode was just about a boy and a girl liking eachother basically. I'm done now I don't think those Special A fans (I am kinda one too) appreciate me scolding Special A like that XD I do like that fact that S.A. does have some comedy in it. That's the reason why I kept watching it I also liked the animation.,6909,822,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Initial D Third Stage,6927,828,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Even though this is a movie its a perfect sequel to the existing 2 stages. It has a large focus on Takumi and Mogi's relationship and fills those little holes that you have in the heart from whats going on. I won't go into too much detail with this one being as its a movie but what I can say is that its still as solid as ever in the categories given. The story is perfect in its move forward and patching of gaps in the first two stages the animation in both the 2D and 3D is consistently good the sound is still top notch and the characters are still brilliant. It keeps the maturity levels high with no fan service still meaning this is a great sequel. It's a must watch for those who have seen the first 2 stages!,6930,829,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I happened on this by accident and watched it thinking it may be somthing else. It is a decent anime that is animated fairly well. The music and animation could be your only reasons to watch this. The story its self while consistant doesn't really expand too much and there isn't really a story arc to draw the episodes together strongly. Most of the secondary characters you see which just seem out of place or just thrown in to fill a hole or need.,6947,838,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Not spoiling anything.,6948,839,2019-04-13 21:35:39
“Death Parade” at the time of its release was one of my most anticipated shows of the season.  Material based on a single episode entitled “Death Billiards” the full 12 episode show follows “Arbiters”. These are beings of the afterlife whose sole purpose is to judge humans who have passed on and determine whether they should be sent to Heaven or Hell (later clarified to be closer to Reincarnation and the Void.)  On the surface this is a fascinating concept. Furthermore having watched Death Billiards first I already knew that I liked the style of the animation the character designs the general episode set up etc.  So I assumed that this show was an automatic win.  What I did not anticipate was the expansion of this one episode concept getting so bogged down with explanations poorly formed theoretical arguments and poor characterization that I genuinely had a hard time finishing it.,6950,840,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As I sit here eating a bowl of Cookie Crisp ceral with a can of Irn Bru by my side at half past 8 in the morning I feel the urge to review something. So what better way to return to reviewing with a little title from the most recently completed Winter 2015 season.,6986,860,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If you watch closely and listen to what is being said you can see here the beggininnings of Ghost In The Shell.  Secret government agency concerned with internal security.  Agents being cyberized.  Government departments at war with one another due to internal corruption.  Sound familiar?  I watch a lot of the old anime and you can find a lot of story origins.  Watch Gundress and see what I mean.  Angel Cop is violent.  But we aren't all kids here.  The  animation is old but well done for the time.  I gave sound a low score because the version I watched had an out of sync sound track.  All in all an enjoyable title but not maybe something you would invite all of your pals to watch.,6987,861,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I found this season to be even better than the first season and the first season twas beautiful. This season focuses on Issei finding out about some excalibur swords and the backstories of Kiba and Akeno (although to a lesser extent). It also introduces Gasper one of the best characters ever Xenovia. It was truly amazing to see how much the characters have going for them it adds to their charisma and the humor is absolutely spectacular. Issei might as well be the joke of the series because his english dub voice is magnificent like the voice actor is genuinely happy with voicing him.,7021,873,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I came across this while being bored and having not many nice anime's too watch.  So I hit YouTube to look for some and came across a  Top 10 Comedy Anime  video.  While this show wasn't on the list I saw a comment that mentioned it.  The replies and were nothing but high praise for the show and that was enough for me to give it a try.,7028,879,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'm usually not a laugher but this anime was so much fun! Even if there were some no needed short stories most of this anime was really good. I'll watch it twice for sure !,7030,881,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Possibly the funniest anime I've ever seen. Maybe it was how natural it seemed or just how similar some of the rediculous scenarios that were on the show were to the real experiences I've had in high school maybe a mixture of both. Either way its unique comedic style made it a very enjoyable anime to watch and its ending was beautifully done. ,7031,882,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I wouldn't call myself a dry person yet I find it difficult to be engaged enough in a story to let it influence me. You know how you tend to laugh more at a show when others are with you? Something about it makes it all fun more worthwhile.,7032,883,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well this anime was a pretty funny to watch and I felt liked id seen some of the guys do some of things these guys did. I got kind of bored at parts tho honestly it could just be me since its not the usual genre I watch.  it had a good ending at least for it being random scenes within each ep. Check it out if you like~,7044,885,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I watched a lot of comedy anime but I have never laughed at one as much as I did when watching this. My stomach hurt from laughing so much literally. I think people around me thought I was on something! Seriously if you want to laugh this is a must watch.,7045,886,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In my opinion THE funniest anime EVERXD its nice to find an anime like this with a little romancea lot of comedy and NO drama,7048,887,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: We start off from the end of season 1 and we're immediately introduced to money issues of the costs to keep running Akihabara the way it is so Shiroe jouneys off to the north to attempt a raid in Abyssal Shaft after failing to negotiate with the Kunie clan. A little later on another problem appears in Akihabara with a murderer that Akatsuki has to deal with. This is where Log Horizon begins to get more personal and is the beginning of it's downfall. The subplot between Demiqas and Shiroe isn't the least bit interesting since the conclusion came down to them not liking each other. The addition of another mechanic overskills been more explained was welcomed and needed in order for Akatsuki to defeat the murderer. Shiroe finishing the raid in the Gold of the Kunie Arc left much to be desired since I came to the realization that the plot was getting stale when it didn't do much for the overarching world. The subject of death is brought up again around the concerns of memory loss but it's never explored deeply about how or why that came to be so we're left with no closure in that topic. The next Arc focused around the noob squad's next adventure which further dragged the already bloated scenario. This is arguably the low point of the series and to make things worse despite being canon to the original source it felt like filler that had nothing to do with the story since it wasn't related to Shiroe's end goal. Compared to the first season Log Horizon takes a large nosedive in terms of quality when it comes to the plot. The author's lack of oversight in the goal of this series becomes apparent early on and disappointedly enough it doesn't pick up until the near end of this season. ,7054,890,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Intrigue appears to be the name of the game for season 2.  Much of the who ha deals with underhanded tactics and dealings with various enemies mostly hidden in shadow or in plain sight but well camoflaged.  In some ways yet the raids and enemies are tougher as they are not fighting the same type of enemy therefore the scale is a bit different.  At points it becomes a bit cloudy as to who the enemies are.  You do start to wander about what is happening in the real world.  If their bodies do not match their real world ones will those bodies change? Or if they go back will they have years of being clumsy until they get reacustomed to them?  It is said that you change to match your avatar and yet sometimes I wonder how personalities can be so affected or were some people that quirky before playing the game?  That part is unclear.  Another thing that is hard to comprehend is why are the main characters still so low leveled compared to enemies despite the fact that the main characters frequently fight super hard enemies and very high end raids?  It does not make much sense to me.  At the same time if laws within game can be changed does that mean the cocky sorceror who is a native and yet became a player able to then eventually wake up in the real world as if created from nothing?  I do not know if this is possible yet based on how things are going questions like these come to mind.  I just hope we eventually get some answers.,7058,891,2019-04-13 21:35:39

First of all season 1 was really amazing. The series easily caught people's attention through the creative and realistic gaming world of Elder Tale. If we are to compare season 1 with season 2 it is fair to say that season 2 is lacking in terms of excitement whilst season 1 immediately thrilled us right from its early episodes and maintained it well until the end. Despite its failure to surpass season 1 let us not forget the fact that the series is still ongoing. ,7071,896,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I want to be short here. They did have some good ideas in this season but it is 80% filler. ,7081,898,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Log Horizon 2 did have it's moments and was enjoyable. This season however gets weaker as it progresses past the half way point before the last few episodes which it up it's game once again.,7082,899,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Don't watch this season if you liked the first one it is not worth it. Studio Deen just can't seem to figure out how to adapt light novels or even write up the filler specials for them. The first season of Log Horizon did a great job introducing the virtual/real world conjunction and how that affected the characters and societies that naturally bloomed inside the world. The second season is.... not sure how to describe it. Boring? Meaningless? Character development is frozen but people pretend things start happening?,7083,900,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime is based off of a Korean drama by the same name. The story line to me was done so beautifully. There was all sorts of emotions flowings for all the characters. Teh way the plot twisted and turned along with the characters emotions really will get you hooked and not wanting to stop watching it. This anime is moving and makes one wish that love like this truly existed or was more common. The animation was beautiful and the story progress a steady pace that wasn't too fast slow or confusing. I'd definitely recommend this anime.,7088,901,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Tobira o Akete is about a college student nicknamed  Neko  that has pyschic and telekinetic powers. She is joined by two friends one that can teleport and the other that can turn into a lion. Their powers are heightened when the moon is full. One day they are transported to a fantasy world. Neko is recognized as Neryulla by the people there. Neryulla was a Princess of legend that fought off an invading army many years in the past. This Princess had magical powers. Because in this world the moon is always full Neko and her friends have greater powers and this just makes the people believe more that she is the legendary Princess. The story has several characters. The main ones get some development which is good for a just a 70 minute movie. The story is typical in many ways but it adds nice things as well. Neko is finding herself on this journy as a young girl. She takes the role of the Princess and fights back the evil military that has ruled the land for many years. There is a twist. But I won't spoil it.,7174,930,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have to agree that the only redeeming feature of Yumeria is that it makes for good riffing material. The main thing is that this dude gets a harem of superpowered women that fight enemies that invade the dreamworld.  About the only memorable scene in this one is where Tomokazu is in class and visualizes himself being the uke to his domineering teacher. I also agree that the character Mone was quite annoying as was everyone else calling Tomokazu a pervert. Holes in the plot also drag this one down: they never explain why the faydooms were invading in the first place. ,7176,932,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This OVA was the worst Rurouni Kenshin ova ever created! The fight scenes were fastboring and lifeless. I never imagined seeing the kyoto arc of Rurouni Kenshin shit on like this. My favorite battle between Aoshi and Kenshin lasted literally 5 secondsShisio's head split apart..and omg j...just never watch this abortion of an ova. The only good thing was the animation/music. Everything else in this ova was complete shit. Oh and if someone stumbled upon this ova before the actual Rurouni Kenshin anime or manga series then they would be completely lost. ,7179,935,2019-04-13 21:35:39

this anime had so much potential. the developers went through so much trouble to list out every ones powers and abilities (which got me super excited) only for show. all the way towards the end you don't really see any of that being used. theres hardly any action and if there were  fight scenes  it would be a quick pow and sparks and punching and its all over.NOONE USES THEIR ABILITIES. or you don't actually see it being used. the story is really rushed and there were no romantic developments. it was just 2 guys who actually liked the main character. in the end she picks none of them as she watches them both fighting (mostly just hear back ground music). i feel no connection to this anime. and all the other guys were hardly secondary characters. they were basically the back ground. espcially towards the end you see theme fighting for felicita they got knockd out one by one without actual fight. maybe the developers were rushed or whatsoever but this anime lacked a lot,7211,939,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Senran Kagura is like one of those bait and switches you're promised a cake you get broccoli you're promised money you get bills and in this case you're promised badassery but you get crap. Senran Kagura has to be one of the lamest anime I've ever seen. Oh and despite being an Ecchi there is no nudity well there is (with convieniently placed hair to block out the good bits) It follows a girl named Asuka. Her character is likable enough if not bland. Sadly her sweet charm is wasted around other characters who will either bore or annoy you. They just feel so bland and there's even an arc where they are given villains who are exactly like them and no matter where they are the villains are able to pinpoint their location. The whole anime is just one big training episode and the plot is non-existant. It's not even laughably bad it's just bad. Even Fractale was at one point actually good (before that one spiraled off into complete nonsense as well).,7244,945,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Anime about baseball?? Who would've guessed I would ever watch it. But I did. And I'm happy I did.,7279,964,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is absolutely a pleasure to watch. I wouldn't say this is a baseball anime. This is an anime about a boy who plays baseball and his story as he is growing up. Baseball in this anime is simply a medium to tell Goro's story as he trains hard learn new things and make friends. You definitely won't learn much about baseball in this anime because it doesn't talk about the strategies used in the sports at all. Like I said this anime uses baseball as a medium to tell Goro's story. If you want a baseball anime that also talks about the strategy may I recommend Ookiku Furikabutte? ,7285,965,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Its an ok anime because its short. I wouldnt be able to put up with it if it was any longer. The problem to me is that everyone is keeping secrets... which helps it drag the story out but... Its agrivating...,7294,967,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As an anime this series leaves alot to be desired.  It starts out murky confusing muddled and yet as the story progresses the poor viewer is not provided with any significant answers.  I was about as puzzled by the end as I was at the beginning.  At first the show has promise unfortunately that promise is never delivered.  While it is ok to foreshadow and lead your intended audience into some sort of mystery it is not ok to keep them hanging indefinitely or to provide foreshadowing of events or circumstances that never unveil themselves in the story.  I got the impression that a driving in the dark without headlights on is more in depth and revealing than this entire series.  We see a as usual in most anime high school student thrown into the paranormal but oddly enough his mind seems befuddled.  Throughout the entire series until near or at the end he frequently stares in to empty space or appears to blank out.  When inquired about himself by friends or family he all to often provides lackluster responses if any as if he has no idea what is going on in life at all.  It is perhaps ironic that the series follows this bewildered mind in tone and itself is also as foggy as the absent minded professor's head.  There are hints about what is going on or what has happened but they are soo fuzzy I never really got a grasp of what exactly the story was truly about and the ending was no more enlightenging than the very first episode.  ,7295,968,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Don't get me wrong. I love Tsukihime. It's just that I love the VN and not so much the anime. Tsukihime as a VN was deep and had several layers of story that all combined to make one of my favorite pieces of art. The problem with this anime is that it only scratches the surface. It's understandable. I'm sure it would be difficult to capture every aspect of the games many story arcs and throw them into a few episodes of a linear anime but it doesn't change the fact that this anime does not do the real story justice. As far as animes go it's decent and watchable. It will just never compare to it's VN counterpart. ,7305,972,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I went into it without knowing a thing other thenhe massive similarities to it with Kara no Kyoukai and I was simply stunned atow great a story it was.

This is a straight up DO NOT WATCH. This amazing story was butchered when it was turned into an anime. It's childish has bad sound effects bad dialogue and bad animation. It's like they wanted to take the rather graphic story and givie it to 3 year olds.

Considering how I rate this on my list this may look a bit odd - how the scores are not much more than average. The reason for that is simple: based on how I viewed the books I had grown up with I saw a perfect medium with which to visualize the words I had so often read at home. Because I know others who have read the series some parts didn't seem as out of place as they might've if I had only seen the anime. When I recommended this to some they found certain aspects to be quite detrimental (such as Thaegan's song the words on the slate that were sometimes characters or english etc.) that I didn't think about because I had already recognized they were a part of that world and the  nostalgia immunity  kicked in. At the same time that was what made the book series what it was and to change those at all would have basically made it another series entirely (yes even the place called  The Dark ).,7363,987,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Deltora Quest is normally considered a poor anime that is just a typical adventure series about travelling around a world that is now ruled by a great evil. To save the world Lief Barda and Jasmine must collect gems for the mystical Belt of Deltora. This sounds cliche and most of the anime is cliche. However I found this anime to be more enjoyable than most people think. It's best to watch with other people like your family and a group of friends. I watched this with my sister and for probably the first 15 episodes all we did was make fun of pretty much everything that happened. However after a while we began to become seriously excited about watching the next episode and more interested in the story as they got closer to collecting all of the gems. We left off when they collected all of the gems as the channel that played Deltora Quest for us stopped showing new episodes which was very disappointing. Despite having made fun of the series at the beginning we came close to it. If you give this series a chance then you might find that you'll come to enjoy it too.,7364,988,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Right off the bat I realized that this looked a lot like the Girl Who Leapt Through Time. I quickly realized that this was much better IMO. This movie was more action while the other was more slice of life. It definitely made this new movie more exciting to watch.

As far as family entertainment goes anime is rarely high on the agenda especially given the numerous offerings from Disney Dreamworks and other such movie studios. Generally their features appeal to children and adults alike and in order to compete with them Japanese animation studios have had to shake off their habitual approach and focus on making films that are more accessible to Western markets. The undisputed king of this is Miyazaki Hayao however there have been several challengers to his throne the latest being Hosoda Mamoru.,7411,999,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Shigurui is vile disgusting trash - the gratuitous use of violence really distracts from the characters and what little story the anime is trying to tell - people have told me that it's trying to resemble the brutal Samurai era of fedual Japan in that case it works there's misogyny there's harakiri there's rape murder everything; but there's no interesting story here as we follow these two incredibly unlikeable characters. I can't route for these guys I can't feel any sympathy for them escpically when they do these horrible things. Violence has to have a narrative purpose instead of just being there for shock value and that's all Shigurui is. A Great soundtrack and an unusal art style can't save it though.,7466,24,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have to say aside from the nice looking animation this may be one of the worst anime I've ever had the dissatisfaction of forcing myself to finish (because Im an ocd  otaku  and have to finish an anime once Ive started it). The story is pretty random and all over the place the character development is nonexistant and the pace is unbearably slow. Save yourself and go watch Basilisk.

"I can't help but compare this to the show me having watched that first (which I rated 5 stars btw) and this doesn't measure up not even close. What this is is the taking of the first three episodes and then adding a big major battle at the end. The movie packed in as many characters as possible with little development. For me it was pointless and I wish I would have spent my time starting season 2 and bypassing the whole experience. It contains meaningless scenes and characters that amount to nothing in this self-contained movie. What made the show was the progressive and humoruous relationship between Yuji and Shana along with her slow yet steady understanding of human emotion. Instead this lacked both and Shana simply remained confused and distant until maybe a hint at the end.  ",7485,34,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok after watching the first season this movie really sucked in comparision. First off there was no reason for the girl that likes Yuji to be in it since she doesn't do anything. It was ok to have in it during the part at school but when they show her at her house it is pointless. It was kind of funny how the girl with the big back pack was on the TV all the time but that was also pointless. There was no development of Shana's personality at all. She had no reason to care for Yuji and when she got hurt I didn't really care that much. In the actual show I cared a lot. All in all this movie was sort of lame and didn't feel the same. There were cool fight sceens and the animation was awsome but the story was bad. The only good part of the story was the part that was exactly the same as the show which was the very begining of the movie.,7488,35,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay so if you are expecting season 2 to have lots of development in terms of the love story then you may be dissapointed. As in season 1 the devlopment of Nanami and Tomoe's relationship makes some progress but not much. Tomoe still takes forever to admit his true feelings but at least he finally does. The problem with Kamisama Hajimemashita it that both seasons are way too short. You feel like you only get to spend one or two episodes with a new character because there are only 12-13 episodes in both seasons. I do not feel like the shortness of the series allows you to feel satisfied. Hopefully there will be a season 3 because season two ends on a cliff hanger even more so than the first season.,7497,40,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I absolutely loved Kamisama Hajimemashita season 1 and season 2. I normally go straight for plain serious drama action and romance without any question but how they put the comedy into here and still made it some what logical was pure genious! I loved this anime so much that I mark everything 100! There was not a character I hated! They all played the'r roles wonderfully and even the small charaters such as the huge spider that brought that green aura was a wonderful peice to the show! I could and will watch this anime 100 more times! Maybe even more than that! XD Although the ending didn't end comepletely how I wanted it to it was still very well done and I wouldn't change it any other way... Unless you can add a couple more minutes where Tomoe and Natsume can have some time to theirselves and they end up kissing each other when she remembers his purposal! AT LEAT HAVE THE DECENTSY TO GIVE US A GOD DAMN THIRD SEASON! I mean... I loved it! :D,7501,43,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This show is definitely one of the more...interesting things I've seen in a while.  The plot scores some massive points for being both original and interesting.  This show exudes masculinity so if you are not a shonen fan you may not be as wowed as I was.  Without giving away too much of the plot let's just say that fans of cooking shows that are also fans of larger than life battles will love this.  The animation is clean and crisp and definitely helps in bringing the characters to life.  The soundtrack is nothing special but the voices fit the characters perfectly and really help flesh them out.  I was personally amazed at just how attached I became to these characters in the short amount of time this show lasted.  I found the two main characters endearing and there is something about the way they are presented that makes me overlook the fact we have seen characters with similar personalities before.  If one thing I'd say the fatal flaw of this short is that it simply leaves a taste of brilliance in your mouth and leaves you yearning for more. ,7511,47,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Baka to Test; it may be stupid but it's at the point of being stupidly fun without moving into annoying and this OVA is no different. As the synopsis states it's an adaptation of the Festival arc in the manga. It's recommended that one watches the first season before watching the OVA as to not miss out on some of the references to events seen in the first season. You don't have to as this is simple minded fun and can be enjoyed without knowing what happened before (And that the first season was pretty episodic at times). But it's recommended nonetheless as it would be a shame to miss out on the fun of season one.,7580,76,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The fox god is cute fun and funny.  She is a powerful entity but is also naive and like a child when she is exploring the community and all the new things she did not get to notice while she was confined.  Yet despite her bitter past and sub par previous treatment she is bright cheery and optimistic.  The sentinal though feels a bit shallow as if her character was never fully completed.  She is almost like a savant.  She is really good at one thing and a complete failure at everything else.  But she is so bad and incompetent that it takes her the entire series just to learn a few new things most people experience as common sense.  Common sense wise she has even less than the fox aka Kuu or Kugen.  She is a typical dumb bimbo type character but with magical power.  If she were just a hair more intelligent capable of learning from her past and mistakes just a hair better and actually had some measure of common sense she would be a charming if not dimwitted character but as she is she  is more of a nuisence than a boon to anyone around her.  ,7610,90,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wagaya no Oinari-Sama is a 24 episode comedy fantasy anime set in modern day Japan featuring light themes of romance and (ugh) ecchi/harem. Before reading this review I’d like to disclose my personal bias against ecchi harem pointless fan-service and shoehorned romance that doesn’t go anywhere (it happens so much that I’m now wary whenever I see that an anime has a hint of romance in it).,7616,93,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I won't get into a long diatribe about this anime But I will tell you it was good. Good not great.,7654,108,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A girl extorts a guy to act as his boyfriend. Nothing final or decisive happens at any point. The characters are immoral and unrelateable and the MC is just the generic anime lead. The only upside to this anime I found was Chiwas and Eitas (already having trouble remembering his name) relationship and its history. The animation had a distinct touch to it and was pleasing to the eye consistently. Overall the show was really hard to get through I almost dropped it multiple times and I had to fight the urge to jump forwards over the stupid bits pretty much all the time. Don't waste your time on this.,7655,109,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Originally I wasn't going to do a review but I want others to share in my pain and had I read the tags before watching I may have given this one a pass purely for the harem. These are seldom if at all done to any standard I would consider average - most are just mind-numbingly awful that make me want to fly to Japan just to punch the writers in the testicles. It came as no surprise that Oreshura didn't disappoint with regards to being absolute shite.,7662,112,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: It's very much your typical romance harem anime and the plot isn't that interesting enough. There's really no conflict and climax throughout the anime. It was super easy to predict how the anime would end.,7664,113,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To me it felt like just another 20 minutes of Steins;Gate 2011 TV series. Which is a good thing if you liked the series. Its not an empty recap it is a new episode without the tension of the main storyline (not enough time to build one here). So it's mainly just the usual cute characters and their relations.,7666,114,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I was in a complete rut as to what to watch next. This was something that was recommended by someone after I had posted multiple recommendation threads on multiple websites... and wow. I had completely given up on this genre in the past (shoujo). But this shoujo is unlike any other you have seen before... or at least it was for me! The characters plot animation were all completely fresh and way more intense-- practially bordering a non-shoujo anime or whatever you'd call it. I am completely surprised and definitely give it five stars.,7705,126,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Madoka Magica is pure perfect anime; it's dark thilling gripping interesting suprising emotional funny memorable like-able characters an unexspected villian who isn't really a villian but it is a villian brilliant soundtrack - J-pop to horror esc music and vivid variety in the animation.

Despite the fact that the show primiered in January it has already amassed a huge cult following over 200 fanfics on Fanfiction.net and been picked up by Aniplex to be released in North America although whether or not there will be a dub is still uncertain.,7718,133,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sometimes having a lot of hype can be good. In this case I didnt want to watch this anime for obvious reasons(its just too girly and childish). But its pretty famous got a lot of awards so there has to be something to it. I watched 3 episodes at forst and the verdict was: altough the basic plot is the wet-dream of a pedophile they didnt make any mistakes at all. The characters were OK the dialo was smart. Basically if you dont include the ridiculously childish character animation its a mature anime with fantastc background  animation and a pretty serious plot.,7721,135,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I generally avoid magical girls. way to much char girly frill. just not my thing but this was differant. it had a rather dark tone and an interesting twist in the end. the story was good and engadged me keeping me going. it wasn't what I was expecting when I started watching and realized what it was. I liked the fact taht magical girls in this universe weren't some mirical but some screwed up idea of a fair deal. and how it ended well it was a happy ending but not quite the I saved the day and all is good but just changing the trade just enough to keep the old and soften the bad that came with it. not my usual fair but this was worth my time watching. thanks justDubs I wouldn't ahve found this on my own. ,7730,140,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Magical girls cute adorable moe girls with magical powers. Focus of anime aimed at young girls. Typical magical girl anime include Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura. One day Gen Urobuchi thought let's take this lighthearted genre and make it dark as all hell. Was it a good idea? Well that's what I'm here to review! Ladies gentleman and evil kittens I'm Ayanamisenpai and welcome to a review of Madoka Magica. ,7744,143,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It's long been the case that specific genres of anime are often intensely focused on certain genders and age groups and this fact is most apparent when one considers the mahou shoujo category. From Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew to Pretty Cure and Shugo Chara the titles on offer that feature the exploits of one or more magical girls all seem to have several things in common - cute characters cute outfits cute sidekicks  cute  costume changes twinkly/sparkly/sugary atmospheres and a penchant for appealing to the sensibilities of 7 to 14 year old girls.,7745,144,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Coming into this series you just see another lame Magical Girl series... but what caught my eyes was the studio that was making this series- Shaft. Seeing this I decided to give this series a try... and I am very glad that I did. It took all of my preconceived notions about what a magical girl series is and destroyed them. That being said if you are to only watch one Magical Girl series ever this is the one you should try.,7751,147,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,7768,152,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Animes that defy initially appearance are rare but seem to be more common these days some become better than they look while others become worse.  Magi Madoka is one such I am glad I gave a go because it was much better than its ‘magic girl’ appearance.  This is an anime that the less you know going in the better other than perhaps it is an adult ‘magic girl’/Sailor Moon.,7769,153,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I've read many people praising this show for its adult perspective on the magical girls genre. But I just couldn't get into it. Didn't like the pacing of the episodes too much talking (and walking) - not enough showing and while the characters asked adult-like questions (although never asked for Kuybey to explain the contract in full) they were cute magical girls so I couldn't suspend my disbelief that they would ask such questions. It was like the concepts were 3D but the characters were still 2D (no pun intended). I also never really cared for any of the characters which I think is necessary to enjoy this show. How they show Madoka's family life in the first episode to make her relate-able was necessary but felt kind of forced. It adds to her story but doesn't really make me care what happens to her.,7770,154,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime has been very surprising to say the least. The plot was amazing along with the charaters and their roles. This is not your typical Sailor Moon in fact this is what would happen if Sailor Moon were more realistic.,7771,155,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I loved this anime from start to finish. Don't let it fool you into thinking it's just another magical girl anime it goes much deeper and darker than that!,7774,156,2019-04-13 21:35:39
A very extraordinary anime!,7775,157,2019-04-13 21:35:39
As you guys can see I've given this some pretty high scores because for each category it was good like that. But Overall I only gave it a 7? Why is that you ask well that's easy. Madoka Magica is a Mahou Shoujo anime. I love Mahou Shoujo because it's a genre of anime that doesn't try to be all grimdark and depressing. Madoka however did that. Not that it was bad it actually did help the series become more popular; it's just not what I want in a Magical Girl series.,7779,158,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay. So this show is easily my favorite. I watched it all in one day the first time I've done that with a show though it wasn't really an achievement. Madoka Magica totally twisted the magical girl genre into a pretzel. The most delicious pretzel I have ever eaten. The story was absolutely beautiful with good animation to go with it. The soundtrack was by Kajiura Yuki so it's automatically a ten for that........I mean come on she's awesome. The characters my God my favorite anime character practically my twin personality-wise is in this show. Every character in this show was very unique and well awesome. Kyouko: I REALLY loved Kyouko. She's the one I said is my favorite anime character and my twin and stuff. She is PERFECT! Sayaka: I've never been a huge fan of her but she was fantastic. Homura: Wow. Pretty overrated but wow. Awesome! Mami: Easily my second favorite. I LOVED Mami. Madoka: I used to hate her but then I realized us humans couldn't handle her situation better so now I love her to pieces. (Homura handled the situation nearly perfectly making her EXTREMEMELY overrated. Though she was awesome.) And I'm Home/Ending 3 ripped my heart out. Translation: This show is PERFECT. Just perfect! The animation was really good though the only thing that wasn't a perfect ten. Anyways if you haven't seen it yet I highly recommend it. Like screw this review. Watch it. Now. Kyouko is love Kyouko is life.,7785,161,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wow. This show is crazy! The crap they can fit in 12 episodes is amazing! I haven't seen an ending this crazy since Evangelion! All the characters are not what they seem. The character development is amazing. The plot was extremely unexepected and the suspense was insane! I hated characters then I loved them then hated them again. It's a little preachy about the concepts of sacrifice and acting for the greater good or our personal wishes vs. the real effect that may follow. Or  be careful what you wish for  explains it well. The character design wasn't perfect. Shaft studios has a more simple or dull character style in general but everything else makes up for it. I would highly reccomend this series to anyone as it showcases how far animation skills have come. And the plot is on a grander scale than you'll see on most shows.,7805,166,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The first thing you need to know about Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is that it is not as revolutionary as it wants you to think it is. Dark magical girl shows have been done before--Princess Tutu delved into some pretty heady stuff and Revolutionary Girl Utena (if you can even call it mahou shoujo) went...well deeper. Actiony magical girl shows have been done before--Nanoha's probably the prime candidate for magical girl shootouts but practically every popular magical girl show since Sailor Moon's been about throwing around magic for peace and justice. Even looking outside the mahou shoujo field at deconstructions that throw young kids into terrifying situations--Narutaru and Bokurano had it down a long time ago graphic evicerations and everything.,7809,169,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Hello fellow anime fans!,7839,176,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This seems like another  Friendship will solve all our problems  magical girl anime on the surface but trust me after a few episodes your view on it will change dramatically The plot picks up near the end and in addition unlike most Magical Girl Anime's this one actually gives you a little backstory,7843,177,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The title of this show is perhaps its single greatest flaw. While certainly being about the typical japanese  magical girl  it is far from typical in every other respect. The story which is essentially about the nature of a wish takes an intimate look at the implications of desire and how it's literal impact may be substantially more important than the intentions that created it. The characters are somewhat contrived yet infinitely original; they follow a template similar to their predecessors and yet as the story progresses shatter that very template entirely. It becomes a question of what is wanted and what is needed and whether a child (or young adult) can actually come to a satisfactory conclusion. The struggle to answer this question and the attempt perhaps failure in doing so is an excellent plot device that not only adds intrigue to the story but forces the audience to relate with and become more attached to the young girls who are attempting to protect that which they hold most dear...,7844,178,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Taking an in depth look as to who magical girls are why they are chosen who the fight and their reasons for fighting beyond the simply  I want to defeat all evil!  Madoka Magica is a captivating journey.,7864,185,2019-04-13 21:35:39
What Watchmen did for comic books Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica does for the magical girl.  Who watches the watchmen?  is replaced with  who deals with the magical girls?  and in both case the answer to the dark deconstruction of the archetype is  only themselves those poor sods . This is by far the best magical girl series ever. Instead of relying on cliches as guidance what is done here is digging behind the cliches clawing at the reasons and bring what lurks in the darkness to light. And it is glorious.,7867,186,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Do you like kaiju? Are you interested in bite sized bursts of kaiju goodness to refresh you from your drought of weird creatures terrorizing hapless civilians? Do you not mind a paper thin plot that only serves to loosly link each monster attack without bogging the limited run time with human characters you don't care about? Then Kagewani is the anime for you. The monster sounds are good to great. The animation style is unique and overlayed with a nice filter that gives the show a greater aura of those old monster movies of days of past. Characters? Story? Who cares!? This is a short form anime meant to pander to kaiju fans and it is all it should be. In that regard it does alright for a short form anime. Could it be better? Yes! But it does ok for what it's trying to do.,7876,189,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is one of the anime where it's between good and/or bad. I've had first good impressions when one of my friends online showed me the first episode. There was a bit of sympathy towards the main character. It's like she has no one who's comfortable enough to understand her personal ability. Yes I understand that it's not ok to butt in someone's personal thoughts and plans but really people come on. It depends on their situation. What if I like video games but I go for eroge and nobody knows what I did personally. Well she might know what I'm thinking. You know what forget that.,7915,198,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: Kotoura-san's first 10 minutes truly suprised me. The unexpectedly dark and depressing theme in the beginning made me sympathize with the main character even though the main plot hadn't even begun. The first half of the show is full of touching and heartwarming stories but towards the second half things start to go downhill. Sloppy plot advancement and an overload of comedy made the anime uninteresting and repetitively boring. Just the way the second half was handled as a generic love story and a terrible crime mystery annoyed me so much and ruined my love for Kotoura-san.,7967,204,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Fastening Days is a long YKK ad but a really well done one. In the 11 minutes it tells us the story of two children who are clearly orphaned at some point currently living with an elderly woman. They go out and help people with the use of...zippers. Yes zippers. They also use zippers to hop around town and glide between buildings. It's a silly premise but it works in this short. It's cute and I'm shocked by a) how much I enjoyed watching it and b) how much my 5 year old son ended up liking it. If they made more I'd watch more.,7982,209,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Cute alternate world story of what would have happened had Tomoya ended up with Kyou. I happen to love Kyou and this episode was a cool nod to the game but Nagisa is my favorite. I wish the Kyou arc would have gotten a few more episodes though because I loved the story. Typical love triangle but it was refreshing with these characters.,8022,213,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Miyakawa-ke no Kufuku also known as  The Miyakwa Family's Hunger  is a a web anime and the spin-off of the Lucky Star franchise not too long ago. It was released somewhere in the spring of 2013. I would say this is probably one of the best short web animes I've ever watched. The only downside was that there's no season 2 of Lucky Star yet and that show was made in 2007-2008. Somewhere around there. Though I completed the whole series of Lucky Star in December 2013 I feel really bad for mostly everyone who waited for the season 2 for a extremely long time. I even waited for so long because that show was my most favorite. Of course there are certain conversations I took interest with.,8025,215,2019-04-13 21:35:39

To tell you the truth I am surprised myself to be giving such a goodeview to this Saint Seiya outing but the movie is simply stunning. Itaptures what Saint Seiya is about very successfully.

I have no good knowledge of any anime movies.  I've been more involved with shows.  I know that a there are a lot of great anime movies but that's like knowing it'll rain eventually someday.  I have actually taken somewhat of a break from regular episodic anime in order to watch some movies.  Toki Wo Kakeru Shoujo is my second movie in as many days.,8092,232,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I aniticipated watching this for a while. I'm not sure why. Maybe the story line just appealed to me and I got hooked. So I found myself watching it tonight and I gotta say I was very impressed. It was captivating funny sweet and such a good story. My only problem would probably be the ending. Gah! Why did it have to end like that? It was sweet but...frustrating I suppose. Anyways overall I really liked it so I'm not going to complain anymore. Hehe.,8097,233,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I really enjoyed this one! Usually when I watch these movies I just can't get into them and I keep checking how much time is left until it's over because they just don't grip me. But this story was pretty compelling. And unlike many other anime movies the plot twist did not strike me as abrupt/awkward/wtf. It was simply striking I just froze and was shocked at the implications. It got emotional and it all tied together it was just very good. And I don't understand all of it.  Normally I would go straight to google and find out what the ending means.  But this one I think I want to keep for myself.  I'll be watching this one again. ,8115,241,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Makoto Konno is a foolish and tomboyish high school student who spends most of her time hanging out with her two male friends. Things change one day when she suddenly gains the ability to leap through time! Initially she used her powers and did mundane acts like preventing her sister from stealing her dessert and cheating on tests. However the small alterations she made to the timeline turned out to have unexpected consequences that compile into dramatic and fatal situations for her and the people around her...,8130,245,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I highly recommend this anime! It is full of action and excitement as well as having characters that are fully developed. The plot was well thought out and well executed. Some of the main reasons I enjoyed this anime is that you can't always tell what will happen next. Also all of the characters are unique in their own ways not just your typical cookie-cutter characters that you find in this sort of show. If you love action-packed anime with supernatural effects and violence this is the perfect show. Hope you enjoy it!,8139,249,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I love Fate/Zero. I went into it almost completely blind knowing only that the main character is a blond girl and there is magic and Gen Urobuchi involved. That being said I had no idea what to expect from the show. Wow was I blown away by the amout of awesomeness that was provided to me. The premise could be written off as nothing more than a supernatural fighting show but it was so much more that that. Even the characters that you might not even like have depth and reasons for their good or evil actions. Their goals become the spring board for major conflicts and every action leads to retrubution. Characters achive their deepest wishes only to have them come crumbling down upon them. Self centered characters devlop for the better and even the most jaded unassuming ones can sneak up and steal the spotlight for themselves. Alliances are formed and betrayals rise within the span of an episode. The music and art are both top notch. I encourage anyone who hasen't checked out F/Z yet to even going in blind get on it and see the magic for yourself.,8142,252,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Ok so at first I thought this was going to be a cute little anime about some kind of romance.  Well I was surely mistaken.  This anime was so bland and boring that I couldn't even keep watching after the 1st season.  ,8183,273,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This show is a normal rom com which is what I expected from it but what i didnt realize is how well the characcters all fit together. You dont leaern a whole lot about the charceters but they were so lovable that  it wasnt even that noticable. The characters were very unique and made me laugh constantly. For a 12 episode show it gave as much as you would expect from a shsow of this calliber. ,8184,274,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I don't remember how I found this anime.  What I remember doing is going to some website here or animeseason.com went to the filter put in romance comedy and school life and boom!  I got to Bokura Wa Minna Kawaisou.,8187,275,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The slice of life/romance genre of anime is not one I dive into that often. However every year or two I manage to try my hand at one I either stumble upon or one that was recommended to me. This year that lucky winner was The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior. Based on a manga the show follows the journey of Usa a high school freshman who is looking to escape the mayhem of his middle school life and looking to enjoy a normal high school experience. However he moves to a hostel that is filled with the most eccentric and ecclectic group of characters around. However a girl he really likes also lives there and he stays around in the hopes of being able to be closer to her and get her to like him.,8194,280,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wow! I may have to go to the Dentist; this anime was so sweet I think i may have a cavity. All joking aside this particular anime was unremarkable. It has a cookie cutter plot and characters that could have fit perfectly in any other rom/com.

These videos are worth watching if you are a fan of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann but are useless on their own and rather disappointingly are not worth much even in conjunction with the original series.  The music is okay (some tracks are better than others) but seeing as all of these shorts are set to music  okay  really doesn't cut it.  The animation is not amazing and the stories...well their range is huge and they are all completely different but essentially none of them are exceptional and many of them are just plain bad.  The best were the nostaligia-inducing ones the ones where the audience gets to see Kamina and Yoko and Simon and Nia in all their alternate-universe-ed glory.  My personal favorite was the first episode where Simon Viral and Kamina saved Nia from a castle...if that sounds mundane that is because it is...and what does that say about all the other worse videos?,8220,294,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is one of the most beautiful animes that I have ever seen. The story is wonderful as are the characters and the animation. I think a large part of the magic of this show is just in its simplicity and its sweetness. There are tough issues that are brought up but mixed in with the innocence of the young girl Rin they add to the story rather than detract.,8231,300,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Usagi Drop is a delightful story about making the best of a not-so-great situation.  Rin is the illegitimate daughter of a man old enough to be her great grandfather.  It is not until after he has passed away that her father's family learns of her existance.  Not even old enough to attend school and without a mother Rin appears to be on the verge of abandonment.  No one from her father's family wants to take her.  Disgusted with his own family's selfish behavior Daikichi Rin's father's grandson decides to take care of Rin.  Daikichi is a 30-year-old unmarried male who works a hectic sales job.  The story takes off as Daikichi discovers the world of parenting without even being a parent himself.,8233,301,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Usagi drop is a lovely moving heartwarming anime and I can't recommend it enough. The kind that leaves you feeling all fuzzy and warm inside. And it's all about the two main characters which are portrayed exceptionally well. ,8241,306,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,8243,307,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Even though the anime was done recently the art is a bit nostalgic to older animes. This was probably hands down one of the best anime I have ever seen and I would recommend it to anyone. The characters and plot do an amazing job of keeping you interested and they make you feel as if you actually get to know the characters and their emotions. The anime moves slow but that is probably one of the best qualities of the anime. It goes through many big steps in Rin's(one main character) life as she grows. It shows what parents truly go through to raise a child all the sacrafices the colds the stress. Not only that but it shows the kindness of a person willing to take care of someone who no one else would take in. It shows just how much a child can change the life of a person and how the perspective of the entire world changes when you have someone to live for. This anime is a perfect display of many modern day families and situations. Again one of the best and I recommend watching the first recommended anime.,8244,308,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Raising a child isn't easy and every parent or guardian knows just how taxing all of the daily tasks can be the sacrifices that need to be made in terms of work and social life and the almost constant stream of considerations and worries. The truth is that looking after children is one of the biggest causes of stress and grey hairs (or hair loss) amongst adults but given that the majority of people in the world are (or will be) parents it's a little odd that such a major topic is still a rarity in anime.,8245,309,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is rather cute. I don't watch a lot of plain slice of life shows without action or something else to spice it up but I liked this one. It has it's downsides but it is a rather cute feel good anime. I mainly watched it because I liked the idea of watching a guy alone who knew nothing about parenting try to raise a child. I find that to be an interesting subject. I wish it had lasted a bit longer though. I've read that the rest of the story isn't as good and the ending is bad so I guess it's better that it didn't continue. ,8249,313,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Straight up I ruined this for myself by looking up the show on Google.  It was an innocent search!  I was just trying to remember some people's names and I accidentally read the ending of the manga.  I CAN'T EVEN.  It ruined the show for me and from then on everytime I watched this I got pretty reasonably creeped out.  ,8292,325,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Just about every anime made by Production I.G has consistently spectacular animation music and voice acting as well as an interesting premise to drag you in; and Usagi Drop is no exception. Although the premise is by no means original it is the most honest telling of the inexperienced parent and child relationship story I have seen in anime. You get exactly what you are promised nothing more and nothing less. Usagi Drop grabs the theme of sacrifice and rolls right along with it from beginning to end.,8293,326,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The was was great and never dissapointed me. Although it didn't the only thing that was actually special was the ending. The animation was detailed in fights and the ending but the character designed were rather poor. The sound matched all the time since I never once though the sound was out of place. The main reason the anime wasn't a 9/10 was because of the characters. I never really understood the characters even the main characters.,8304,330,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I give Heroic Age a 10 across the board.  The overall message of the show was physics. When Age and the other 3 nodos were trapped in indiscriminate space sheilded by a temporal (time) shield which is arimontos main power source he draws a distinction of what each of the four nodos represent. In other words the nodos themselves are symbols for the four main forces in physics; time space matter and life with a key emphasis on the later because that is where the top minds of physicist like Einstein Max Born Shrodenger left off.,8310,331,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series is closer to seinen than shounen. I need to clarify this point because some people criticize the series for being a bad shounen. Many shounens tell the story of the hero's journey from their home village like a fantasy epic arc Wheel of Time or Naruto. Heroic Age is right after the hero is at max power and comes back to the village to settle one last problem.,8331,338,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The story is full of determination and the hunger for success and overcoming hurdles. The reason I gave this a low review was because the story is drawn out SOOOO much by episode 41 I had to give up. Its about a young girl becoming a successful actress and deals with horrible family issues and she is innocent and has rivals. She tries to accomplish the main goal of the story but they dont actually show that it gets boring after episode 26.,8339,343,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: A modernization of a 1970's manga or a remake of a 1970's anime. However you look at it it has old roots. When you watch the story sadly it falls into many of the steroe types because IT's the one that gave birth to these stero types. The story line of a clumisy girl suddenly propled towards stardom is nearly as fun to watch as the character interations revolving around the plot. The rivailry/friendship going on plus Mqaya's relationship with with her secer admirer is fun to watch though so many clues left unnoticed.,8346,345,2019-04-13 21:35:39

High school DxD is a great anime if you like ecci however if you dont like too much then it is not for you. The main idea is thet the main character is a pervert and so that does give the writters an excucse for alot of nudity. The way that every character is aware of the main characters pervyness is done in great humor and i would strongly recomend watching as it is also extremely gripping.,8367,360,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Anyone calling High School DxD is  typical romantic comedy ecchi harem anime  is wrong. But they are also right. It does everything ecchi harem can do with a bit of spice to it (Ahem) so it's not all ecchi harem it includes more interesting sequences on the way. I couldn't get any pictures that were meaningful to the review. (All you can find is Rias Gremory's grocery bags of mens' dreams and wonders) So there are no pictures but the important thing is; Is High School DxD worth it?,8372,363,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime is very unique and is something i would recommend to everyone though it did lack romance though if there was a second season i can see that being added. Its also got a wide range of interesting characters which change thoughout the series which makes it extremely interesting to watch and who doesnt like a harem with battleships especially when the male protagonist is actually pretty cool and knows what hes doing he reminds me of lelouch though less evil. So overall i would highly recommend this anime as it was entertaining all the way to the end.,8449,387,2019-04-13 21:35:39

 Cant wait for the next season but ill tell you guys a lil of my opinion so far. It is a bit of one of those addictive animes at times escpecially the beginning episodes. Its a big rollercoaster of drama towards the end and personally I wanted to growl a few times at some of the characters actions towards eachother. The ending was alright but def could have been better had they actually participated in the big event they had tried to get in. Okie thats all ill say youll just have to watch to figure out what I mean!,8465,394,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I have to admit that after dropping it for several months I came back to Love Live!: School Idol Project not because I was in love with the show but because I'm mildly addicted to the cell phone game. Upon my first viewing I thought that Love Live! was a pleasant show with nice character designs for fairly unmemorable girls as well as some very cheerful and fun pop music floating around in the background. It was the music that drew me to the game the minute I got a cell phone good enough to play it and the game that dragged me back into the anime.,8478,398,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Action anime akin to Jormungand are tough to come by and very rarely any good. In fact the only “thriller” type action experience I can name off-hand that is worthwhile is Phantom. Another example Black Lagoon while an action anime was too long winded in its philosophy and light on excitement (thus proving my point). Jormungand seems to be the opposite of that opting for lots of gratuitous violence in lieu of a decent story or any sort of exposition whatsoever. Based on a manga of the same name this twelve episode adventure through mediocrity is not exactly going to appeal to action fans nor fans of much else. Its' boring characters lame action and unexplained everything compound to become an anime that is very rarely entertaining let alone exciting.,8486,401,2019-04-13 21:35:39

"Now this was a gem that was watched not too long ago (two days ago to be exact). The series follows one Jonah and his dealings with the arms dealer Koko Hekmatyar. Though there's a slight twist: Jonah is a child soldier who hates weaponry and those who sell them after having his village bombed by weapons sold to the local militia. After being hired Jonah follows around Koko and her other bodygaurds from location to location usually shooting things along the way. The plot itself is episodic with each episode essentially as a stand alone or as part of a series within the series. Along the way there are many philosophical questions raised from morality to  is it good to sell weapons to save the world? . ",8490,403,2019-04-13 21:35:39

As I first started the series I had the feeling that it was going to be the generic episodic type of anime. While I was right with the episodic part of it the generic side was the part I felt was wrong about Becuse some episodes will give you a great thought to ponder on about. The first two episodes however was were I had to force myself to watch. Gradually my head began to turn back to the screen on its own. While the series doesn’t capture your attention with an apparent story that builds up the trouble the characters go through is something that will. (Or if you the type of person who like to hear and see guns going off. XD),8492,405,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Jormungand to me follows the recipe of the girls with guns series. it portrays powerful smart capapble women who can at times surpass men with their capabities (a big bonus point for me). The story takes it's time but eventually picks up and starts to escalate halfway through the series. it kept me wanting to figure out what it going on and that's a good thing. The main heroine makes the series as the other characters are not as fully dimensional as her. It left something to be desired in the depth category but nevertheless I enjoyed it. It has Yuri elements so fans of the Genre should definitely watch this,8495,408,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Right from episode 1 I knew that Jormungand would be amazing! Maybe it's just the guns and violence i don't know but I do know one thing Jormungand is an action packed series with some good intelligent dialogue. Yes a lot of people probably are comparing this to Black Lagoon. I would agree to a certain point just because the settings are somewhat similar and that's about it. Everything in Jormungand was perfect from the characters to the animation. There is a lot of info given about guns and other military equipment which helped to keep a realistic feeling when watching the show. There wasn't really a main story in jormungand it was more or less just giving you a feel to all the characters and getting to know them. Seeing that there is a season 2 coming that is ok with me. This show is a must for any action fan out there and you'll also be rewarded with the great character development throughout the show.,8500,410,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This one one of the first animes I've ever watched. The story and characters sucked me in right away. I honestly can't think of any not-likable characters in this anime. Although Shaman King ended with a cliffhanger and will most likely not be continued because the writer went to work on other projects this is still on of my favorites. Give it a go trust me you'll fall in love with these characters. I've watched the whole series 7 times and I still want to watch it again. Also although the anime has ended there is still a ton of Shaman King mangas.,8501,411,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Hello watchers! Just finished watching Shaman King and i was a bit dissapointed with the ending because there was none! Other than that is it a pleasant story with mostly likable characters.I would recommened it to people who like classic tournament series. Although it appears to be for young audience it contains some brutal images and psycical and psychological violence. It has it's moments... I laughed plenty of times with the goofy and easy going attidude of the main characters but it does get boring at some points the pace seems very slow considering previous episodes. Also some episodes seem unrelated to the previous one as it shows what is happening in the meantime which is good when there is a battle going on and don't cut the battle to show what the other characters are doing but it kinda gets you confused when the episodes are story related and out of the blue you see something completely different.,8503,412,2019-04-13 21:35:39

While I am a lover of supernatural and mystical things mononoke was a an attire to me. I must confess I wasn't really sure with the animation... at first cuz it seemed so simple or at least very realistic.

The animation is interesting and at first difficult to get used to.  It is certainly not your traditional animu style.  It grew on me as the plot progressed; I even came to like it after a point.  Plot is engaging characters are mysterious without being shallow.  Music and sound is minimal though fits with the tone of the series.  Can be confusing if you aren't paying attention.  Certainly a series meant to make you sit and ponder after each episode.  Great for those who love to thrill their mind.,8595,445,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Mononoke is truly a gem within the horror genre and certainly deserves to be seen at least once (this review is based on a rewatch). It mixes a unique animation and art direction style with a story telling more akin to that of Mushishi. Indeed one could say that if Mushishi was ever made into horror the result would be Mononoke. Similar to Mushishi Mononoke has therefore no overarching plot to speak of; instead we have four smaller acts inserted over the course of 12 episodes. The only thing all acts got in common is the presence of the mysterious Medicine Seller who exorcises the world from mononoke Japanese demons. The Medicine Seller has no known name and we never really get to know anything about him yet the way he is presented is highly entertaining with his somewhat arrogant and smug attitude. Of course while the Medicine Seller is entertaining as a figure this is not where the strength of the series’ lies rather what makes Mononoke so brilliant are its supporting characters who reveal the dark side of humanity.,8598,446,2019-04-13 21:35:39

 Plot:The Year is Cosmic Era 73 two years after the end of the war betweenarth and the PLANTs. Peace had finally been achieved thanks to effortsut forth by both sides but it was not meant to last. When rebel Earthorces soldiers infiltrate the PLANTs and steal ZAFT's new prototypeundams it's up to Shinn Asuka and the crew of the Minerva warship tount them down and retrieve their mobile suits. With the war now backn full swing will Shinn and the others find a way to restore peace?,8626,453,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is a fairly entertaining show but for some reason the bad guys win in the end.  Well for the most part there really are no good guys save maybe 3 characters.  They are Meer Campbell Shinn Asuka and Lunameria Hawke.  Her sister fails to qualify as a good guy (gal) character due to her foolishly treacherous actions.  The reasons there are virtually no good guy characters are numerous.  The so called Archangel crew and the Eternal are projected as protaganists but the way they handle things reminds one of how Jack the Ripper might treat women.  Both crews essentially kill indiscriminently friend and foe alike.  ,8628,454,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Gundam Seed Destiny begins two years after the first Gundam Seed ended.  Many believe that peace will come about with the radicals of both sides dead.  The chairman of ZAFT is Gilbert Durandel who seems to be focused on peace.  As with the first series the leader of the Earth Alliance is unclear and fairly irrelevant but there are some key Earth Alliance characters who pilot mobile suits.,8632,457,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Lets start off with the biggest issue here it's two episodes long and is really the start of something that never was given a true opportunity SO we take the game Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon and make a two-part anime series about it which means you must cram all the introductions and endings of whats happening into two episodes and because that can't be accomplished with something as colossal as Fire Emblem it just...kinda sits there...,8634,458,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Fire Emblem has always been a favorite video game series of mine and I enjoyed the OVA a lot. I understand that a lot of people are turned off by it only having two episodes but... it's an OVA not a series. The story is really only about Marth's (or Mars in this dub) past a precursor to the first Fire Emblem game for NES (now on the DS also) while the rest tells a version of the beginning of the game. I think it gives a good insight into Marth's past and character but I especially liked the parts that were directly (somewhat) from the game especially the second episode with the priestess. To me it really was the video game being represented accurately. The animation is good but I'm just a fan of this style and the time period this was made. The voice acting is mediocre save for Mars himself voiced by Spike Spencer (Shinji Ikari in Evangelion). As for character development the main characters are done well but the secondary characters are just thrown to the side and those who are not familiar with the game would be very confused as to who they are.,8635,459,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Please keep in mind this is my first review. This story is about two guys and four girls who all go to the same school. They get transported to another world and the group gets seperated by certain circumstances. The world they're in apparently is in a war with two sides one being the humans and the other being evil spirits. The evil spirits want to connect both worlds to create a perfect one while the humans in the  Ne  world want to protect their world. The story had a lot of potential I think but the problem was the animation and parts of the story. The story started off well but at times it made no sense and stuff was explained really poorly. There was very little character development even in the short 12 episodes you learn little of the characters and feel nothing from them at the end. This show didn't leave an impact on me at all almost as if I didn't watch it. The character designs were pretty good in my opinion they just weren't developed at all sadly. Overall if you have nothing to watch I still wouldn't reccomend this show. But if you really wanted to watch it and waste your time go ahead. It's not that it was bad it just wasn't good.,8645,462,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sometimes an anime doesn’t need anything except for pure style.ellsing had its bloodshot skies Noir had its pounding pulsatingoundtrack Big O had the comic book world and SoulTaker had absolutelyindbending visuals. As well as the ones I’ve mentioned countlessther animes are entertaining not for a particularly coherent storyliner characters that we can actually empathize with but for a distinctnd very appealing “feel” to the show. In the same vein Hitsuji no Utas pretty much nothing but style… but what an amazing style it has.,8666,476,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay where to start. This anime was pretty damn amazing. I originally didn't give it much credit because well it's an ecchi. However I was in for a treat. This anime really was something. The characters are developed fairly the animation is gorgeous and the sound effects are just magnificent. The only real flaw was the plotting. It was paced rather awkwardly. Sometimes it felt like some episodes were drug on for the sake of stretching out the plot. The series while it had magnificent character development spent a little TOO much time on it. I mean it made the majority of the characters likable but it also slowed the plot down a bit. ,8680,487,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In 1939 an alien force called the Neuroi invades Earth and the regular military force of the Earth cannot defeat the enemy.  A new military unit called the 501st Joint Fighter Wing is created to fight the alien invasion force utilizing new technologies and females with magic called Witches to lead the battle against the alien forces.,8681,488,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'll start off this review with a disclaimer. I am a huge moetary junkie. I've watched both seasons of Strike Witches twice and read every manga that's been translated to english. I run a blog dedicated solely to moetary with 99% of the content being Strike Witches related. I've cosplayed Strike Witches I've roleplayed it briefly I've written numerous fanfictions I own more Strike Witches merchandise than for any other anime and I can name most of the characters on sight regardless of whether they've ever appeared in any manga or anime. I often fantasize about flying around in my underwear and shooting aliens. So when I sit down to review Strike Witches it's difficult for me to say I'm not biased at all. With that said I do try to think critically about it even when I have been desensitized to all its flaws by two years of on-and-off obsession.,8689,492,2019-04-13 21:35:39
In 1939 Earth is invaded by an alien forcenown as the  Neuroi.  To combat against them a special strike forceonsisting of witches gathered from around the world is formed.

A very entertainingeries with characters that are ridiculously moe.,8696,493,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This one surprised me! I started watching it thinking it was just going to be loli fanservice or something... and it kinda was but it still had a pretty good story with a really cool concept to it.  I just loved the World War II meets Magical Girl meets Alien Invader theme.  Plus the whole idea of the Strike Witches using airplane-like machines that connect to their legs and give them the ability to fly is just so awesome! (Personally I have never seen something EXACTLY like that that didnt involve Mecha doing the actual flying.),8697,494,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Some well known Japanese football players started practicing football (or soccer) because of this anime I think that alone says a lot about it. The story evolves around a boy Tsubasa who loves football more than any other thing - the ball is his friend he says - and the struggles he has to face to fullfill his dream of becoming one of the best football players ever. Every match is team face is a challenge and in every challenge there are opponents which share the same dream as Tsubasa. The tricks and plays that characterize each character of the anime is what makes it so damn funny and unforgettable especially for every kid - like me at the time - who dream of becoming a footballer.,8704,496,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wicked City is terrible. I went into it expecting to like it with its interesting premise but gave up a few minutes in. Little did I know it would get far far creepier and I'm not one who reacts to horror films much one way or another. It took me years to go back and finish watching it just to mark it as watched and even then half of the time I was doing something else while it was going on. This movie is like a recurring nightmare with the same things happening again; a woman turning out to be a demon (twice) seduction (three times) and rape and attempted rape 5(?) times. The whole idea of the movie was just cast aside in favour of sex and violence both of which can be handled well but this is not a hentai nor is it a shonen so the amount of both is out of place here and the dissonance between what the premise is and what actually happens makes this movie easily one of the worst of anything I've seen in my life along with a horrendous flashing sequence in the last 10 minutes adding a sore pair of eyes to a sagging heart. With almost every other bad anime I've seen there has been some mitigating factor; Gundam F91 and Bokurano are only slightly bad Ouran High School Host Club and Ladies X Butlers actually started off pretty well Welcome To The NHK is pretty fun to watch once but I can't stress only once enough and so on but all that can be said about Wicked City is the females are hot (though that's the case in nearly every anime) and it isn't Meine Liebe though not being the worst of anything is the bare minmum; not an acheivement. If I were to be punched in the stomach then the knowledge that the person is using their weaker fist wouldn't be the first thing on my mind.,8706,498,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This was a quick but cute 2-minute long commercial for a school. There wasn't much to it considering its length but the characters were determined to reach their studying goal and seemed to have done well on their test by the end of the short.

Not much room for character development but they actually got something done in a 2-minute time span which is impressive.,8709,500,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a relatively good series overall.  The humor can be a little low brow but let's face it that's what you turn into a series like this for (I personally love it).  If your like me this series will have you laughing most of the time you watchi it.  The plot is relatively average. It's one severe flaw in my opinion is that it tries to be Tenchi Muyo without the Tenchi.  Each of the characters in the series starts off as a replacement for one of the Tenchi girl.  The art is also very similar to the original Tenchi which instead of raising nostalgia just feels a little dated.  The music is also a little off but the dubbed voices are ok and the opening theme (when in the original Japanese) is really catchy so it does get points in my book for that.  Finally I feel that despite the awful start the characters get as the series progresses they do develop into interesting individuals.  If your looking for something with a serious plot look elsewhere.  IF you are looking for the next Tenchi you might be disappointed.  If you are looking for a cheap laugh as well as some lighthearted fun then this show might just be the fit you are looking for.,8717,504,2019-04-13 21:35:39

When I was a child I loved this anime more than  Saint Seya  but I have to rate it 6/10 because after watching it some months ago I discovered that it has many flaws. The story talks about 5 boys who are able to summon and wear element-related samurai armours (the red one has the fire armour the green one has the lightning armour the orange one has the earth armour the blue one has the sky armour the azure one has the water armour). Their enemy is an ancient demonic emperor who wants to merge his armour with the protagonists's armours to gain more power and conquer the world. The story is nothing special the plot has some incoherences the characters haven't a well developed personality and the idea of summoning armours is copied from Saint Seya. Ryo the protagonist the red-armoured samurai has too much importance in this anime he always fight the strongest villains he has the most spectacular transformation he is the one able to summon the white armour (resulting from merging all five armours) and he appears in every episode foreshadowing the other samurais.,8722,507,2019-04-13 21:35:39

After watching the first 3 episodes of God Eater. The story is actaully not bad. I love good under dog stories about how humanity is on the brink of destruction and like human nature they always pull through and go from surviving to adapting to reclaiming to conquoring. The only issue is the animation it's self with the drawings. They are a bit dull and they don't feel like normal poping colors. Every time a scene pops up it seems to be a bit of a slight delay as if I was on a buzz. Not a fan of this type but besides the color and animation it's a great anime,8751,521,2019-04-13 21:35:39

At first I believed this anime would just be another one where the protagonist has experienced tragedy and from then on they become stronger and etc eventually achieving his goal. The first few episodes seemed to be heading in this direction however I have just seen episode 5.The simple shock and suspense of how helpless the hero is while his fellow humans are getting slaughtered brought back memories of the earlier episodes of Attack on Titan. This has given me a newfound respect for this series in that they are not following all of the stereotypes to spit out an anime the same as hundreds of others.,8753,523,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I love this anime and the main story of it too. I love the fact that the theme goes through different dimensions with different guys I recommend this anime for people who like romance kind of animes and I also recommend my little monster and say I love you. ,8848,553,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I personally loved this anime. Amnesia was a great one alright. I just had gotten a bit confused. But I would just give it a 9. I loved the guys. They are just so cute! I mean you have to have an anime with hot guys right?!,8853,554,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The reason I gave the story a 6 is because the plot basically repeats itself while adding twists to each of the guys which becomes very annoying after the 2nd guy. The animation design in this is amazing the details are fabulous ! I wish there was more substance to the story.,8855,555,2019-04-13 21:35:39

(My opinion everyone) ,8861,557,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So Amnesia is about a girl who woke up one day and possessed no memories of anything. She met a spirit named Orion who apparently also had a hand in her memory loss. Throughout a series of events the herorine uncovers the mystery behind her amnesia.,8862,558,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So this is my first review (sorry for my english gh) I'm usually not into writing reviews but this time I HAD TO.,8876,559,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It's like a cute extra story if you've played the visual novel (of the same name its on steam now as well) but it's rather weak on its own merit. I'd recomend playing the VN first; you'll enjoy the anime more! ,8879,560,2019-04-13 21:35:39
so let me piont out this and correct me if im wrong but that girl did not have a name. Although it was a little confusing at first (kept screeming at my kindle asking it questions but sadly it wouldnt answer me) once i cought on i was always trying to figure out how the next reality would be. ,8883,561,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I actually was quite intriguied by this anime. the vibrant animation and the soundtrack. the opening song made me want to watch this and i am glad i did it was a intresting plot i mean i was quite confused most of the time. When it ended i was a little bit disapointed as it did not show which world heroine belonged to or that it was obivious to me anyway . But it is a otome game and it must of said it in the manga. overall i enjoyed this anime. (my first review on this site so might be a little shabby),8888,562,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story,8889,563,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is so frustrating because the story had so much possibilities and potential but it just seemed to repeat itself. The plot was interesting and that's what kept me watching it but during the anime I just felt it needed something more. It was going down the right path but it didn't explain a lot. ,8890,564,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,8891,565,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Before you decide to watch this one know that the ending is painfully BAD! That being said the story is pretty interesting so long as you don't mind being confused for the first 9 episodes.  Luckily those first episodes are filled by interesting characters with hypnotic eyes. The animation reminded me of Karnival a litte bit; very pretty. Here's the basic story line: Useless and clumsy girl gets touched by a spirit and due to 'circumstances' begins to travel between parallel worlds where she experiences romantic encounters with a series of impossibly beautiful college-aged guys each of whom seem to represent some different aspect of love. Definately reverse harem (though not in the typical ridiculous way) but not a comedy. Amnesia contains ZERO laughs! Still I guess it's a decent watch so long as you're bored and a girl.  : /,8894,566,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Although good intentions wasn't executed greatly. Characters should have been more developed. It could have easily gotten an eight out of ten if it were darker and had more gore. But as I enjoy darker anime this was a romantic lift for me.,8896,567,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Ok I watched this as a beginner anime (and I'm a girl) so of course I loved it the first time I watched it (13 years old?). If your a guy I advise you not to watch this unless your into reverse harems (A bunch of boys likeing a girl). Even though it's considered a reverse harem it's kinda not. ,8897,568,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,8898,569,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The only thing I liked about this anime is the characters eyes which are stunning and the characters themselves are attractive. If you haven't seen it I don't recommend watching it.,8899,570,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Everyone complains about the anime being a bit choppy but well the main character has no memory and is jumping from one version of herself in one dimension to another of course its choppy she stays in one world per episode or two meaning every other episode its a new world a new situation and a slightly different version of the story until the last few episdes. If you understand thats how it works and are still interested its a good anime. It seems confusing until you understand she is jumping dimensions. They dont exactly make that clear at first its one of those figure it out on your own things. Other than the confusion that lies with that its great. They characters are all the same but differ slightly from one dimension to the next so its interesting to see where they go and how circumstances change them. The animation is my favorite part. I love the look of all the characters. I could stare at pictures of them all day the animation is just that beautiful. The sound is good and other than the slight confusion the story is interesting. Overall a good watch  especially if you enjoy seeing something unique and visually stunning.,8900,571,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,8915,574,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime has a very weird story line to it. I did not like the story line very well because almost every episode the main girl character switches scences and some times it is hard to keep where she is. However the animation of the anime is very good. The characters and the backgrounds have very good details to them. The best details to the characters are their Eyes. The sound of the anime is okay I like some of the characters voices and some of the songs in the anime. However some of the songs in my opinion are a little creepy. I like most of the characters in the anime because they are really awesome people but the other people I just really really dislike them for some reason. So over all this is a fairly good anime if you want to look at it that way.,8917,575,2019-04-13 21:35:39

At first i didn't like it it reminded me of Brothers Conflict at first with the series of guys but as it became more confusing i kept telling kyself  just one more episode . I would recomend any girl to watch this. I have never felt so much love for a character as i did Ukyo even now when i see his face i die a little inside as each of the guys have a chance it is great for everyone as it doesn't end with her having to choose just one. Absolutely adored it and the most lovable characters i think i've ever encountered absolutely brilliant soty and characters.,8934,582,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This one had so much potential. I generally like stories involving amnesia so the beginning was intriguing; but then it just fizzled into a sort of lame  which one do I love more  thing that you never really feel like you care about.

Detective conan is super good because it has that  smart/deduction element . On top of that they throw in some scientific (probably not possible but not like magic) stuff on top of all the other realistic stuff but make it sync good.,8957,593,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Detective Conan...This is one anime that Im sorry to say but I actually dont like it. Even so I consider it good. Let me explain. ,8958,594,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Detective Conan is one of those animes that will make you start guessing thinking and probably develop your logic at some point. The only problem is that Conan is seriously really really long and at some points we might get unmotivated to watch it episode by episode. Some of it is episodic others are not which makes watchers afraid to skip several episodes in fear that they might miss a story to the bigger plot.  ,8959,595,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,8960,596,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is one of the longest running shows for a reason.  The plot is always original and keeps you interested in the characters. It takes a serious murder mystery and wraps it in a fun and quirky half-childish shell.  I highly recommend this one.,8961,597,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Giant basketball playing robots. That one statement would have been enough to make me turn away from this series in a heartbeat. Thankfully however I began this show blissfully unaware of the plot and was able to see Basquash for the quality it had. Admittedly the basic premise sounds ridiculous and when you throw in the strangest pet sidekick I've seen in awhile and the fact that the sport played can barely be called basketball its strange that I liked it as much as I did.,8967,602,2019-04-13 21:35:39

story: looking for an exciting story which can keep you engaged this is what I found when I first started watching this to me I paid no attention to how detailed the story was I took each episode as it came and always wondered what happened next. i was entranced from the first episode until the 26th and i was still wanting more. Once you’re through the first 3 episodes you become engrossed with the protagonist and then the ecchi jokes begin which put some people off the story but they don’t affect the enjoyment at all after another 2 episodes the jokes die down and the story’s development begins again as each episode gets more detailed and exciting with you watching on the edge of your seat as I was and still am. ,8972,604,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a pretty fun and funny series with a promising look for more episodes and seasons to come.  The main male character is almost a joke in and of himself who is way to boisterous and loud to be real.  He is like a cliched overbearing male character but cliched intentionally or so it would appear to me.  This is a bit of a shift from other animes which seem to use cliches as if they were manufactured components in some anime industry.  It has a quirky yet different twist on the common magic and school themes yet there is a strange cross over.  It looks pretty clear to me at least that several characters have essentially either the same powers or powers that can elicit comparable results.  The creator?  In theory could she not do anything anyone can do with such a god like power?  Black flame? Isn't that kind of the same as controlling the elements though only controlling one with slightly different properties.  Set back girl can do the same things as the clock girl and vice versa.  One of the down sides to the story is given these powers it kind of feels like their imagination lagged abit when thinking of them and perhaps worse in thinking of the names.  That aside the humorous dynamic play among all the main characters is akin to watching great comedy sitcoms like Friends or Cheers.  Another slightly irritating issue is the harem cliche.  Why do so many animes have the exact same story save for slightly different details?  ,9013,619,2019-04-13 21:35:39
For a series that might be mistaken for a mix of slice of life and action by the title there's barely anything that would pass as either over the 12 episodes it aired.,9014,620,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime quickly became a personal favorite of mine. While it isn't perfect it is very charming. It has wonderful animation and an interesting plot. The plot can be a bit random as these types of shows usually are. But once you get about halfway you will be 100% invested. I pray for a season 2.,9015,621,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Obviously I'm going to be the oddball reviewer giving a quick once over of the other reviews.,9062,635,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime had such tremendous promise in the first few minutes.  It was never going to be a masterpiece but it had the potential to be immensely entertaining.  Of the countless directions I thought it might go after the protaganist's death at the very beginning I never thought it would devolve into the kind of worthless mess it ended up being.  The most outstanding feature of the show is that everyone is cast as either an S or an M with most being masochists.  This is not the campy sort of fetishism that can be amusing in a side character but the in-your-face two-dimensional totality of every person in the show from the two main characters all the way down to strangers on the street.  Add to this the fact that no one changes grows or develops because after all nothing really happens and you're left with a full season's worth of anime watching that you can never get back.,9063,636,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Very weird but funny (depending on your sense of humor). If you are after any sense of normallcy you aren't going to find it here. Each episode gets weirder than the last.  The last episode was argh different.,9065,637,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Shigofumi is strange.  It mixes an interesting premise very dark themes and mental disorders with a touch of goofy humor.  It's episodic and yet has a coherent overarching plot that gets developed in every episode.  It shouldn't work but it really does.  Weird stuff happens a lot of it.  But it still works somehow.  ,9077,640,2019-04-13 21:35:39

A good anime to watch if you are very much interested in currency as it shows many aspects of just that. There are 2 main characters who tend to be partners in the beginning but show love interest later on in the story. It shows plot twists as the characters change dramatically and you see a new side of them later in the story. Overall great show ,9088,643,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Spice and Wolf is rather unique for a fantasy anime; it doesn't focus on fighting magic action ect it focuses more on religion trade economics money amongest other thing. The charm of the seires is the character Holo and Lawrence watching them chat and interact with each other is were the joy of the series comes from they both bring out the worst and best in each other. They're the perfect duo.,9117,650,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Before I do anything I feel that I need to address something. Yes. The first two or so episodes have a naked Holo in them. However the artists did not add any “girly parts” to these scenes so Holo has the body of a Barbie doll. Also these scenes are done so tastefully that it isn’t exactly fanservice. Now that that’s out of the way…,9130,656,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series caught me by suprise as I only watched it after it came up as a recommendation for a few of my other favorite series'.  Not having heard anything about it before I quickly fell in love with the characters of Lawrence and Horo and watched the entire series on a single Thursday afternoon.  I very much liked the setting and animation but the music while fitting got on my nerves a bit with the overuse of horns.  Small frusturation aside the story is excellent and I can not wait to watch season 2 this weekend!,9154,659,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Now I know what you're thinking:   Oh joy!  Finally a show about the detailed inner working of a medieval trade system.  And it even features a naked wolf girl with no nipples!  How could this possibly be bad?   Well if you will lend me a few moments of your time I shall explain specifically why I didn't like this show.,9166,664,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,9167,665,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is one of my favorite animes thus far.,9170,666,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The premise doesn't do it much justice as it sounds dull. A travelling merchant and a wolf deity (A goddess of the harvest) travelling up north engaging in serious business and economics at a slow-pace. As boring as it may sound it turns the economics into something compelling and interesting or at least I saw it that way. This definitely depends on what you find fun as even though it explains the economics and logic of coinage and currency this isn't everybody's cup of tea.,9172,667,2019-04-13 21:35:39
When we think of anime fighting giant robots supernatural battles and a lot of BOOBS just comes into our minds. But there are a few unique types anime that are much as charming as the others.  . I am your host Bilguun alix and today I will review an anime called Spice and wolf an adventure/romance anime aired in 2008.,9175,668,2019-04-13 21:35:39
If there was a single anime that I could call my favorite it would be this. I loved the music the plot the characters and the actors/actresses who voiced this. I watched both seasons twice and I'm at the edge of my seat waiting for season 3. This is the type of anime that you'll watch one episode get hooked and want to punch the producers in the face for not finalizing/releasing the final season.,9177,669,2019-04-13 21:35:39

However I watched a few reviewsor the show and my curiosity was piqued which made me go ontounimation's website and watch a part of the first episode to testhether or not it had the substance to grip and entertain me.

Spice And Wolf,9203,674,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Spice and Wolf is everything a jaded cynic who hates everyone and everything should hate. It is subtle gentle full of positive themes patient has charming characters with small flaws that don't really detract from them full of friendship and budding romance and is generally not too complicated. I really should hate everything about it. Yet here I am writing a glowing review.,9204,675,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Honestly I don't know why this show appealed so much to me. It might be the mythology that is told throughtout each of the battles or perhaps its the fact that I like just about all the main characters and their personalities. Alongside these two things I honestly just like the core part of the story and that is the main lead Kusanagi Godou being confronted and targeted by many different gods/ goddesses and Campiones. As each fight dawns upon him he is forced to push himself to the limits and along the way become more able to confront the ever-growing challenges. I greatly hope for and await a potential season 2 especially since there are so many deities left unaccounted for. Well that and because I just want to see Athena again. =P,9221,681,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This will be my first review as I normally just provide my rating for a show and leave it at that but Campione! was such a mess that I felt compelled to warn others to avoid this disjointed monstrosity so as not to waste your time as I did. I've sat through some pretty bad shows and never felt this strongly about how poorly a show was done before so that should tell you something.

I have a love-hate relationship with A-1. They either make high quality shows that tops the charts every year like Anohana and Birdy or very promising shows that faceplant mid-way such as Sword Art Online or Oreimo. When I saw that they were doing Subete ga F ni Naru I was really excited and really scared. Subete ga F ni Naru is an amazing mystery novel by Hiroshi Mori that I've read several times. Either they make it's anime adaption a masterpiece or completely blow it.,9252,689,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Plot:,9282,698,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I've never been too fond of people defending the old due to the narrow mentality that everything pos-modern sucks however I choose not to have watched GX or 5Ds of the yugioh saga because of the fact that the cliche representations of good versus evil just outweight the regular cardgame as it nearly did with the oriiginal. The story sucked due to its quick-paced slap-in-the-face telling that made everything run by too quickly no to mention the lack of imagination when it came to the overall duel. The amount of monsters used was minimal and all the strategies did was kill and bring back and bury and then revive and destroy the same old monsters. I don't know I think I have dragged this review too far but I definitely don't recommend this movie to anyone I only watched it because I thought it would be cool to have three protagonists o different sagas come together.,9284,699,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The stroyline was great at first but the ending was very disappointing to me. For the most part all the characters were great there were just a few that bothered me but that's sort of expected in an anime. I'm hoping for season 2 since the ending wasn't too great. It was funny but kind of a cliffhanger. ,9289,702,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I actually can't remember how I came upon this anime or what motivated me to give it a try. The title of the show alone is enough to create a questionable first impression. However I'm glad I ignored my unfounded initial misgivings because despite its flaws this series delivers entertainment where it counts.,9290,703,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I refuse to spend more than three sentences telling you why this anime was terrible and a waste of 30 minutes; occasionally I watch things like this just to remember what I'm not missing. The premise was juvenile the voice acting worse than nails on a chalkboard the characters wholly uninteresting and the story nonexistant except to cobble together some stereotypical and unimaginative ecchi scenes. It gets 1 point only because the timeline was coherent and the animation was decent.,9317,715,2019-04-13 21:35:39

How to explain…? Heh I don’t really know how. The bestpisodes were by far the last 4 or 5 especially episode 25 that explainedverything in detail. Some of it was good and then some parts were asking me torive a stake into my head due to Shouko’s retardedness. That ‘drove’ me up aall. The 3 demon sisters are by far the favorites of mine in Touka Gettanlong with Momoka and her story.,9322,717,2019-04-13 21:35:39

When I reviewed the previous season of Sora no Otoshimono I mentioned how much I dislike the ecchi and harem genre and how much I love it. Regardless of how much I love or hate the genres Sora no Otoshimono Forte once again cements in me that there is hope and there is some originality to be found in a genre populated by lackluster titles. Now I’m not explicitly saying that Sora no Otoshimono Forte is absolutely amazing but I am explicitly saying that taken as a whole Sora no Otoshimono is probably the best harem/ecchi anime I’ve encountered so far. In many regards it falls into conventions: but it plays those conventions well and manages to be balanced—especially this second season—in that the serious plot and the comedy are intermixed perfectly.,9325,719,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sora no Otoshimono Forte (Heaven’s Lost Property Forte) was surprisingly good. It built on the previously series incredibly well and improved on its lacking areas without losing any of the charm or comedy from the first series which made this anime so appealing.,9327,721,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Circuit Angel is bascially about a high school girl named Mariko that is into bike racing and she's really good at it. She seems like a regular high school girl when she's with her friends but she's really tough and won't back down from anyone. She gains a rival in Sho a rich kid that is also really good at bike racing. They have a big race at the end and well you have to watch it. There are other things going on to flesh out the story. For a 45 minute OVA it's good. There is fanservice but not much. I'm a fan of older anime so I really liked the 80's hand drawn animation. It may not be for everyone. The animation was good quality not top notch. Sound was good I liked the ending song. Characters for a short OVA have decent development. For me this was surprisingly good. If you like action it's here if you like a little comedy it's here if you like heartwarming elements it's also here.,9331,724,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I personally believe that you can't take other people's word for what is good anime so keep that in mind when I say that this season was SO GOOD. I mean it was SO GOOD. Usually after a successful first season all you can really hope for is some okay episodes to go back into their world and you get to find out some new things. I thought it was like that for Nisemonogatari; it was good but just not really  fresh.  Nekomonogatari surprised me with how good it was as a continuation and then THIS...,9335,728,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This short is an absolute waste of time. The entire thing consists of two claymation figures playing some sort of weird game that involves hitting each other with a hammer. There is no plot the only characters are poorly shappen clay men and the sound is crap. Avoid at all costs it's seriously not just  bad  but a waste of time.,9337,729,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I'll start things off with a warning: Don't watch Nadia: The Motion Picture if you haven't seen the original anime first. Viewing the original series first is a prerequisite to understanding and following the references in the film as nothing is explained further for you and if you haven't seen the series you will be bombarded with a lot of fragmented previous storylines that make no sense in the film's plot.,9345,737,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Akagi Eiji it the main character and he comes from a family of boxers. His father was a famous boxer in his time but Eiji only remembers his father as a boxer when he was at the end of his career and not very good. His older brother also boxes. Eiji himself is not interested in boxing. He music career fails. He has a rivarly with Kusanagi Naoya the High School Boxing Champ. Naoya has an interest in Eiji's childhood friend Marina. Eiji has an interest in Naoya's sister. So it's like a slice of life from a male's perspective with boxing and some comedy.,9348,740,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Okay. So I had been wanting to watch NGE for a couple of years. I finally watched it two years ago. Everything was going fine then BAM the last to epsiodes.

It's been 15 years since Evangelion was released it used to be hailed as the end to all anime. The biggest coolest and deepest show ever made in Japan. Now does it still hold up to modern anime? Without a doubt yes it may not be the best ever made but it's still a damn fine show. That is knowing that I generally dislike mecha and sci-fi anime. Good sci-fi is about never breaking suspension of disbelief plot and characterisation not robots battling interstellar threats. The cool thing is this show combines it all.,9392,763,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Back when this anime was new a lot of the concepts they used were pretty fringe stuff. Even now a days not a whole lot of anime dissect a character's psyche in such a serious way. And the concept of semi-sentient mecha was and I think still is a brilliant and far more interesting concept than just a standard mech.,9409,769,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I don't really understand how this anime has so much ranking. It is a big dissapointment for me. Maybe it presented  new ideas  for mecha anime for its time but there are better anime out there now that is more worth watching. It begins ok but toward the end changes its format and it just becomes a methaphisical mambo jambo. The End of Evangelion Movie tries to explain their theories a little bit better but even so they just vomit a long monologue of bullsh** that even if you understand what the author is trying to say its going to leave you with the question  So what's so great abut that? . There is nothing to be impress by this anime the hero has the most patetic personality ever and I rather recommend you to skip this anime or you will be dissapointed or rather  feeling disgusted  as the own series says at the end. ,9421,772,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I juuuust cannnt do it. I wanted to like this show since there is a ton of hype online about how great it is. Unfortunately it is just a little too juvenile for me. I only watched about 4 or 5 episodes but it felt like self-punishment to sit there and watch any more.,9423,773,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Interesting storyline since I don't want to give away anything to those who haven't watched it. I'd just have to say watch it because this is one anime that I can't really give a description for.

What is Neon Genesis Evangelion? Is it as some have said a work of art one of the best television shows ever made and the product of a visionary genius? Is it as others have said an overrated piece of shit fueled by cliches that is nothing more than depression and hot air? Or is it as many say an excellent show that the creator ruined out of a combination of spite and desperation? Is it literature or is it nonsense? Is it even entertaining? Moreover--years after  Congratulations  in a world profoundly changed is it even relevant?,9442,781,2019-04-13 21:35:39
To start off I was intrigued from the beginning of the series. At first I did not like any of the characters so I'm not sure why I was so intrigued but I just was. I rated the show 4 out of 5 right after the first episode. As the episodes continued I was filled with this same intrigue even as I felt nothing substantial was happening. I found myself periodically doing other things while listening to the English dub. Even though I still did not  love  most of the characters what I cared about most were their interactions. However what I think I enjoyed the most about this series was the overlaying theme about self and reality. I find myself dissenting from FalseDawn's review because for me the pinnacle was the final 2 episodes. I do agree with FalseDawn that the ending does not end anything. I feel that this might very well be the point that the creator was trying to express. That our reality never ends. We create our lives how we wish them to be and it never ends. I loved this psychological mindf*ck. Often I am disappointed by mindf*ck but this was just right in my book. It was set in place at just the right moments and in such a way that instead of simply confusing you it made you think about your very existence. ,9445,782,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This series is a bit of a disappointment to me. It started out well andhe built up was really great and suspenseful. Come the middle thection became more intense and made you come back for more howeveromewhere near the end it really loses steam.,9446,783,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well yes this is a review of school days and I know pleanty of people hated it for allot of reasons but Honestly the story characters and animation are all solid. The story is dark and depressing but it is not bad. Honestly I found it very interesting that they made the main character in this show generally just a stupid and bad person. He seemed to believe that the only way to deal with women was to just ditch them when it was convienient and screw someone else until the other was ready again. I would say that most people's hate for this show is not geared toward its plot or story but rather towards the main character and thats understandable I hated him too. However the story was good I am left with no lingering questions the visuals were good and the audio was solid. Each major character became someone you genuinely cared about and the show does a good job with that. As a guy I genuinely wish I could somehow be in that show so I could be the voice of reason to the main character since hiss seems to have died long ago. Overall I would say if you want to see a show where for once themain character is the most despicable pile of evil and immoral crap on the face of the planet then go watch it. I do not regret watching it but as a result of the main character and his  antics  I wont be re-watching this series myself...like ever.,9447,784,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I would say this anime is one of the most famous animes besides other known titles. There are so many different opinions about this anime that it is actually terrifying what one anime can do. Fact is majority are saying that this is one of the worst animes ever made. There are unknown of times when I have read some romance anime comments and one of the most seen type of comment is “I hope this doesn’t end up like School Days”. Because of that I had to take up my own amazing hammer and give out my own honest opinion rating different aspects of the anime. But small warning ahead following parts will contain heavy spoilers so I recommend first watching it then reading this as this review is more based opinion as well.,9451,785,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The story was catchy in the beginning but during the later episodes it became very very boring and i just thought during the episodes  Oh wow another chick WHO expected THAT .,9455,786,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Kinda sucks,9464,787,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Like most anime they're funny. This one starts off like any other anime but as it progresses it gets more serious. A must watch but be mentally prepared watching this can leave you speechless for hours or even days. I would say that you must finish and not stop half way into the anime.,9465,788,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It's the second day of Spring.  Love is in the air and you want to sit down and watch some lite romance to ease you into a chipper spirit.  Well if so you've come to the wrong place.  In a sentence School Days is a harem love story where shit.gets.real.,9467,789,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This would have to be the most emotionally crippling anime I have ever seen in my life decent animation but if you don't enjoy suicidal thoughts I wouldn't bother watching.,9471,790,2019-04-13 21:35:39

School days. Very lighthearted title. This anime however isn't so lighthearted. What's great about this anime is the way it breaks foundations. It begins as a fairly ordinary anime and will proceed not as you expect it WHICH WILL UPSET MANY PEOPLE. Not everybody is used to such strange turn of events main characters the audience may not find appealing and events happening as they would in real life not as you'd expect them to in all the other happy animes that are out there.,9488,794,2019-04-13 21:35:39

School Days is in my opinion a popular and infamous for having unlikeable characters. I first discovered the anime and I thought it's some generic comedy harem but it was the complete opposite. The anime was made by the studio of TNK in the summer of 2007. The same one who made the anime adaptation of High School Dxd. School Days also got mixed reviews and it's controversial.  ,9496,799,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Oh my F***. Thats the best description for this anime. It has a great story and breaks the normal slice of life/ Harem anime structure. Very enjoyable and you should definitely watch this. ,9498,800,2019-04-13 21:35:39
The STORY in School Days has easily earned it a 10/10 with it's unpredictable ending.  Let me just say this now:  Do NOT watch School Days if you have not had your fair share of normal annoying harem animes.  When I first watched this anime I hated it.  I couldn't believe I wasted my time on something that ended so freaky.  But now that I've seen my fair share of harems (Spring 2011 line up anyone?)  I feel more confident in saying the story was so amazing and so much more realistic.,9499,801,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,9502,804,2019-04-13 21:35:39
School Days may look like a good anime at first and it is. But once you finish the series you'll see how fucked up it really is. I would only recommend this one to guys who have cheated or are thinking of cheating on there girlfriends. I gave it a 1 out 5 because it a good anime but i wish i never started watching.,9503,805,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Worst romance ever exception to Twilight. So forced and melodramatic. I prefer Nana's romance to this and it isn't even a romance anime/manga. Albeit I seldom watch romance and 5 Centimeters a Second biased me because it was pretty good but this stinks.,9504,806,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Well well well. Where should I begin?,9507,808,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I knew it would destroy my heart and mind if i watch it because i heard so much about this. Always seeing someone saying its nothing to compared to School Days etc...,9509,809,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This is my first review so don't expect professional quality but I had to work out my impressions of this show somehow.,9510,810,2019-04-13 21:35:39
!This review had spoilers in it!,9513,811,2019-04-13 21:35:39
So I actually tried watching this one time before but stopped because I just hated the main character.  Much time later my cousin asks me if I watched it.  I told him that I only watched the first 10 minutes and that's it because the protagonist annoyed the hell out of me.  I humored him and watched it and was this... a ride.,9515,812,2019-04-13 21:35:39
i liked this anime up intill the last epasode wich scared the hell out of me i will never watch it agin the story line was good and i enjoyed most of the show i liked the characters except mokoto he got what he deserved good animation i feel they could have made a diffrent non viloent ending i am kind of aprencenive a bout anime like that now due to the surprize ending sound was great well thats all i got to say about this anime if you want to watch this be perpaired for a shocking ending,9518,813,2019-04-13 21:35:39

One of my favorite animes. This anime has twists all over the place & I highly recommand it to anyone who likes things that are always going on. I rated the story cause I really like an anime that has a twist every episode. Its one of those animes to where you just wanna watch all the episodes in 1 day. The animation is pretty legit. Sound is good also. I had no trouble with it at all. The characters are the best cause this is an anime people can relate to in real life if it really came down & dirty. NO Spoilers! So I rate this all 10's! Write me a comment if you read this & watched it! I love meeting new people! (:  So this is many of few reasons why I love this anime. <3,9522,817,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story - I watched this because a lot of people said not to. I just wanted to see what was so bad about it. I can see why. You may hate the very existence of the anime but you have to remember it's a based on a game which has mutilple endings so don't hate School Days just the story the anime followed. I felt bad for Kotonoha the entire series. She didn't deserve that. Ito is among one of my most hated characters ever. And I don't hate that many.,9540,827,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a weird choice of anime for me to watch willingly because I'm usually not into romance-based storylines. The reason I did watch it though is because the reviews I read told that it wasn't your typical romance series and it has one HELL of an ending.,9558,835,2019-04-13 21:35:39
if you read the other reviews about school days on here  you will most likely find that a lot of people dont like and/or cant stand this show. yes i am part of that majority  but for a somwhat diffrent reason. i say somewhat because while like most people i hate the main character makoto itou to death  in my mind there is one reason and one reason alone that seperates my hatred for this show from everybody else: i actually thought the story was good for a bit. yes thats right  as ludacris as that may be i actually thought school days had a good story going for a few episodes.,9561,836,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Despite what you might have read already from previous posts I'm here to tell you about a psychological drama that will leave you thinking a whole lot about being  one of those guys  as my sister puts it. Yes we can sit here and argue that it has elements of harem and romance but the reality is it's none of those if you actually pay attention to the story. Anyway here it is your moment of Zen. I'll try not to post any spoilers for those who haven't seen this yet. Keep in mind I did say try. Moving on...,9562,837,2019-04-13 21:35:39
It was an amazing anime if your looking for some romance sexual content(you dont really see much its all just said and interpreted) Harem and ecchi......unfortuantly the only thing i did not like about the anime was how at first you loved most of the characters and it was all together a great anime but in the end i ended up disliking almost every character just because of the plain hypocrisy that they live by that and it will leave you with that  empty feeling  that some romance anime's can give you if your one of those type of people......regardless i would suggest this anime to anybody........it was great and kept me at the edge of my seat......i will warn you though the ending is graphic and grizzly in ways so if you don't like violence or you don't like anime with blood or gore you might not like it. I watch action adventure mecha ecchi romance feudal japan mystery horror episodic anime etc.....so the violence didn't bother me it was just not the ending i was looking for even though i had seen part of the last episode anyways i kind of forget about the whole thing as i watched the anime because it really does suck you in to that point. Once again great anime and i would suggest it to everybody but some people may have weak stomache's might get that empty feeling in the end or just might not like the layout of the story......i have an open mind.....if you want suggestions for other good romance/ecchi anime's check out Yosuga No Sora(it's an incest anime but it has a great story and the incest play's a very little part up until the final episodes of the show) Koi Kaze or Okusama Wa Joshikousei........both of those are only in Japanese Dub's with English Sub's but i prefer my anime's that way because american voice acting is terrible and often times they don't translate it right or they change up what was originally said to make it less violent or more suitable for audiences of a younger age and when i watch an anime i want the original story created by the Asian/oriental author not some sugarcoated crap......that's just my opinion....i watched Case Closed AKA Detective Conan in English until i got to the episodes where there weren't English dubs and stalled for now but i will continue watching it once i watch a couple more anime's........soon i'll be doing reviews on Please Twin's Kiss X sis(not the OVA cus i couldn't find it all yet and i have other  show's too watch in the meantime) and Akane Iro Ni Somaru Saka. ,9563,838,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Wery first of all.... the whole anime was a bit stupid all epsiodes was about a guy who is constantly having fun with a bunch of girls and none of thew knew about it. Dating one girl and cheating on her with another (and some few more)..... Srry but this stuff I can see on TV and not realy like it.,9568,840,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I must say after watching this I was shocked. I couldn't stop talking about it to my friends and made all of them watch it. A few stopped halfway through because it was just to  messed up  Others thought just as I. This is one hell of a psychological anime!,9575,841,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I got to say I was really looking forward to watching this anime and I got to say the first 7 or so episodes were really good. To start I must warn people that this anime takes the harem genre to dark place. The idea of comedy isn’t present in the latter half of the series so if you’re looking for your typical light hearted harem then look someone were else. This anime is all about the jealousy love and betrayal.,9587,844,2019-04-13 21:35:39
'This Anime Really.. My honest opinion I liked it but the fact that the main characters are so blindly stupid reminded me alot of myself. The anime is good but if you read the manga you'll know that the main character makoto is set in a bad light in the anime. You should go read the manga in my opnion to see how that story developed. I really dind't like it that the main character fucked every girl who he came across with and the ending well it is just crazy. I mean you've to be mental retarted to even cut of the head of your boyfriend and take it with you everywhere and it's also sick to cut open your friend to see if she's fucking pregnant. The anime seems really nice and a good romance story in the beginning but after the first 3 episodes the shit goes down under.. Really it made me rage so many times xD But i've to admit it was one worth looking at and you'll see that some guys and girls are like this in real life. They just want sex no one cares about the problems they bring. This is just a perfect example of how the yought is these days.,9588,845,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Well i must say that the story wasn't so good as i expected. The main character Itou is terrible with women and his personality is... Rather strange. The animation and sound was good. but characters and story were bad. I am sorry but that is how i saw it.,9591,846,2019-04-13 21:35:39

All I can say is...WTF.  I was not expecting AT ALL what happened at the end of this anime.  Would I recommend it yes.  Would I say it is good relationship anime yes BUT it it goes to the dark side.,9600,850,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I read somewhere that this was widely considered to be the worst anime of all time and that is why I watched it.  So going in knowing that there was a very grisly ending I didn't think this was nearly as bad as all that!  I would not watch it again because I absolutely hated the main characters itou and sekai and towards the end the drama was just too absurd with itou sleeping with everyone all at once.  But really this was just a soap opera and it will keep you watching even if you are bored because it's kind of repetitive. a lot of the same things have to happen over and over before anything results from it. so it's not a great soap opera.  but it wasn't like the worst anime ever created.  I expected to be sitting there like wtf the whole time and I wasn't horrified with how bad it was like i have been with some other animes that other people consider very good.  so yeah if you like a lot of relationship high school drama you might get into it a little but i don't think anyone who watches this would watch it twice. like every other soap opera ever.  ,9606,851,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I kind of hated this show but I give it such high ratings because it was great at what it was trying to do: upset you more than anything you've ever watched could.,9608,852,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Even though the start of the anime is really slow and boring and it looks like another kindergarden-relationship anime a few episode into it you fina a real melodramatic jewel with betraylas schemes and even a real headblowing spin off in the end.,9611,853,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This is a simple story of teenagerspoli-cornered love sex betrayal and descent into madness. The true ending is one of the most shoking things to have been ever created by mankind. People; this where GRRM grabs inspiration to write A Song Of Ice and Fire when he's out of ideas to continue. It's that schoking. On a personal note: Sekai and Makoto earned their fates. I feel so awful for Katsura.,9627,858,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I have mixed fellings on this one. On one hand I despise the male lead. Every other character I like though and I even enjoy the incredibly dark twist the plot takes at the 11th hour. I know people have this anime on their worst ever list but you have to give it credit for even being willing to pull the rug out from under you.,9629,859,2019-04-13 21:35:39

i never thought i would be so f-- bored to actually write a review but this is my first and why because this anime is messed up well i admire the fact that how the love from those two can  be strong and thus makes me feel sorry for them as well as the rating of 5 for character though i thought of 6 but for wacthing this anime you need to have your own opinion of love as this can end in two ways you hate the male main character or you want to kill him oh well in a sense it's the same and that's how it ends. i suggest this to all of those in your teenage youth as this can teach you a lot about relationship with each other and it will make you think a lot more seriously about a relationship. btw the final episode is not for anyone who is afraid of brutallity.F-- this non realistic anime and look forward to the ending as you move through the anime.,9673,869,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Greetings fellow anime viewers(and people bored enough to read another review by me) its RandomRedneck with a review of another show.

Quite good when it's being light-hearted but is tedious when it's more serious. The elder sister/matriarch is hilariously lecherous and the other characters are ok but this is not an anime I would be tempted to revisit. Above average but nothing more.,9708,876,2019-04-13 21:35:39

If you watch enough anime and trailers for anime you get a feel for what the show will be like both the theme and style of the anime. This is the one time I was fooled. Ok the trailer was funny it had its little cleaver moments but when I watched the anime (dub version). I was disapointed. the trailer was better then the real thing. I liked the charactors and the anime overall could ahve been quite funny but the jokes were flat compared to the tone the trailer set for things to come. I want to unwatch it and get the time back to spend watchign better anime. ,9718,879,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Watching any fantasy genre in anime form is always a unique experienceimply because it never follows the same rules as one would expect whenatching something produced in a Western nation. Oftentimes the heroesre completely inept at what they do or in the case of a certainorceress who shall remain nameless often seem more diabolically evilhan the villain. Rune Soldier features an interesting mix of elementsound in both hemispheres and fits the genre's standards pretty wellhile breaking the mold in a few places at the same time.,9736,888,2019-04-13 21:35:39

I highly reccomend this anime to everyone! What's great about it is it's fairly short; so you don't have to take time out your daily life just to watch it. Each episode is about 5 minutes. And for an anime that was so short it did have a pretty interesting story! The story is pretty much that chocolate has been banned and that there is a group of people trying to change this law; having underground chocolate parties and what-have you. It's a very interesting concept that I have never seen in an anime before! The animation wasn't that bad either. It combined 3-D animation with 2-D animation; having the robots and vehicles in 3-D. The characters are also very easy to love. Two friends (Huntly and Smudger) team up to bring back chocolate for their crush Louise. That was actually the other problem their names could have been better. But if you don't let their slightly awkward names bother you you'll probably easily fall in love with the characters. Besides Huntly and Smudger are pretty cute if you ask me! And that's kind of the reason why I started to watch it in all honesty. Mostly because the kid with the weirder name--Smudger--looks an awful lot like Syo Kurusu from 'Uta no Prince-Sama' kinda makes you wonder... Also you may have noticed that I gave the sound a seven it may have just been me but the dub track sounded a bit 'meh'; not the acting rather it was the quality. It probably sounded that way because it's a web series but my comment still stands. However the short yet incredibly catchy ending theme song was what really bumped its score up! Seriously listen to that song and tell me that it's not catchy! Overall it's a pretty great series! It's also a good one for people just starting to get into anime. It's short cute and not ecchi in the least; pleasing anime fans of all ages! You would be crazy to pass on this series so check it out!,9745,892,2019-04-13 21:35:39

No.. Just no. If you were thinking of taking up a random anime this is not it. Don't even look at this it will give you a bad taste that will lasts up to 7 years. This unholy abomination will ruin your day after it you will never venture to randomland the adventurer in you will die and you will get aids. After watching a full episode you will want to eat your kids and piss in the fishtank because this is the curiosity that killed the cat and the local vet.,9750,895,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This anime was amazing!I thought it wasn't going to be very enjoyable because I don't like listening to boring politics but it was great.I loved the romance between a Lycan A.K.A a werewolf and a vampire.Ahlove that's not meant to be.The story line was all in order and made sense so that's a good sign and you can understand what they're talking about because they explain also a good sign.There is plenty of romance and violence.The thing that makes me think there's going to be a season two is she says  Most likely she and I will be forced to face each other someday. (correct me if I'm wrong.)So cross your fingers but don't go around saying there's a season 2 because I'm not sure and don't want to be blamed for disapointed fans.,9778,908,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This anime surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. When I started it I wasn't to impressed with the first episode it was funny but didn't have much going for it other than that. I decided to keep watching to see if it would have any action involved and luckily yes it does. Before I knew it I was sucked into the story and couldn't stop. I was sad that the series was so short but it left you satisfied with the ending. The art is beautiful and the voice acting is done very well fitting the characters amazingly. All in all this anime is one that I would recommend to others to watch.,9781,909,2019-04-13 21:35:39

This series is definietley one of my favorites. At first i was thinking  meh....it is okay...  but as the story picks up pace you'll be hooked.The story is unique yet has a sense of familiarity because it includes some elements found in other movies/anime. The animation is impeccable (in other words extremely good). The sound is genuisly used to created the desired atmoshpere and mood (very good). Because this series is pretty short i feel like there were alot more characters yet to be developed. The whole story concentrated on the 2 main characters but i really wanted the creators to explore the story behind other characters. All in all this series is definitely one of my favorites and i recommend it to everyone :D,9795,918,2019-04-13 21:35:39

There was a flashback of Naruto's and Sasuke's pasts. Their rivalry and their friendship and that warmed my heart. The music was very enjoyable and I loved the ending. It left me wanting more and I'd recommend to any fan of Naruto to watch this OVA.,9799,922,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Pretty dramatic beginning. Then we get the tragic flashback story of Sasuke and Naruto. The ending is the real kicker with such an epic feel. I don't want to give it away. Let's just say it leaves with you an eerie sensation and you want to say  Whoa   What?  and  Nice! .,9801,923,2019-04-13 21:35:39
I feel... kind of meh about this. But I think that is largely my fault. If I had watched this back with the episodes it belonged with I think I would have enjoyed this OVA so much more. But because I've watched six months past when this OVA aired there isn't as much tension and drama for me. Also the OVA is so short that you hardly have time to figure out where you are and what was going on at this time in the show.,9806,924,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Jigoku Shoujo (hell girl) is a 26 episode long episodic supernatural horror anime about revenge hate and abuse. It’s certainly a unique anime and one that makes the viewer think about the likes of bullying blackmail abuse and just outright being horrible. It does get repetitive a bit quickly but is also a bit freaky and seems to rely heavily on the idea of heaven and hell: i.e. religion. It was certainly entertaining for a bit and reminded me of my own errors in the past.,9820,932,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Having one good idea is never enough. You constantly need to reinvent yourself. And the same goes for an anime. A good premise is not enough without the evolution of the story.,9826,937,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Story: The stroy is basically about human emotions about revenge sadness anger pity hurt. For the first half the episodes are fairly episodic then the Shibata's make the scene. From then on it's reason versus emotion and emotion always wins out in the end. The anime shows that nothing is as black and white as it seems but that human emotions cloud our judgment. It's a poignant message that often gets lost in the dynamics of the show.,9829,938,2019-04-13 21:35:39
This honestly has to be the best series I have ever seen. Truly a wonderful series my only regret is that there isn't another season. PLEASE this is a must watch!!! All three season of Jigoku Shoujo (Hell Girl) are absolutely stunning!!!,9832,939,2019-04-13 21:35:39

Story: The story was engaging and had interesting stories to tell. Yes it is repetetive but it gets more interesting as you progress through the story. It's not until after about 5 episodes you get into more suspensful histories and events. It wasn't the most original storyline as some people may say it's the same concept as Death Note it didn't bother me too much. After 20 episodes you get more into Enma's history and death. It kept me curious for the entire end of the series. If you watched the first few episodes and thought it'll be the same over and over again just keep watching. I assure you it'll be worth it.,9839,942,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The animation is beautiful I love the way it's so realistic and unique. The music is beautiful and creepy at the same time. I also love the charectars but in this season they don't seem to get into them very much which makes it a bit boreing sometimes. Overall this is a great show but not the best season.",9855,947,2019-04-13 21:35:39
Jigoku Shoujo is one of those anime where you wonder what all that hype is based around. What really disappointed me the most was that for a 26 episode long anime only 4 of those focused on the main plot making me wonder why this anime was not made into an OVA or half season since the format would’ve fit so much better. Further I ended up with a bad aftertaste of Jigoku Shoujo trying to mimic Le Portrait de Petite Cosette that I think is a superior anime in that it achieved its goals Jigoku Shoujo doesn’t. The similarities between the shows are striking as well. We have a girl who is trapped within a liminal existence due to horrible events that happened in the past and now the girls are trying to exact revenge. Both shows espouse a rather gothic atmosphere and explore the dark sides of the human psyche but what Le Portrait de Petite Cossette has in favor is its maturity that Jigoku Shoujo unfortunately lacks and instead often comes off as childish and silly.,9856,948,2019-04-13 21:35:39
"I really enjoyed this anime because it told different stories about what people endured and the reasons why they did what they did. The storyline might have been a bit repetitive but hey I kind of say it's worth watching til it actually reaches the climax of the story. So it's kind of like if your not one for repetition just be patient when watching this anime. I guess what they say is true saving the best for last. ",9857,949,2019-04-13 21:35:39

The STORY for Hell Girl although it held so much promise was presented so poorly that I found it very difficult to get through this series.  Every episode consisted of the same premise: Someone damns someone else to Hell Hell Girl tortures them and then takes them there.  I didn't feel good about watching people damn others to Hell and almost decided not to watch this but I stuck through it - and for nothing might I add.  Out of the 26 episodes there's about 5 that actually do with the plot.  The others are all just episodic horrors.  While that could have been interesting for say 3-5 episodes; it was not okay for 20.,9861,951,2019-04-13 21:35:39

It truly is an amazing show and i was very impressed with the character developement and storyline. i really hope that the mangaka for the manga heals and continues the manga so the anime can also start back up.

This show is definitely a strong contender for one of the best adventure anime out there. The bonds of friendship are something that we cherish and this shows the lengths that one might go to protect the people we love. The shows ability to give different powers and use them intelligently always keeps the viewer on their toes. It still has room to grow and I would look forward to another hundred and fifty episodes. ,9886,968,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Different yet similar from number 1 on this list. This anime is heavier on the dialouge than Dragon ball Z is but the amazing fights are still there. You have the mentally unresonable still developing hidden potental main character. He meet many people who he befriends on his journey to find his father. an anime wothy to be on my top 5 animes.

Although I did stop watching the first one during Greed Island and perhaps if I rewatched the first one all of the way through I may have despised that one equally as much. So why a 1 rating? Simple this anime turned from being alright to being complete trash during the Greed Island series.,9907,980,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,9910,981,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Love this anime! It's in my top 10 of all time. :D,9911,982,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let me just say this is my first anime review and it's because hunter x hunter 2011 is one of my favorite anime. Top three actually (following naruto and fullmetal alchemist brotherhood) i finally fiinished the last epiosde today（9/23/14）and to say it filled my heart with butterflies emotions and finding the person who create this and tell them to continue this damn series (DONT YOU EVER STOP!!!). The anime is great fantastic actually it drags me into the storyline and gets me attach to the characters quick and I mean it because until now I can never start on bleach. You can never hate the main characters not even the main bad guys you just can't because they are all badasses. The music is beautiful and the animation is beautiful I mean have you seen the manga? the art is like level one compare to the anime. Overall if i can i recommended everyone to watch this funny touching and heartfullfilling anime.ALso I usually don't like to buy dvd of any movies or anime because come on why buy when you can watch for free online any time you have internet access right? Well let's just say for the past 19 years of my life i only brought 2 dvd's of my favorite movie/anime of all time one is howl's moving castle by studio ghibili and i love it. and second avatar the last airbender. and i had promise myself that while watching hunter x hunter that when this series finish (WHY DID IT END???) i will get the dvd and i will keep my word and get all 148 episodes whenever it's avaiable. ,9916,983,2019-04-13 21:35:40
FASCINATING. I loved it from the very start. There was not one episode or one moment in any episode where I got bored every single second in this anime kept me on my toes. I loved how the story evolved and it still brings a smile on my face when I compare Gon and Killua from the very first few episodes to the last few episodes. Amazing plot development and character devlopment in this series. The very first few episodes threw me off guard because they were so light hearted and somewhat corny but as I kept watching I was so pleasantly surprised to discover just how mature this anime actually is. There is so much variety and I am certain that almost any anime lover would enjoy it. Humorous heart wrenching action filled and light hearted this is definitely one of my most favourite animes.,9917,984,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As someone who has watched both the Hunter X Hunter adaptations and read the entirety of the manga currently released I have to say that the 2011 version is the single most well done anime adaptation of any manga I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Through out the entire 148 episodes they followed the manga to the dot. Through the entire anime they managed to keep a super good pace of combat training and relaxed life for the characters. No matter which arc you're watching they manage to have character to impress and woo you into favoring the anime even more and even in the cases that the character who captured your heart dies you thirst for more because of how well done every even halfheartedly significant death is. The animation was in my opinion flawless from start to finish captivating the feelings and powers of every single special attack and unique power that was conveyed through the manga. The way they animated every character and the presence of each character was also flawlessly well done catching each and every chill the characters delivered through the manga. They managed to go through this entire story until the most current arc of the manga without ever having to resort to fillers and has set a perfect example of an anime can be perfect without fillers & excessive ecchi. What could make it even more impressive? Instead of bullshitting the story until they could continue it they choose to put it on hold until they have more to work with. I look forward to the next adaptation of HxH because it will be yet another work of art. My only unsatisfied portion of this entire anime was their music choice and even that came to catch onto me as time went on. Hunter X Hunter(2011) is in my opinion one of the single most well balanced animes ever created and the easily one of the most perfectly well done shows I have seen. In my heart HxH is a 10/10 forever only losing that .25 in review purely due to opening and ending music choices. Despite my lack of taste in chosen intro/closing music I feel the sound used to express this anime is only a hairs breath away from being the absolute best it could have been. Through the entire anime I never found any problems with how the sound was portrayed as it was perfectly placed and the voice actors chosen for everyone fitting their role in the story to the T. I have to thank the developers for bringing this gem of an anime to life for those of us who love HxH!,9919,985,2019-04-13 21:35:40
when i first started this anime i had no interest with the fact the main character was a kid. a few years later my taste in anime expanded and i decided to give this anime a chance again and boy am i glad i did that. i am still not done with this anime (only episode 81 currently) and all i can say is wow. i love the characters and you get to know even the side characters. HISOKA IS THE BEST <3  anyways. whoever claims this is a  kids show  needs a slap in the face because this anime has A LOT OF GORE IN THE LATER ARCS. i mean it has a few of that here and there but then it just piled up. im not a huge fan of gore but the story is so good. just so many feels.,9922,986,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ah the Gundam series first aired in 1979 still ongoing has spanned numerous anime manga OVAs movies and video games. The anime series are mainly politcal dramas but with mechs. Then there was the 90s cheesy series that I've heard both good and bad things about mainly good. (The fact that it's cheesy doesn't bother me.) Anyway in 2013 Sunrise decided to take the franchise and make basically a kids show. Was it good? Well what are we here to find out about? It isn't science the meaning of life or how hot this celebrity is. (I don't know much science don't care for philosophy and I don't know anything about celebrities) Ladies gentlemen and playboy Italians my name is Ayanamisenpai and today we're going to be reviewing Gundam Build Fighters.

Abel was so innocent seeming then he turns into the ultimate bada** and ylu are all wow priest boy got some moves! so seeminlgy innocent priest trying to save the world destroying one evil creature at a time. The sound effects were great the animation was beautiful the supporting characters added flavor and the plot was intriguing. I wanted the story to go on forever. They concluded what seemed to be an arc before ending it but it was so good and I loved Abel so much I wanted it to go on and on. Someone so pure should not be so awesome. It seems so wrong and yet Abel makes it work so well the poor tortured soul. I wont spoil it though you'll learnt he why of it when you watch the anime.,9940,997,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Trinity Blood could have been a good anime but it fails to deliver. The premise is interesting presenting all the elements necessary for an exciting political intrigue story but the shortcomings and drawbacks are so many that I'd say you can safely avoid watching it. ,9941,998,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Trinity Blood Review,9944,1000,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The manga is here as well wanna know why coz the series is great. A world where Vampires exist to the point they have there own city (they call themselves Mathusela) and also where the humans live not in fear but in preperation of battle (they call them Terrans) but also where the scariest of all a vampire who feeds of other vampires (Krusnik) is on the side of the vatican...but wait how many of these are there..do they all work for the vatican? this story gives hope to the lost and falsehood to the wicked give me a high five pure human strength is showcased in this baby. Cool characters make the moving plot even better total top tenner,9947,1,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY for Trinity Blood had such potential that it kills me it didn't live up to it.  I think that the basis was interesting - test subjects vampires that eat humans vampires that eat other vampires the Vatican brothers fighting (Trigun anyone?) etc.  Sure not everything has to be perfectly original but I thought it was a strong enough plot.  However it was conveyed so poorly.  First of all I think there was a problem with the length.  When there is an anime with that intricate of a plotline that's when you start planning your 50+ animes (and they can be good if properly planned).  But all of the information in Trinity Blood felt forced to be included in it's 24 episode span.  (On a side note while the Biblical names were interesting - they made no sense and followed no Biblical telling other than Seth Cain and Abel were the first children of Adam and Eve recorded.  But Lillith is not even in Genesis).,9948,2,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The anime was pretty good but the ending was horrible. I recommend reading the manga and the light novel rather then seeing the anime.,9949,3,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This isn't my favorite Naruto movie but it wasn't the worst thing I've seen either. If it wasn't for how much I liked the ending I would have given this movie a lower rating. The biggest problem with it for me was that it felt a little slow and Hikaru's character arc (as well as his father to some degree) felt a little predictable. Though even with the predictability I loved watching them during the finale and seeing who they had become.,9950,4,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,9951,5,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be honest I think this show is amazing. It's a setup for another fanservice ridden and unusually done harem setup. And it gives a setup that it thankfully never delivers on. Every girl has their story every girl is unique and all come to like him for reasonable causes. The fanservice is almost non-existent an amazing and praiseworthy thing in this day and the sexual humor isn't horrible or overused. Most of the jokes are on the characters and who they are not how they look or what they are. The only potential negative is that it kind of rides on the gimmicks of it's characters a bit much but those are a rather small complaint as no arc for a character drags out needlessly. I say give this one a watch as it deserves it. ,9952,6,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Rokujyoma no Shinryakusha is a simple anime that captured me from the start. Its not amazing story wise nor are the characters anything new but the series was good to watch from the beginning.,9955,7,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Red Garden is a show with unique art style really beautiful maibe the most appealing thing on this anime that could be called the josei equivalent to Gantz: high school students died but were resurrected by unknown people who made them fight monsters if they still want to stay alive. This show got the same problems than Gantz an interesting premise that finally didn't go anywhere becuase the screen writters couldn't develop well the plot. In this case the supernatural fights the main cast has to do are a few compare the screentime wasted in boring slice of life that doesn't go anywhere except show us the characters personality. There's the other problem: the characters. Four girls who has different personlities and lifes each one of them were meant to be complex but with mixed results.Sometimes they are well written but other they can be annoying like Rachel or simply useful like Rose. The other too Kate and Claire end up being too weak. The rest of the cast doesn't steal the spotlight pretty meh.,9968,15,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Right off I'd like to say if you decide to watch Red Garden I highly recommend you also watch Dead Girls afterward. Being a kind of after story well concludes the girls endings that Red Garden kind of leaves a bit open.,9969,16,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story - Just like another Clannad except colder and in winter time. And just like Clannad it had individual character arcs where the main character does something to help out the various girls in his life. The first arc was with Makoto. The was the saddest part of the show but I enjoyed it. Next was the Mai arc where the show got weird. I mean I did'nt think the show would get as magical and supernatural the the Makoto's arc but it did. It wasn't as good as the Makoto arc but it was definitly exciting to watch. The next arc was the Shiori arc which they could of just left out. This was probably the only thing wrong with the anime. Shiori just kind of bored me. Then it  comes to the last few episodes where where it combines Nayuki's and Ayu's story for the finale. Just like the first two arcs it entertained me. Was sad but I liked it and it was a really good story.,10005,35,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This Kanon is the double-length remake of the rather debatable 2002 supernatural high-school drama anime. Was this remake really necessary? Very slow to start it does drag out what was previously 13 episodes but it does give substantial explanations for things. As for romance or harem those things are barely present. Or perhaps they appear to be done in a different way than usual cos I barely noticed anything indicating either of those genres. I generally don't like iffy dramas but this had me in two minds. This anime is capable of invoking emotions in someone as cynical as me when it really shouldn't be able to and I've got to commend it for that. But it still has a lot I really hate some contrived plot aspects and many things that don't make sense. Let's get on with it.,10029,44,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved pretty much everything about Kanon the characters were really cool.The only problem was I kind of got confused at the end had to read up on wikipedia to understand the ending more.,10030,45,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I just finished watching Kanon (2006) and i must say it rocked my week. I didn't expect the anime to be as intriguing as it was. The anime had a few moments where i litterly burst in to tears (and I normally am as good as immune to those  tearjerking moments ). The story was funny sad and dramatic but at a level that it wasn't  forced . The characters were great and did evolve in the sence of events (something that sadly is starting to become less more frequent in anime). It started as your normaal school life anime and ended like a true drama anime. The thing I'm gonna point out now will be farely obvious but it did remind me greatly of clannad (this being kinda obvious because it's from the same studio). The animation and sound were great. I would recommend this anime to everyone who loves drama animes but also to people who are new to this genre or prefer more violent anime. This is one anime you must have seen.,10040,49,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I should probably say this first this review will have more Clannad references then you can shake a stick at because both anime are very similar but also very different so there's that.,10043,50,2019-04-13 21:35:40

   Zettai Shounen or Absolute Boy in the english version is a supernatureal-daily life anime. This anime starts off with a terribly bored teenager Aizawa Ayumu. He's supposedly enjoying his stay in Tana village while on his vacation. As he explores the village he meets several other characters with different personalities. There are also spiritual apparitions made by beings called  fairies . As time passes the story advances to a new  phase  which takes place quite a few years after the fairies' mass apparition. New characters are introduced as well as new intrigues between Ayumu and the new main character Kisa.,10050,55,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I did not get past the first episode and I didn't have to. From public groping to a sword fight that ends in both characters have not clothes from the waist up I knew what to expect. Did I mention that the first episode begins and ends with the main character sucking the shit out of two different women. At some point the director of this anime has to realize that there is a difference between perverted anime and animated porn. Am I a saint? No. I've watched stuff like Freezing before but this is too much. So for all those pervs out there welcome to another season of fanservice ecchi boobs porn and more boobs. Seikon no Qwaser ll awaits you. P.S. I was too lazy to do a full length review also sorry for any and all spoilers. I will do better in the future.,10059,60,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There are indeed lots of titties in Seikon no Qwaser and the second season is really no exception.

The BEST of the Rozen Maiden series. Just made me loveuigintou even more then in the series. Great backstory on the history ofuiginto and Shinku. Really loved this one. It truly is the best of the 3 so far. I really wish they would animate the part of the story where he's in college since Shinku and the gang are still with him then.,10119,89,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This short backstory tells the history of Suiginto #1 and Shinku #5.  Oddly enough and with a strange bit of ironic twist Suiginto is already an Alice at the start.  From the qualifications described as to what makes Alice Alice Suiginto fits those best before she gets her upgrade.  She is sweet cute vulnerable lady like dependent but not a bother pretty social and well she is nearly perfect.  It is never made clear why she was made first but not finished as can well be implied by the nature of their story.  It becomes somewhat clear as well that before Shinku meets Jun she is far from perfect or an  Alice .  In fact she in some ways resembles #4 or #1 (after the upgrade) more than either pre upgrade Suiginto or post Jun Shinku.  Why these facts are not made clearer but merely implied for the viewer to draw these natural conclusions from is unknown.  Then again maybe getting a glmpse of what  Alice  is supposed to be is part of the reason.  Maybe she was incomplete because she would lose that vulnerable innocense or because she would never become Alice if she were complete.  Perhaps she was the model by which all the following dolls were meant to follow in with an understanding of what  Alice  is.,10122,90,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is sucha a good anime because of the story line of it. The story line is really good. I like that it has a set plot to it and is sticking to it as much as possible. I also like the animation of the anime because it is fairly good considering that it was made in 2009. They did a good job with the details of the characters and the scenery. The sound of the anime is really good. I like that the music doesnot drown out the voices of the characters. This anime has really good music to it along with awesome character voices. I like most of the characters in the anime becuse they are suportive and caring but the others I really dislike. ,10132,91,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the single most beautiful anime I've seen coming out of 2009.  Simple movements such as kneeling down then simply standing up were done with such qaulity that trying to watch older anime has become a pain for my eyes.  If nothing else this show deserves a round of applause for achieving such a beautiful show.,10135,92,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Awesome story arcs. Senjougahara is awesome. Araragi’shoughts and comments are hilarious along with his actions and reactions toarious things throughout the series. A lot was left unanswered but I’m hopinghe 3 internet episodes answer most of them. Kanbaru is indeed a very kinkyndividual she’s very honest with everything. Hanekawa and her “meowhahaha”as great I can’t get enough of it. The last 3 episodes were by far the best of the bunch. Love Hanekawa quite a bit <3. Overall a great anime.,10152,98,2019-04-13 21:35:40

While on the lookout for something to watch I stumbled upon this little anime. After watching it I could only compare it to a rollercoaster. Why a rollercoaster you might ask? Well like a rollercoaster this anime started by getting me to that frist hill. You know the one that you look down from as you slowly creep over the edge praying to God that the ride doesn't kill you. Once you go down that hill everything is fast paced and you may not know it but you're having a blast too! That was kind of the anime for me. A little wierd but that's just how I role. Cause when you look at it as a whole you find it to be a rush and you're having fun too. It's also like a Rollercoaster in the regard that when it's all over you wish there was more.,10156,101,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've had a lot of trouble with this anime. If you didn't know there's a LOT of dialogue. The show is mostly just dialogue and the focus is character interacts. It's also got some ecchi for sex appeal. I found it interesting for the first 2 episodes expecting some action but nothing happened. Then there was some action that peaked my interest but then there's more dialogue and dialogue and dialogue so my interest wanes. I'd say the best action and things happening you're going to get is the ending. I was really focused on that and there wasn't soooo much dialogue. I think this is a you love it or you hate it type anime depending on how interesting you find the character's conversations. I really just wasn't feeling it. ,10162,103,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Honestly I knew from the start this anime was not going to impress me.  I kept on watching for the sake of hoping it would get better.  This was a really strange anime.,10163,104,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First and foremost Bakemonogatari is a series that almost completely centers around conversations.  So anyone who doesn't like reading a lot of dialogue really won't find Bakemonogatari to be all that appealing.,10165,105,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a pretty good anime that I have recently have finished watching. I felt that the characters were somewhat bland and 2 dimensional. I felt that the told us nothing about the main character and how be became a vampire they should have made it longer and went into detail about that. I think they should have expanded upon the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend so that it would have made it feel more completed. I also think they should have expanded and finished the subplots they started such as the main character finding a college. Overall this was enjoyable and funny anime but its just too bland and loose to become a great or good anime. I recommend this anime as a good time waster it may not be the best anime but it could have been better if they just extended the series a bit.,10189,111,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This animation is incomplete the reason why it famous is because of art style and awesome manga style reference which we can't see in other animes. If you love reading manga this is definitely yours. The story is like wtf from wtf you can't see what is going to happen you can only get what is happening now. The story twist is deep only advanced manga reader can get it. However with the anime video facts this animation is not good. less than average so only few people will love it. And its not easy to follow.,10197,115,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So I tried to watch Bakemonogatari.. but I couldn't get into it.,10207,121,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay it kills me to say this and this goes for the sequel Nisemonogatari aswell just read the manga. The anime is slow and quite boring because it's all bland and visually unappealing. This does make a for a good manga though. Reading it was a total blast.,10209,122,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Bakemonogatari is one of the very first anime I've ever watched online in 2011 initially it didn't have a good impression on me because the many walls of text and the 3D'ish backgrounds were a bit annoying but the dialogues are so funny and interesting that everything else doesn't really matter anymore the first episode was enough to get me hooked in the whole series.,10213,124,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wasn't the most excited person to go in and watch Bakemonogatari. The idea of a supernatural series that decided to focus on dialogue threw me off for a bit. But one day I said  OK I'll try it how bad could it be?  So I tried and I gotta say I really liked this anime.,10216,125,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Bakemonogatari is a strange kind of story. It doesn't fit neatly in any category of anime which is a good thing. It can appear as a slice of life type anime simply because so much of the time in the anime is spent sitting around talking. There are some intense action sequences though and then of course the supernatural elements. But the action and fantasy aspects are spaced so far from each other you can't help but get relaxed and interested with all the conversation going on.,10219,128,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story,10232,130,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There’s some debate about whether or not Bakemonogatari (pr. bah-keh-moh-no-gah-tah-re) is an ecchi/harem. A mere six seconds into the first episode one of the female leads is introduced with a panty shot and several shots of panties boobs and butts are dispersed throughout the series. Aside from two characters that appear in a few episodes Araragi the main character is the only male and he’s usually surrounded by females who’ve developed a fondness for him after he helped them in some way.,10236,131,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is synonym of atypical. From the messed up story passing by the strange and whimsical cast of characters of the animation style this series breathes difference. Based on a Nisiosin work and produced by the Shaft studios  I quite enjoyed it.,10237,132,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let me start of by saying I'm not much of a pro within the Anime universe. I have watched a fair few series by now yet none of them are particularly related in genre nor would I not be able to name a single studio or famous author/artist behind the scenes. ,10238,133,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you haven't already read my review for this anime read it under the firs season of Junjou Romantica. I jsut wanted to say that if you watched the first season and are starting or already finished the second season was I not correct in how wonderful of an anime this is? I want there to be a third season but I highly doubt there will be....SAD!!! T_T ,10241,135,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Fangirl-like talk ahead please skip it if you must. It will be written in all capital letters. ",10242,136,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Now that's what I'm talking about...I had a difficult time with part one of this show because it was all a bit superficial and you didn't really get to know the characters like I hoped but that all changed here. We got way more in depth into their backgrounds and the main story arc was just lovely. All in all I can't wait for season 3.,10244,137,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As soon as I finished the first season I clicked the link for the second season. Although I don't really give a damn about the other couples Misaki and Usagi continue to draw me in. When Misaki finally admitted to Usagi that he loved him I was so happy and relieved mostly because I had been screaming at him to do it since they met. The sex was censored just enough so you think you see what you know is there. Although I didn't like the opening song for this one as much as Kimi=Hana (the opening song for JR1) it was still pretty good.,10245,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I LOVE Digimon. This show was my childhood as a kid and was a huge inspiration to be as a budding writer. Because of the new movies coming out I decided now was a good time to watch the show again but this time the sub rather than dub as I had never seen the original.,10260,147,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When it comes to 'childhood shows' you grew up watching there comes a certain kind of dissonance between the experience you had as a kid and the experience you would have as an adult. Rewatching Digimon Adventure recently I realized that it's the kind of show that wouldn't sit well with you if you think too much especially when compared to other better anime. Objectively speaking it's not a classic and one would certainly have to retain some sense of nostalgia to really enjoy having this adventure. For an anime created to promote the virtual pets merchandise however it is a well-produced series that offers a few surprises even for the more cynical audiences.,10271,152,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is hard to get in to in my opinion. it starts off reaaly fast but its really lame off the begining. ok so the whole show is pretty lame the voice over in dubbed (couldnt find subbed if there even is any :`() for the digimon it doesnt suite 80% of them i loved edomon puppetmon gotemon and gomamons voice thery suite and there cool XD.,10276,153,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So I haven't done a review in a while but honestly I haven't had such love at first sight with an anime since i watched the first episode of soul eater. (Not to say this is as good as Soul Eater honestly they are different and can't really be compared etc etc.) Point is I fell in love with the idea of the story of two people too good for the real world transported to an alternate dimension. ,10301,162,2019-04-13 21:35:40
No Game No Life is fun and entertaining but nothing more. The story isn't great nor are the characters but the plot is smart enough and well-narrated with a good-pacing and likeable characters. And there are loads of fan service.,10302,163,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of the very few good animes that is designed around the gamer world. This one uses intelligence wordplay and careful analysis of rules to find loopholes or flaws of a game in order to overcome it. This makes it unique and different from many others. It has a cute charm to it and very funny. The colors and art are really modern and make this enjoyable and without it the anime would be no where near as good.,10313,167,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really like the animation of this anime.

There absolutly needs to be more seasons of this. The ending just leaves you wanting more. I'm a huge gamer myself and the way these two think ahead of time before their games makes every gamer I know look like trash. It's just so amazing to me to think that gaming is much more than just how good you are. This anime has truly made me feel like there is no such thing as luck or change. You are the one who decides the outcome of everything based on your actions.,10348,182,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Shiro is only thing which is worth to watch in this show. Show might have been better if there would not be forced characters like Stephanie Dale useless character who did not add nothing to story except in episode 1 + key,10350,184,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I kind of don't remember how I came across this.  I think I've heard many good things about it and was really curious.  I've been thinking about watching this for some time maybe at around when New York Comic Con was happening which was around early October.  It took me until now in late December to finally watch it now with my school semester over as I stopped watching any anime all together.  This is the first serious anime I've watched in a while but I recently watched Plastic Nee-san which was really... something else.,10355,188,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is just.. wow. First of all there is little to no story so if you're looking for that I'd turn away now. However it is an amazing anime and I would ''stay tuned'' if I were you! This anime follows the story of Sora and Shiro siblings living as NEETs in the real world. However lurking in the distance is the urban legend that great gamers will be transported to another world. Surely enough the siblings get transported and now live in this world where all disputes and decisions must be decided through games! The anime has a strong theme of competition and thrill as these two cuties battle through a world of hard work.,10370,195,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is off the chain rawness.  Sora and Shiro are two of the most rawest characters I have ever seen.  I would not want to play them in real life if they actually existed.  I mean I would lose before game even begins.  I mean they even say it  Blank never loses.   The game is won before it even begins.  I mean seriouslly Sora is the master manipulator and Shiro is basically the human computer.  There is no way that Blank can lose/,10372,196,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Allright. It's been a while since I've done something like this so bear with me as I try to find my way again.I did quite a lot of them in the past on a different website which you can find here: http://legendsofsatura.net/index.php/forum125/6-reviewing-guild.html,10375,198,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Though No Game No Life is a great anime with a great story some of the characters are too strange to get over. The nudity is also a major problem. Most of it is completely unneccessary but added for comedic input. The main characters siblings are both extremely creepy especially in their sexual actions. However the great story makes this an anime that is absolutely worth it to watch even through the creepiness of some characters.,10378,199,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I am so in love with this anime. There are serious moments and strong emotional bonds between characters that you grow extremely attached to but there are also segments that are just hilarious and full of guilty pleasures. This has become my favorite anime thus far. It's a mix of Death Note Ouran High School Host Club and Sword Art Online. Watch it. The main characters Sora and Shiro are master strategists and genius' who will never fail. Ever. Their ability to mentally break down every move and find the best possible next one is gorgeous at times intimidating at others but their journey to their victories is always harrowing and hilarious all at once. I swear up and down and sideways and all the directions that do and every will exist that this anime is the best out there. Proceed with precaution and remember; Blank never loses. ,10379,200,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Adding more than a overall score to Digi Charat would be making it a disfavour. Nothing is really especially good about Digi Charat but nonethless I like it a lot. I'll break it down into the various scores anyway but as I said I won't be giving out any numbers it just doesn't work that way with Digi Charat.,10397,208,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is they story of a pervert manga artist who is obsessed with pants. Yes pants. This was quite funny at first but quickly got old. The story stayed pretty much the same throughout although it was unique the characters never seemed to make any progress with anything. However I liked the idea of it being about a manga artist and thought it was very unique. Its a real shame the story was ruined by countless comedy and ecchi moments.,10405,209,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tl;dr: Short episodes mean this series isn't so bad.,10407,211,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It is said that there are four types of people in the world; those that know and know that they know those that know and don't know that they know those don't know and know that they don't know and those that don't know and don't know that they don't know. It's clear right from the start of this series that the main character is in the language of the show a pervert with an insatiable fetish for women's undergarments. And if that truth is enough to turn your head in disinterest or disgust this is probably an anime for you to skip. But while the viewer is fully aware of Aito's proclivities there's something a bit different about him than can be found in many other stories with characters like him. He is oblivious to his tendencies and how they effect those around him. Stated differently he doesn't know and doesn't seem to know that he doesn't know. For those not ready to dismiss this story by way of first impressions there are some good laughs and endearing moments to enjoy.,10408,212,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story - After watching this season I finally realized that FMAB is not the best anime in the world. Clannad and Clannad After Story is. It was just so amazing. It starts out with Tomoya helping out his best friend and I think he did an good job. When it gets to the graduation point I got sligtly dissapointed that the whole gang wasn't around anymore but it made since because that all got jobs and had lives. So I got over it.,10418,215,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show is amazing when i watched the first Clannad I had some tears on my face. But when I Saw these 2 certain epiosde's I couldn't stop cring it was so sad i had red eyes for days after that. Just watch this show it has a great story and Characters. but it is very very very sad I never cried so much before. This show is just a masterpiece of sad,10424,219,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My main problem with Clannad After Story is the first 8 episodes; those episodes really serve no purpose then to develope side characters from Clannad who don't really need developing. I just wanted to see Tomoyo and Nagsias' relationship develop - however after episode 8 this soely becomes the focus of the series - the ups and downs of there relationship and Tomoyo really develops into one animes best characters. Episodes 16-22 have some of the saddest moments I have ever seen from an anime and will test those with hearts of stone (I sobbed about 3 times during those episodes - episode 18 was the saddest).,10429,220,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is before stateing anything by a long way the most soul crushing animes i have ever had the pleasure to watch. To people who dont know much of this beloved anime you may wonder why i would call an experence of saddness an experence that i would reccomend to almost anyone well hopefully i can explain why in this review. ,10431,221,2019-04-13 21:35:40

After managing to finish this anime's first season in tears I might add I KNEW that I had to watch the second season nothing this great can possibly go unwatched. I started the second season thinking nothing could surpass the emotion that flooded into me from watching the first season but I couldn't be more wrong. Even the shortest of chapters in this season left me in tears of both sadness and joy. There were even some parts of the anime which hit me so hard emotionally that I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish the season. However I held on and managed to finish even after being put through a huge emotional episode near the end. And even now after putting all the pieces together and making sense of the final episode which you can't really blame people for not catching onto immediately I still cannot think of the two most emotional moments of the ENTIRE anime without tears forming in my eyes. As I stated though it is perfectly understandable to at first miss the meaning of the final episode but once you put the pieces together you realize that the ending is truly a proper ending for the anime. Much like the first season I would recommend anybody watch this despite their preference on anime because this is one anime that stands out and can be enjoyed by even the most stubborn of people. It can bring a normally cold-hearted or mentally tough person into tears within seconds. By far my favorite.,10445,225,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Un animé tranch-de-vie / drame exeptionnel ! Le meilleur que j'ai pu voir jusqu'a aujourd'hui ! Cet animé m'a fais rire et pleuré (pour dire que c'est la 1ere fois que je pleure devant un animé) et sa c'est ce qui fait son 9.8/10. Pourquoi pas 10/10 ? tout simplement a cause ce cette fin très  cul-cul   que je n'ai vraiment pas aimé. Cela n'empeche que sa reste de loin je pense le meilleur de sa catégorie,10457,229,2019-04-13 21:35:40

(minor spoilers?) Part 2 of the Clannad lifetime if you've made it this far you should live happily knowing something as special as Clannad exists.See my review for Clannad not much in the terms of technical aspects has changed however the story has a lot. Prepare for an anime that actually continues outside of high school and travels through the real world. Story is similar to the first Clannad however it spends more time on stories of minor characters these are totally awesome outside experiences that wouldn't have made their way into the anime otherwise. Some of these are a lot of fun some left me wondering to myself lost in my own mind for days. WARNING This anime is more sad than the first 24 episodes however it is more than deserving of your time unless you don't like symbolism deep feelings honesty stories that reflect life and a sense of something deeper. The characters aren't around as much which is sad however more time is spent with the most important ones which is great. Character development like a mo fo! Sound is the same from the first 24 so if you don't like that sorry the sounds are always spot on though because this anime is too legit to make silly mistakes like that. The animation is the best I've ever seen smooth so so so much attention to detail so much subtle effects great pan shots well placed zooms. Also the voice acting is amazing (i watched this subbed). The emotion and feeling they put behind their words is spectacular everone feels like they match so well with their voices.   My best praise goes to this anime for continuing a romance after high school leaving the setting so many anime's are set in for the real world forcing each and every character to explore themselves as grown ups. It is done very well. No more cooking or quiet crush episode bullshit (go watch shuffle if you want to stay in high school forever). 9.5 excellent job to Clannad for making something so powerfully emotional and memorative. This one and the first 24 episodes are still funny as balls. Also you may cry.,10460,232,2019-04-13 21:35:40

the whole anime is almost the life time of this one person and the people in his life but the story it self doesn't go in order like from birth to death  not they go back and forth so they keep it fun. the first season is more like the daily things that happened in his life when he was in high school and thesecond season is more like the background story and what happened after he graduated..,10471,239,2019-04-13 21:35:40

CLANNAD a story about friendship life & much more. A story filled with sad tragedies but filled even more with love. There were moments of happiness & laughing & moments of sadness & lamenting. Never before have I been such emotionally moved by an anime. This particular anime has shot straight to my tops list. Never will I forget this masterpiece the unique characters in it & moving events that built it up.,10488,244,2019-04-13 21:35:40
CASas magnificent potential which is cut short by its horrific end. I am jaded in my opinionf Clannad having despised its characters through many episodes justo reach the After Story but still think it's reasonable to dub this aeries gone wrong.,10490,245,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hands down the best anime ever made. I am no big fan of the romance genre but Clannad After Story has become the only exception. There are simply no words that can describe the full extent to which this masterpiece touches the viewer. It sweeps them up knocks them off their feet and opens their eyes once again to the wonders present in everyday life. The plot and realistic characters manage to touch on the full range of human emotions and present a realistic story in the most amazing way possible. In addition to all this the soundtrack is outstanding and the plot is one of the few I have ever seen that sincerely dwells on true love built out of mutual friendship between two people and on important life-changing themes. I am the type of person who likes to write full detailed two-or-more-page reviews when they finish watching a show but as I said before Clannad After Story has literally left me speechless. Unbelievable! ,10491,246,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright let me get this out of the way quick Clannad (AS in particular) is my favorite anime EVER. So yes this review may not be all as objective as I like to think the rest of my reviews are but oh well. This anime had really been on my mind as of late for some reason so I thought I might as well do a review and without further delay.,10495,247,2019-04-13 21:35:40
the story line of tomoko's life at first doesn't seem all too exciting but as you watch down the road of this anime you'll find beloved happiness from it. learn new things and really find that there is more to life than meets the eyes as well as loved ones. i really recommend this anime to anyone who is going though some rough time or on the downside this really enjoyable!,10497,248,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love the characters. The story line jumps around a lot but it definitely keeps it interesting. Loved the sixth episode with the cat's back story.  The animation is okay for 2009 definitaly not Garden of Words but it is pretty good for it's time. Character are all very optimistic fun spirited and well rounded. Sound is pretty good the mouthing is a little off but after a few episodes you get used to it. Overall good show. ,10501,250,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh please give my life back… Like any other girl I’m no stranger to romantic animes. I even shed a tear during final episode of Bokura ga Ita but this was an absolute torture. To be fair I was forced to watch Clannad by my friend at the most inconvenient time ever – after I just finished gobbling up Attack on Titan.,10507,254,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The Clannad after story takes place after the oringinal Clannad and starts during the second semester at school. This shows the difficulties and challenges of everyday life as an adult. The story is so strong you will be crying towards the end of the show weather your a boy or girl. It is truly an anime of great stature and will be loved by anyone with a heart because this anime has a real emotional tie.,10509,255,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love this anime. It has everything any girls would want in it. Like the first one its very unexpected in a good way. A good anime is suppose to make you feel different feelings. This anime can sometimes make you laugh a lot or cry. Its a very active. The story line does jump a bit like randomly but stile keeps the peaces togheter. I would have liked to see more of the old classmate. This is sill one of my favoret anime. And I got to say this is one of the few anime that made my eyes cry not just a little but a lot in more then one time.,10520,260,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Oh my goodness I want to meet ONE person in this world that can watch both seasons of Clannad and not feel sad for the characters feel like crying or actually crying because I know I broke into tears five times through that anime but I must say I also laughed my face off. The characters are Amazing and its not every day that you find an anime where you get really attached to characters. To be truthful I started watching the first season of Clannad a while ago and after 3 episodes I dropped it because it was boring but then like any anime you have to get past the boring introduction so you can get to the good parts. Over all its a brilliant anime totally recommended.,10521,261,2019-04-13 21:35:40

'Clannad' is exceptionally difficult to review without *SPOILERS*,10526,264,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime I have to say is the most beautiful anime I have seen so far. It had me in tears it made me laugh. Basically the first season of Clannad gets you close to the characters. You get to know their personalities and start to love them. In Clannad After Story they use that to an advantage and pull the heartstrings. I would recommend this anime to anyone it is amazing. But of course watch the first season. The animation is really great one of the best I've seen. The characters are great as well they all have their own individual personalities. The sound is alright in the dub which I watched this from origionally it wasnt bad. Then I saw it subbed and it wasnt bad either. So overall this is a really amazing gorgeous anime.,10527,265,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Clannad After story (and its prequel Clannad) is an anime with love and lost comedy and sadness emotional ties and a slice of life. Clannad was an anime i ran into while searching for an anime no one told me about it i haven't heard of it and has not read about it. I am looking for an anime that could if emotional enough to make me cry. I never has encountered such an anime till now. I believe Clannad is by far one of thy best anime of this generation. Anyone that says that this anime sucks either likes violent animes with action and an extremely long runtime or you are mentally insane. Either way all in all Clannad was a touching anime and believe every true anime watcher most give this anime a try no matter what the circumstance is... unless someone has a gun to your head and says not to watch it then do not watch it cause no anime is worth your life for then you will never watch any anime EVER AGAIN!!!,10533,269,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,10534,270,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Clannad After Story is a direct continuation of the story of it’s predecessor. What could have been a half-assed cash in on the original actually turns out to be one of the best second seasons of an anime I’ve ever seen. While it does have points that it loses momentum and feels kind of like filler it tells three very distinct yet connected stories that really seems to work to it’s emotional advantage. It divides itself between high school dating marriage and adulthood. It really shows a progression that gives it the emotional charm that truly makes the show so successful.,10536,271,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A truly masterpiece anime that made me cry so many times. How beautiful but sad story. Specially the time Nagisa-chan and Ushio-kun died It was unbearable to watch. But the ending was surprising though. Well I don't want to spoil the story to those who has yet not seen it so please watch it. Or it will be a lifetime miss for you. ,10541,274,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"This is the only anime I know that can kill you nice and slowly multiple times and then resurrect you in the end. Beware there is much pain but without it you wouldn't be able to appreciate the goodness that accompanies it. This season is quite different from the first but the first connects nicely because the end wouldn't have such an impact without it given the ties of friendship Tomoya and Nagisa gathered in their past. The story is really a coming of age discovering that life will change and mostly out of control. However feelings are powerful miracles are possible and your dream can come true. Beautiful poignant and inspiring. ",10545,275,2019-04-13 21:35:40

clannad and clannad after story is probably my fav anime right now im not really into that love story and drama type stuff but when i watched clannad i was loving it the story gets u hook into it on the first couple of episodes and it just makes u want to forget about everything and just watch all the episodes this anime will seriously make u cry no matter how hard hearted you are if u watch and listen closely you will want to watch more thats similar to clannad,10562,282,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Clannad After Story is the 24 episode sequel to the much loved serious drama serious featuring quite a bit of comedy and ‘actual’ romance. I personally loved the original I took my time to watch it but I also know that some folks didn’t like how slice-of-life it was. I will say this sequel has significantly more plot progression in an episodic format and even passage of time something underused in anime IMO. Thus due to my enjoyment of the original I may be biased and the fact that I must give an overall score won’t help. So take my words and scores with consideration. Even though nothing much happened in the original series it was still able to invoke emotion and thought in me the viewer. I love it when an anime can do that in addition to simply entertaining.,10563,283,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Simply amazing and beautiful at times this nearly perfect anime left me in awe and tears that tormented me for the several weeks to come.,10564,284,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Without a doubt the most affecting anime I have yet watched. Strong characters often experiencing tough situations who behave in realistic often inconsistent ways are allowed to progress at a great pace. A beautiful series I look forward to revisiting in the future. I found myself equally hesitant and desirous of continuing after each episode especially halfway through the season. While the ending is perhaps a little too tidy and revisionist it fits the series and did put a smile on my face serving as a kind of wish fulfillment that I am sure many others shared. My only reservation in giving this a perfect 10 is a petty stubborness about giving something that so often hurt me such a score. I may have enjoyed other series more than this but the feelings it evoked during its run were definitely the strongest.,10568,285,2019-04-13 21:35:40
NOTE: This review was posted on a forum I am active on in a thread about anime. Parts of this review may be affected by that. This review was written on August 25 2010.,10570,286,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Intro...,10572,287,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Clannad was a pretty great show expertly adapted from what I assume is a pretty great game. It made me tear up a couple times but in general was just a good slice of life and school romance thing. After Story though.. Man. After Story starts out in somewhat familiar territory and then progressively gets more and more into the drama end of things. Basically if Clannad pulled at your heart strings then After Story rips out your heart Temple-of-Doom-style puts it back in for a second (but leaves the gaping chest wound) then pulls it out again then throws it on the ground stomps on it a few times picks it up and acts like it's going to put it back then drops it and stomps on it again then finally picks it up dirt and all shoves it back in surgically reattaches it and sews you up. It then looks at you saying  it's all better now right?  And no NO IT ISN'T AFTER STORY.,10573,288,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The anime is awesome I've watched the dubs and they're great! The story is great the animation for its time is fantastic no problems with sound infact I love their soundtract! The characters Lime Cherry and Bloodberry those three distinct characters are great emanating their own unique personalities. I would highly recommend this anime to anyone.,10586,295,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The world is dying. The world is dying and it's all the fault of a robot named Casshern. Casshern foolishly killed the sun that was named moon and after her death the ruin set into motion.

Well for the story for Casshern Sins it would best to say that the show starts off on a good note and becomes gets fairly interesting but then by the end you really wonder what it was all about.  To go into more detail it is as I said it starts out to be very interesting with the creators laying out an apocalyptic wasteland with everthing falling apart including a majority of the worlds citizens.  So for what reason is everything falling apart well that would be because the shows leading role Casshern killed the one called Luna and as a result the entire world is falling to ruin and of course our lonely hero is the only one unaffected by the ruin and can't remember anything about anything.  Does it sound interesting? Sure.  Would it have made for a rather good anime? Sure.  But did it? No.  So why might that this anime that should have had a good story fall short.  Well that would be because despite starting out good the main plot is for the most part completely abandoned until the last couple of episodes and in it's place we are left with a story that for each episode we get a new focus that is for the most part completely forgotten come the next episode.  Though of course that being said the one-shot episodes is actually where Casshern Sins is strongest in terms of story.  I for the most part would have been a lot happier with the story if it had either gone completely with the one-shot episodes instead of trying to squeeze some kind of main plot into the overall story or if it had stayed with one larger plot instead of several one-shot episodes.,10602,302,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't know if it's because I saw the korean movie  Antique Bakery  first but it was quite disappointing to me. I had expected a much more glamorous Yusuke Ono. Chikage tho I admit was a lot more interesting than I had first thought. But that's what happens when you see/read one thing and get expectations from it for the other.,10607,305,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Antique Bakery has a calm pace some pretty decent comedy and a nice dose of light drama. Full of bishies andellow colours the show was really easy on the eyes. The story started outeasonably light-hearted and slowly tilted a bit more towards dramall leading to a satisfying conclusion. An excellent show for aurprisingly wide audience: the bishie-fans fans of light-drama and thoseooking for something soothing.,10611,306,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"I loved this anime. It's based on one of my favourite maga. It's another one of those animes that you can show to an older friend. The plot is wonderful and you can get to love the charators. ",10620,307,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of the first anime I've seen handle homosexuality in a realistic way. Instead of being a flimsy excuse for pretty boys to be together it is actually shown in context within our society and is shown from many angles. The characters seem so real and the animation is beautiful. It is funny and beautiful all at the same time. I felt so satisfied by the end and just wish there was more of it.,10622,308,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Antique bakery was a very unique and funny anime the characters were so hilarious and the desserts looked amazing i dont know how i could explain all the comedy and even some serious parts in the series. i enjoyed Antique bakery very much and I think you should check it out too.,10623,309,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At the beginning of this anime the story seems like it will follow the run of the mill harem path. It does do that for awhile but I think that it deviated from that path as the series progressed.,10628,312,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The sequel of the great higurashi no naku koro ni. In this anime you'll get answers to the questions from from its prequel. It follows a strict storyline in contrast with higurashi no naku koro. It also flows better. When I finished watching I was left with a strong feeling of nostalgia.,10643,317,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When I first started watching Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni and later its second season Kai. I didn't know what to expect from it almost every source i heard of it from was different. Some sources claim it to be one of scariest and goriest anime they have ever laid eyes on others claim it to be halerious fanservice filled slice-of-life drama and yet others claim it to be one of the best mystery animes in recent years.,10647,318,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I felt that the first Higurashi series was excelent then I watched this one... I can't say enough good things about this one really...  one of the things that I liked about this one is that they didn't really change the format that they were using in the previous series but then again... why fix what isn't broken.,10648,319,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,10653,320,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For all the unanswered questions you get by the time you finish the first season you wonder if the second will answer them all. The answer is no but would there have been enough time to? In it's defense it answers quite a bit while providing backstory and motive as well as what's behind it all. It answers the main question and a few others while providing it's own and answering them in turn. It is Higurashi so more questions are to be expected.,10659,321,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is the second season of a well-known psychological thriller horror based upon a visual novel (available on Steam). Season 1 was the first anime to legitimately scare me not to say other anime of the genre are bad. But the thing that stood out about the original series and the major point of contention was the episodic nature and unexplained story. A mystery laid out yet never uncovered. In that respect this sequel is almost the complete opposite. It delves deep into the surprisingly rich backstory and the individual chapters are longer on average also being branched and having some form of continuation as these are more clearly connected. The trade-off however is less of the exciting psychological horror that made the first season popular. It might have been the fact that I watched most of this sequel during the day (and after moving no longer living alone) but there were very few occasions where this anime made me feel scared. I haven’t done a review of season 1 so I’ll discuss things like animation sound and characters here.,10679,326,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one I will never forget (mostly because I watched it in the dark) this gruesome anime is the one for you Horror lovers.As you can tell from the synopsis and other reviews this anime is centred around a curse (won't say too much) you'll know what it is before the second episode.,10681,327,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai is really just another entry into the long line of disappointing sequels. It doesn't hold up to the original series in any meaningful way and decides to go for a change in pace and tone that is so different from the first that I can't believe it was produced by the same group of people. ,10688,333,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can see how some people would have difficulty understanding the plot behind this anime without watching the video series it was based off - the Kagerou Project. Though adaptations are never perfect this one revolved around the assumption that the viewer had already seen the Kagepro videos. So to one who hasn't seen them the plot advances too quickly and has a few holes and to those who have it's missing a lot of content.,10690,335,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be honest this anime was great but at some parts during the anime i didnt know what was going on because each episode would just jump to a new character. I also thought that this anime would of been even better if they made the anime longer (1-24 episodes) it seemed like the anime was more rushed. The characters Animation voice actors and storyline were perfect a total 10/10 but again its a little confusing when jumping from place to place in every episode.,10691,336,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overall it was fun and the soundtrack is very cool the ending is cute and i recommend watching it.,10697,340,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Taking some years after the first season  Crest of the Stars .  The story once again follows the young pair of Lafiel who is now a captian of a ship and Jinto is an officer on that same ship.  Things take up a fairly quick pace right from the beginning as the main plot for the series mainly centers around Lafiel Shinto and the crew of the ship as they desperately try to survive the choatic battle that occurs throughout the series.  The animation has begun to show its age and while it may not always look all that great it isn't distracting enough to actually take anything from the series.  The opening and ending didn't really leave all that much of an impression with the opening being nothing more than some generic sounding orchestra piece and the ending not leaving much of an impression either.  The soundtrack throughout the series was actually fairly good.  It wasn't distracting enough to take you away from what was going on but it had enough of an presence that it helped to setup a good atmosphere.  The voice actors did there jobs good and had the tone to make the characters believable.  As for the characters the primary ones that the story tends to focus on is the development between Lafiel and Shinto.  And while the story never comes right out had have Lafiel and Shinto declare there feelings for each other by the end it becomes fairly obvious that the two have grown closer to each other.  Though still not quite to the level of pure romantic feelings.  As for the rest of the characters they all offer up something at will make certain aspects of them likeable but they all seem to take a back set to the main two characters.  Overall  Banner of the Stars  offers up a nice viewing experience that will satisfied anyone who has an itch for a good space opera.,10709,346,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It may be another MOE series but it has its treasures. It has a nice animation (the brightness is cute).,10716,352,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I enjoyed this anime but couldn't rate it any higher than what I gave it (especially with how frustrating some of its negative aspects presented themselves in later episodes).  Also I actually gave a rating on sound which was based off of the soundtrack (I saw the sub version and the voice acting was fine).  There was one episode which had an annoying high-pitched whistling in it to simulate a Western atmosphere but the whistling was so grating that I had to cover my ears; good thing for the subtitles! ,10717,353,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kyou Kara Maou is a good watch. I enjoyed it and I was smiling at the end. It's funny light-hearted and cheerful. It's a bit long counting 78 episodes of which a great deal are filler but in the end you can forgive that because the filler episodes aren't that bad - I was never bored. I mean it's the kind of anime you watch just for the fun of it if you want something more serious thought-provoking or intense this isn't your cup of tea.,10718,354,2019-04-13 21:35:40
God save the King indeed this series shows poor Yuri being flushed into another dimension and discovering he is the new demon king. Yes don’t worry youl understand after one episode.

This series is absolutly funny when from episode one its just like that did not just happen omg really seriously what in the world in a good way. So far i believe eventhough they basic story closely resembles others I believe this series is totally original in the comedy factor. I believe if you liked other anime like Special A Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge or princess princess you should really look into this one even though it is a semi long series you will be dying of laughter and really get into it,10721,357,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well  It has it's down sides and it's upsides  Vey liked the anime   the characters are quite interesting with their story . About the story  as some of the people sayed :   If you didn't watch the anime  most of it  wont make sense at all   And if you read the visual novel  then you wont find anything new .,10741,367,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Disclaimer here: if you have not played the visual novel OR watched the anime series I suggest you put this one off or otherwise subtract like 5 from the score I've given. To put it bluntly the movie expects and assumes that the viewer has some background knowledge of Fate/stay night's story. Most importantly knowledge of the first two nights of the story are vital in understanding what is going on. For the anime series this would encompass watching the first 3 episodes as the movie chooses to forsake all the early development stuff instead jumping straight to where the storyline branches off after a short introduction. That being said I still strongly encourage new viewers to watch the whole anime series before delving into the movie. The very nature of it being a movie leaves very little character development time for anyone besides our lead characters. That means other lesser characters though not by any means unimportant to the story will potentially look like random character additions which will likely take away from the viewer's enjoyment of the movie.,10742,368,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you're watching this season without watching at least the previous one then what the hell is wrong with you.  I was aggressively waiting after Part 1 finished because I hoped that they'd just go straight until it finished.  When it first came out I watched it ASAP.  However I was too exciting in the meantime and just read the manga instead.  Promise no spoilers.,10755,371,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is the first time I actually bothered to watch a special that wasn't full episode length and certainly the first time reviewing one. If you haven't seen the series there may be spoilers in here. There isn't much one can say about a 2 minute and 30 second video. The animation is slightly different mainly being it's use of darker colors.

First thing I can say is that there really are a LOT of episodes in this anime and if you don't have the time to watch it all I understand. If anything you could try the manga wich doesn't take all of that time to read even if it is longer. Also the first few episodes are not the best so I recommend watching up till the end of Arlong Park arc (episode 40 or so) to decide if you will continue or not.,10790,386,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was the first anime I completely saw through. I remember watching One Piece as a kid not really understanding much of the story line but instead enjoying the action packed fights it had to offer. ,10792,387,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,10793,388,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is such a good anime because it has a good story line to it but sometimes it has to many filler episodes to it but it is still good. I love most the characters of this anime because they are really awesome people but some of them I really hate. Also some of the characters have special powers and that is so cool but some of the powers are really weird. The animation of the anime was not so good at the beging of the it but as you go along in the anime the animation gets a lot better but don't me wrong it has good animation at the beging but not as good as the newier episodes. I like the sound of the anime because some of the characters of the anime have good voices and it also has good music in it but sometimes the music of the anime drowns out the voices.,10794,389,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Yes the number of episodes may be daunting but give it a try this anime is very good and has adventure. Fillers are hard to distinguish because they fit into the story and make it feel like a more relaxed part of the series for the most part; however some are noticable. character have good deveopement but its slower and more realistic. There are many emotions to be shared and adventure to be had. 700+ and the excitement is the same. This anime builds on itself and uses good history from previouse episodes later on and feels like an actual adventure. Its definatly worth trying and everyone has their own opinions so i hope you like it and its honestly my favorite anime so far. However not all arcs are magical; you will find characters and parts of this anime you dont like thats unavoidable for any anime you watch but over all story and plot is very good.,10798,392,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This series is crazy. A very weird . amazing  wild funny random and emotional serie  its  an adventure and friendship anime. The main character is 17 year old Monkey D. Luffy sets out on a journy to become the King of the Pirates  Just with this theme u can't predict what will be the anime   Monkey D.Luffy overwhelming confidence in himself and his friends and the craziest  dream which he has longed to fulfill since he was a kid . On his journey he meets many people and creatures and things word can't explain  friends and enemys for life. His funnies character of many animes .Crazy about food this naive boy loves get  himself and his friends into trouble constantly.,10799,393,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a very difficult review to write. First off One Piece is not yet completed next it is my best anime so i am biased towards this anime. But otherwise One Piece is just great. Basically One Piece is about a teenager called Luffy and his quest to become the pirate king and obtain the treasure called  One Piece . In order to do this he sets sail and enlists a series of crew mates. On his yourney so far Luffy has obtained 8 crew mates a new ship and many enemies. Each crew mate bring a new skill to the crew and some new story line. This anime is very cool and i would recommend it to anybody.,10800,394,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,10801,395,2019-04-13 21:35:40
there are many episodes to this anime but it is one of the best and has both an interesting and hilarious film. sometimes it will show flashbacks or go back to a different time but it has a great way of making you think hard about what has happened in the storyline earlier on. there are some hilarious characters and some may annoy you but there are so many in the team some cute some tough and some flirts too but no matter what they will not bore you. the adventures they go on are incredible and you would never think of any even in your wildest dreams. the songs at the beginning are good too and one of the videos to go with the sad song about what happened in the last few episodes (really late on in the storyline) that was really sad and all of it made me cry everytime.,10802,396,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ok So my first introduction to one piece did not go well I first watched the one which is dubbed by 4kids. which was tragic. plain and simple. so I spent the next decade or so thinking it was absoloutely awful and hated it without question. BUT THEN. along came a little birdy who convinced me to give it another try so I did and though I generally watched subs for some reason I decided to give the funimation dub a try. And I am now loath to say it was actually worth it. ,10819,405,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is my first review so it won't be long !!! This anime is my favourite because it's a wonderful story with very lovable characters heroes or villains alike and a lot of epic battles !! it has 700+ episodes so far but by the time you start you can't unglue your eyes from the screen !!! Have fun and enjoy the journey :D,10821,407,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One Piece is seriesreated by Eiichiro Oda and it is his only major work. It started to circulates a manga series in 1997 and it still ongoing. It currently has 58 volumes. In 1999 it was adapted to an anime series and just like the manga is ongoingurrently having 459 episodes. He created this series because of his love ofirates and Vikings. True story.,10822,408,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One Piece is a classic anime that has sold millions and will remain selling until it has finished. Eichiro Oda the creator of One Piece claimed that One Piece will continue for another 10 years. Its action scenesm dialog plot and charcters were substanderd for the first 30 episodes. When it reaches episode 50 it starts to improves and actually becomes a great anime.,10823,409,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you like naruto bleach and dragonball you will most likely like one piece too. Very long storyline pretty linear very interesting has its share of good guys who fall down hard but even so it's still an anime for kids and teenagers. In the end everything works out. And it has it's fair share of fillers and things that you might find irritating.,10824,410,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I Love this Anime and Have watched a great many episodes... But I cannot get enough of Luffy and his Crew! I love the Adventure and Comedy this anime exhibits. I love the diversity of lands enemies ability's and characters displayed throught the seemingly endless adventure of Monkey D. Luffy! If you are a fan of Adventure Fantasy or Long series I recommend this to you! As you go on with Luffy's adventure you'll find yourself captivated!So at least give it a try!,10834,414,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Synopsis,10842,416,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime lays it's best qualities in it's characters. It's kind of like filling a grey boring room with clowns talking about whatever you like talking about most. In other words while the story doesn't progress much and there is filler everywhere you look the characters are colorful and interesting beyond any other anime I have ever watched. Almost every character has an odd sometimes physics defying hair do that just screams originality and creativity. They will also have some kind of tic or defining characteristic that makes them not only interesting but lovable. That being said they can also be very annoying so it's a coin flip on which characters you'll enjoy. But I always want to get to the next arc to see what Oda has created next.,10845,417,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Where do I start from ? This anime is just too amazing every anime lovers should sit back and indulge this anime as it takes you to another dimension called ONE PIECE ; this is one of my all time best anime. Everything about it is amazing sure it started with less then impressive animations and characters however this anime started in 1999 contrdicting to that now this animes stroies is so grippingintense and intresting the animation got 100x better after 200 episodes and the characters have revitalized this master piece.This anime has elements of comedyadventureaction and a lot more. Sometimes it makes you cry and sometimes it makes you smile ; every episode is packed full of joy and amazingness.Only a handful of animes can emulate the greatness of ONE PIECEEEEEEEE!!!! TEE HEE !!!,10850,420,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm not going to lie if you want to watch this anime then you'll have to suck it up for the first 30 or so episodes. At first I dropped this anime because I thought this was the dumbest thing ever. I thought the powers plot and artwork were atrocious. I recently started watching this again and felt the same way at first. Then BAM!!!!! Out of nowhere this anime got epic. It was so good I couldn't stop watching it. I would stay up until 2 in the morning watching this my GPA dropped from a 4.0 to a 3.2 I've gained 20 lbs and I regret nothing. The story is so good you'll be sitting in your seat when the plot twist goes down and you'll be like  HOT DAMN!!!  and  WTF?  You never know what is going to happen next. One thing I had a problem with was the artwork but after a while you'll get used to it and the artwork gets better. If you are on the fence about watching this or were like me and stopped watching it then pick up that ipad or computer and get watching now.,10852,422,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One Piece follows the story of Monkey D. Luffy trying to become the pirate king and going through adventures in order to fulfill this goal.,10855,423,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime. This anime has a really good story line to it. I like that the main characters all have one main goal to reach but what I do not like about this anime some times is that it has to many filler episodes. But I sitll like the story line. I like the animation that is in the newer episodes of One Piece. Also I like watching the animation of this anime grow over time and develop more. I like most of the music through out the anime because most of them do not drown out the characters voices but you can get that one song that does that. I also love some of the opening and closing songs. Most of the characters in this anime are so flippn' awesome I just wish that they were real. But there are some characters in this anime that I wish would just die a very painful death. Overall this is a really awesome anime.,10856,424,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really like the Anime Overall.,10859,425,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Have you ever been really into an anime then they come out with a filler episode? It's kinda dissapointing at first but then they get back to the storyline. That was almost my experience with Orphen: Revenge. I really enjoyed the first series but then I started watching Revenge expecting it to be at least as good and I was extremely dissapointed. There are 11 episodes of filler before the storyline even begins to develop. Seriously just skip the first 11 episodes and this will be a better anime. Unless you're into just watching Cleao go on multiple shopping sprees without any kind of storyline you should just skip this series altogether. I have never been so dissapointed with an anime in all of my life.,10870,429,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sky Girls was very light-hearted feel-good anime that left a smile on my face at the end ofearly every episode. The interactions between the three main characters andheir antics made this series a lot of fun to watch. Otoha was the quirkyomboy. Karen was the introvert brainiac. Eika was the serious disciplinarian.nd later on they're joined by Elise the sharp-tongued tsundere. The storyhat went along with the character dynamics was also very well-done: it was acifi post-apocalyptic alien-invasion sort of tale with some interestingwists.,10882,430,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I think of this as being like Evangelion Light meets Charlie's Angels. 3 young girls are purposely sought out to pilot a prototype military mech and experience the trials of bonding training and earning the respect of their ranking superiors.,10884,431,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I loved inu x boku. The characters weren't all original but they were used in a way that was still interesting and entertaining. Honestly the end result I saw coming but there were some things I didn’t expect. The one character there for purely comedic relief made me want to barf or kill him I prefer to take option two into consideration but other than the pervert who assumed everything not just everyone but everything on the planet was either a sadist or a masochist annoyed me to no end but everyone else I know thought he was hilarious. That was the only thing that turned me off this anime but since he showed up far and few between I got through it all just fine. The happy ending almost made me cry it was so sweet. (I'm a sap for a happy ending what can I say) I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a very devoted guy make a very distrustful girl realize love can last. ",10920,446,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I loved this anime but what irked me is that there will not be a second season that this anime deserves. The weak point is that the whole story is a prologue to a bigger plot that is revealed in the manga and that is why it might feel uneventful and dull at times. Overall it was a nice anime with great potential if the story was expanded somewhat. ,10937,454,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime was just alright up until episode 10 and 11. It delves deeper into the background of the male protagonist/love interest named Soushi Miketsukami. Because of this episode 11 is probably the most interesting part of the whole thing and it's a shame that it took so long to get there only for it to end in the next episode. The last episode leaves you feeling like it's not quite finished. It seems abrupt and you're left wanting more even though it's a nice ending. I found out that there is the DVD Special which is a collection of three shorts and they were more fun than the whole anime. I feel like this had potential for more. (It felt like a combination of Kamisama Hajimemashita and Black Butler but nowhere near as good as those two.) Still enjoyable enough to watch when you have the time. Wish it had a season 2! I give it an overall 6/10 and 3 out of 5 stars.,10943,457,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I absolutely loved this anime! It was fantabulous in fact! The story was beautiful focusing on not only the two main characters but the supporting cast as well. And considering this was a love story there was just enough of the supernatural element in my opinion. Also the different ending songs for the various different characters was a particularly nice touch! ,10949,461,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime really blew me away. I wasn't sure what to expect from it. I was sad at points shocked at others and the ending leaves you feeling sad and happy at the same time.

Shinsekai Yori deserves a positive review. I must say that at the beginning it is confusing and slow-paced with many scenes that I thought were quite unnecessary. But if you stick with it soon enough a plot starts to emerge and it gets really captivating. ,10989,471,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Watching this anime was a blast. The show itself is a biography of the MC Saki which wasnt obvious in the beginning. I was a bit bummed when the time leaped on at first but it turned out good. The animation is very inconsistent while mostly average it can dip down to almost disturbingly bad. It felt as if there were a few filler episodes in the middle parts of this 25ep story as the pacing slowed down and I felt a bit like I wanted to stop watching but pulling through with it paid off. Past the middle the show catches wind like a typhoon was going on.,10995,472,2019-04-13 21:35:40
From The New World is a unique take on the post-apocalyptic theme. It takes place far in humanities future during a time when humans have evolved to possess psychokinetic powers.

This is one of those animes were panty-shots and ecchi content are more prevalent than the actual plot.,11083,494,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,11087,495,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Agent Aika has a mediocre premise of enhanced abilities and semi-spy antics. Some of the characters like Aika herself are actually quite charming but most of the others range from boring to annoying to just plain weird. Not weird in the good way either. The animation is actually quite good and Aika is very hot (both transformed and untransformed) if you are into animated girls. Admit it you are. But the thing that really bugged me more than anything else in this series:,11093,496,2019-04-13 21:35:40

... and here is where the studio chickened out.,11099,499,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well these eps were part of the actual ending to the series right? Btw this is probably a SPOILER if anything. But it was great till the ending which in my opinion was extremely fucking frustrating. honestly to have all this built up emotion about those 2 and just having it end like nothing happen is frustrating. i know why it ended like that i read that apparently to save face of the animation company they would deny a full incest ending but in my mind kyousuke and kirino are just forever together. this is more like a mini rant then a review haha sorry. anywho it was a good story im just put off by the ending is all.,11101,500,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I hate to give anything high rating as I'm always sure to find something better. However Chrono Crusade has earned its place amongst my most favorited animes. The story is set in the 1920's. Demons threaten the new piece achieved after World War I. The organization known as The Magdalene Order intervenes and exorcises demons. The story focuses on Rosette and her friend Chrono.,11111,502,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ages ago the fallen angels of Pandemonium lead by the demon Aion revolt in an effort to be free of their Divine punishment. Labeled by hell as “sinners” they attempt the impossible: to fight their way back into heaven. Humanity is largely unaware of this age old struggle save the Magdalene Order an organization who trains it’s members for the purpose of battling against Aion and his minions.,11113,503,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I should start this with a disclaimer: I'm a big big fan of the manga. So naturally when I went to watch the anime I wasn't able to fully divorce myself from the original source. While I normally try to approach different versions based on their own merits and indeed I've loved anime that deviates a lot from its original source material (like Fullmetal Alchemist) in this case I think this series fails as an adaptation--and by lessening what made the original manga so great in the first place damages the series as a result.,11177,508,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I first watched a couple episodes of this a while back and didn't take interest in it but recently decided to watch it through on some recommendations and still found it to not be of my interest.  I find the character dull and cliche and in general the pacing is slow with unexciting action scenes.  The story is somewhat unique and neat but just not very detailed and sometimes just seems random or lame. The animation is decent but by no means eye-candy. The ending was a big flop total disappointment since I was hoping for some awesome fight or anything to make watching all of that worth while.  I had to force myself to watch this and I regret it now I should have stuck with  dropped .,11179,509,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Once a proud demon forced to cut off the head of Pandomonium refusing to continue the ruthless battle of the heavens and deciding good his horn is removed. Now Chrono remains in a childlike state his lifeforce controlled by Rosetta of the Magdolin order. The fight to keep evil at bay. This series is another top 10er folks it has action intrigue and its just a fun watch look out for the ending u'll cry,11185,510,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,11189,511,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A very relatively good anime. Loved the plot that it was going for. However I just could not deal with Rosette's voice. It was kind've a nuisance and I couldn't stand hearing it in the beginning. Eventually I got used to it. But despite that I really enjoyed this anime and loved all of the action and craziness that happened in it. ,11197,512,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,11209,514,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I enjoyed the beginning of this anime a lot. Sadly though I started to lose interest towards the end of the anime as it grew to make very little sense.,11213,515,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Based on 1.5 Episodes Watched,11221,516,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just a thought but how did the main character become a minor character.. The first season wasnt so bad but im just lost as to why you would do that...,11227,517,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ookami Kakushi was written by Ryukishi07 best known for Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. That should pretty much tell you what to expect since Ookami Kakushi is an obvious shameless clone of its considerably superior ancestor.,11237,519,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So another one of my reviews this time for Ookami Kakushi.....so this was an anime that I watched for the monthly marathon on the forum and to put it bluntly it was pretty average. The basic story reminded me of a story/arc maybe in Gosick with the theme of Pandora Hearts but it was to be honest all over the place. The storywell it wasn't great and to be honest I wouldn't class it as a horror but I managed to get through it.,11239,520,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What a terrible show. It had some potential at the beginning but itust got worse from there. It was not scary or even a little creepy. Itas just stupid. By the time the show was over I was asking myself that was it?  They knew nothing about pacing. The show ended but thenhere was still one more episode. Of course it had nothing to do withhe story. Why? What's the point? It's like they inserted filler buthere is nothing left to  fill . It was just stupid.,11241,521,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Being the type that has to finish anything I start I grinded my self through this one. I have yet to watch an anime to make me quit before finishing.... Anyways.....,11245,522,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"When I first started watching this show I was excited I loved the Higurashi and Umineko series and hoped this one would be similiar as far as the excitement factor went because as the show progressed it seemed to build and develop in a similar fashion promising some exciting twists and turns.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  ",11266,524,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well.. The last two episode of Shakugan no Shana S is actually my favourite episode of the whole series.,11268,525,2019-04-13 21:35:40

 Despite being a short ova boasting only four episodes Shakugan no Shana S was able to move me and affect me. I may be rambling on because of my personal like of the ova but I believe that this ova is worth watching even if you have not watched Shakugan no Shana before hand as it doesn't spoil the main plot and is self explainitory (only in the 3rd and 4th eps though). The leading two eps are more like filler eps in a long anime or show that pop up but make for a sweet watch (if you watched the origanal or not doesn' t matter too much),11275,527,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora is a 6 episode romance anime set in a hospital. At first glance this appears to be touching gentle story about a potentially tragic romance. However it wasn't the tear-jerking anime I expected and not necessarily because of the story but a good deal due to the characters. Is this worth the 2.5 hours it takes to watch? Credits are also story spoilers so leave them out until the last episode.,11313,532,2019-04-13 21:35:40

-Story-he Story in The Sky Crawlers is a complex one and it can be hard to follow at times but thats what makes it a good story. It explores some of the deepest parts of the human experience and it makes you think. The concept itself is preey good too and the idea of corperate warfare seems like it could actually happen one day. The Kildren provide a decent perspective of the human experience so that we can explore it from a whole new light. However If you are into lots of action then this is not the movie for you. This movie will bore people who demand constant action. The Sky Crawlers has a lot of quiet moments in it and it really requires the audience to focus on the little details that are revealed as the story progresses. This movie is detail oriented and may require several viewing to see and understand all of the little details that show up through out the film. All in all the story is amazing and makes this movie well worth seeing.,11359,540,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a really excellent anime.  I went into it basically on a whim -- I couldn't tell you why it got shuttled to the top of my Netflix queue over anything else -- based more or less on an action-packed trailer and what I got was a surprisingly mature engrossing and sedate film that raises some very interesting questions.,11385,543,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,11389,544,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The begining was great with Macha Green and her rival but when the showed became about her sister I dropped interest. I finsished to see if it would make a turn which it did at the end. The whole purpose of the story was unclear and made it hard to follow. I don't want to spoil anything but I was under impressed. It would be like watching Kill la Kill or Gurren Laggan then swithcing over to watch K-on.,11405,545,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was one I wasnt sure off at the start but after watching the first episode with over the top action and some comedy mixed in I fell in love with this anime and its become one of my favourite of the season. The downside side is towards the end I got lost at what was happening but since the anime has great characters introduced all the way though I can forgive that. I highly reccomend this anime to people who just want a fun anime that isnt serious and will bring a few tears at the end.,11411,546,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,11421,547,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What I love most about this anime is the characters. They develop they grow they learn and they fall in love. They don’t meet and know they are destined to be together and know its love at first sight. They work at it and slowly but surely fall in love. It isn't fan service it isn't instantaneous and it isn't perverted. It's sweet its slow its practical! It's realistic because it's not a fairy tale whirlwind romance. The music is amazing and suits the anime. The songs make me feel all tingly inside. It's got that feel that if it were a real life story it'd be used as an inspirational love can overcome all stories that girls watch after breakups and on their periods (I'm just calling it as I see it sorry if it disturbs you). I fell in love with this anime so much I've watched it multiple times and try to force it on others too lol. It's any age appropriate so if you babysit you can watch it in front of kids and they will enjoy the music and you don’t have to worry about them being traumatized (yes I speak from experience). All in all a must see.,11433,548,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,11441,549,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely loved this anime. The charcters were all lovable and relatable (in my opinion). The animation was wonderful and the songs got stuck in my head all the time. I loved the storyline and the developing love between Nike and Livius. ,11445,550,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Soredemo Sekai wa Utuskushii is based on two main characters Nike-hime and Livius I the Sun King. After losing a game of rock paper scissors to her 3 sisters Nike is placed on a ship to the faraway sun kingdom to be married. The story follows the journey of Nike and Livi and their marriage.,11447,551,2019-04-13 21:35:40
(68.55%) PRETTY AVERAGE:,11457,552,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushiii otherwise known as This World is Still Beautiful is a surprisingly delightful treat.  Looking at the synosis it looks like a standard tale of boy meets girl with the boy being a jerk.  It looks like pretty standard anime romance fair.  And for the most part....it is.  However it is the standard romance done right.  In many shojo romances i've found myself frustrated by the sheer stupidity of the main characters at times.  In some anime romances problems and issues happen for petty reasons and the main characters take actions that are equally as petty. In this anime however we have excellent character development with a romance formula that is not often used.,11465,553,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It was painfully beautiful! If you love sweet love stories and royalty this is just as Princess Sissi and France or Qween Maria of Romania and King Ferdinand. It's an arranged marriage doesn't look good at all at first. He's too young she's all more than a teenager the difference is way too big. Still feelings and behaviour usually don't have age. They just flow in the air and hit whenever they find a crack in your heart. That's what happens here. I still wanted a different ending just as Livius said once:  I'm not about to stay this small I still have to grow. You'll be able to dance with me in no time . I wish I could have the chance to see Livius as a grown up.,11467,554,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's been a long time since I've watched any anime. I never really got into it too hardcore but the other day I was just kind of in the mood and found this. By the second episode I was hooked. I finished it within 2 days! Would have been one if only I didn't have to work ~sigh. Anyhow this anime was a hit with me. Not a single miss! I love it! It has a great storyline with a nice romance that you can actually see develop. None of the characters are annoying and it's not quite as silly as some of the other anime but has a perfect amount of comedic relief. I would love if they stepped up the action just a bit but it still had enough to keep me satisfied. If only I could find some more anime like this! The artwork is stunning. I'm still singing the song in my head. This NEEDS a second season. I NEED closure for this anime. ,11469,555,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Background-In the late 1980's the world's polar ice caps are melting due to global warming and thus causing water level to increase. With the threat of water levels rising to coastal areas like Tokyo they started the Babylon project in the early 1990's. The Babylon project is a plan to build a barrier to prevent the sea from taking the land. But thanks to the rapidly development of hyper-technology a humanoid machine called “LABOR” is being used to help project Babylon and in almost every field of the industry. Howeverit has also created the new social menace of “LABOR” crime. In order to curb such crimes from happening one after another the Metropolitan Police Department has established a special department the “Special Vehicle Section no.2”. It consists of a company of patrol “LABOR” known as PATLABOR.,11471,556,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Watching this anime was the best. The characters voices in the dub were so funny I was laughing the entire episode after the first season; however it switched to sub. Normally this would be good because sub is the way to go; however the characters voices were other people's voices and weren't as funny.-Still everything else makes up for it and you don't have to watch after season one. They could've stopped there and most people would be happy-but unfortunately they stopped dubbing. 4Kids you've messed up for the last time prepare for waffles.,11531,568,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There is alot to like about this series.  If you put aside the over the top way over used harem cliche and a few other repetitive anime rehashes at least.  Most of the characters are likeable.  It is a bit confusing that even enemies of Zero treat him better than the person he is supposed to be in love with and that loves him.  This obviously means that he must be some kind of masochist but has yet to admit it or realize it.  If the show did reveal him to be a true masochist a bit more clearly it might not seem as weird that he likes the worst character in the entire story and the one to dislike the most.  Every now and then I might seem some vague hint that she isn't just some selfish self centered egotistical overly jealous dominatrix-like abusive sadistic and complete biatch but that is rare.  She spends so much time either verbally abusing Zero or beating him or starving him or other wise mistreating him that it almost takes over the story as if that was all the story was about but you do get glimpses of the story beyond that like the war and intrigues in the court.  It is no doubt the person who likes him most is either the maid or the princess and they both treat him 100 times better than the ill mannered brat known as Louise.  She is a character I love to hate and probably the most dispicable main good guy character in any anime ever made which is pretty bad because her nastiness surpasses all the idiotic perverts and letches so often seen in anime as good guy characters but they don't usually spend as much time abusing their so called friends or using them as tools.  There is honestly very little to like about Louise sure she is cute and small and sometimes acts like a cute spoiled brat but her status takes her hissy fits over the top because Zero is always the but of her anger.,11537,570,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of the higher rated and hyped anime that I've been meaning to watch.

Now I have always disliked tsunderes. In my opinion tsunderes have rarely ever if not never been done right. This anime is no exception. I suggest building up a MASSIVE tolerance to stupid annoying non-plot related bullcrap before watching this anime. Now my opinion is definitely biased due to my intolerance of tsunderes but this anime leaves me aghast. I've tried many times to pick it back up however I keep finding myself disgusted at the characters. Starting with the main character (which by the way is the only reason the character rating is not 0/10) he is a wimpy as hell harem leader. Average stuff ok. HOWEVER he does get stronger and becomes a respectable guy. Now onto the Tsundere WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL. She is the most annoying most up herself most disgusting little girl I have ever seen in my anime viewing history. I am afraid that I will start ranting if I talk about this anime any longer so I'm going to cut myself short here. BASICALLY. Do NOT watch this anime if you cannot stand annoying tsunderes. DO watch this anime IF you love tsunderes and fantasy stories. ,11597,584,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,11609,585,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Louise is a student at a Harry Potter-like school for magic on aistant world. She is known as  Louise the Zero  because of heronsistent failures in the magical arts. During one exam she summons Hiragiaito an average Japanese student as her familiar. This was a really enjoyableeries with classical tsundere-boy tensions love triangles politicalntrigue and fantasy action-adventure.,11625,589,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show. No matter how much I write I will never be able to describe how much I love it. Louise being a Tsundere made the show so good. Her's and Saito's reationship went at a steady pace which I personally enjoyed. Siesta I hated(still do to this day) I would shout at my screen telling her that Saito loves Louise. The way Saito attracted most girls would get annoying sometimes. This show I managed to watch 3-4ish days/nights and honestly it's one of the best animes I've ever watched. It would either make a 1 or 2 on my top animes. This show always gives me feels when I watch it. It makes me feel happy and honestly its one of the most enjoyable shows out there for me. ,11633,590,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Zero no Tsukaima is a very good anime. It blends Ecchi with Action very nicely. I enjoyed whenever  unusual  (trying not to spoil it) weapons were used in the seires. As well I think the episodes had a nice flow and nothing was too abruptly introduced. I also enjoyed the Comedy that was presented throughout the series.,11635,591,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,11659,592,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Let me start by saying that I read the manga before I watched the anime so I went into watching it knowing the anime was unfinished. That said I still had some pretty major issues with the story. Spoilers lie ahead. Be warned.,11663,594,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Saiunkoku is the worst type of anime- it's not so obviously bad that you stop watching it right away but rather that you get pretty far into it so you want to see how it all ends while at the same time just wanting it to be done so you can delete it from your computer and free up 10 gb.  At the end of this 78 episode long series (including the first season) that's pretty much all I was thinking.  I dont regret watching it but I dodn't exactly enjoy it that much. ,11665,595,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I like this anime a lot.My favorite thing about it is the boysall good looking.Hihara is the one I like the most.The one I like the least is the flute player.Anywaysback to the story.This anime was full of drama and romancewhich I look for in an anime.If you love romance I suggest you watch La Corda D'oro (the bond of gold).,11679,597,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had started this anime a while back but never finished it because every time I played a certain episode it was freeze so I stopped trying and moved on. But then I thought about it and decided I'd try again. I started over not really remembering which episode I was on. And this is only the second day that I've watching and I'm already done with. Anyway I have been ingulfed with the music and the story line. (I kinda have this thing about fearies :D). But I have to say that I will never be able to watch this anime in english because the original is just too good!,11689,601,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is hilarious.  Especially Nodame and Chiaki together.  I haven't finished the anime yet but I love it.  What also gets me going is the outro music.  I sing a long...badly but I'll get used to the Japanese soon enough.  I got the first part pretty well.  I love it!,11697,605,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,11705,609,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I will admit that at first Nodame Cantabile wasn't going to be something that I was going to enjoy all that much.  I mean sure it had been getting a lot of hype at the time but every time I even considered watching it just looking at the screenshots or reading the synopsis it would always just turn me off and I would end up watching something else.  So when I decide to just endure it and began watching the first episode you can imagine my surprise when it turns out to not be as bad as I thought it was going to be and in fact I was finding it to be highly entertaining.  Needless to say that after my intial surprise I soon found myself unable to stop watching and before I knew it I had finised the entire thing.,11711,610,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Lete preface by saying this is one of the best anime series I've seen.  Inticipated good things considering the comments and reviews I'd readut I had no idea how much I'd really enjoy it even though I'm notarticularly a fan of either the piano or classical music (I doppreciate both but I'm not the type to go buy a cd or something).,11713,611,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There is nothing special about this except it's a series of short stories around 4-5 mins long loaded with standard ecchi fanservice overall it's more of an even more ludicrous amount of  shut off your brain  moment than the main series.,11731,615,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As a fellow piano player and anime watcher at first i just want  change of pace after watching too many action shounen anime so i ended up watching Shigatsu Wa Kimi no Uso (well they did have the romance music tag). I got addicted to the beautiful classical piano music at first then at the same time the romance between our protagonists. I thought it will just be like any other typical romance anime but HELL NO it was a lot deeper than i thought.,11733,616,2019-04-13 21:35:40
F this anime.... and before you get the wrong idea I loved it. This anime was a wonderfull example of characture development and a looming conflict that (granted could be spotted from a mile away) puts the watcher in a 3rd person point of view of the conflict resolution. We are allways made conscientious of what is 'going' to happen and it builds our expectation for the ending. This anime I've got to say did a very good job of interweaving all these complext emotions towards supporting charactures from the protagonist and giving it 'colour' through music. It then will overflow you with emotion when the main conveys everything thats happened so far what he hopes and what conviction he takes through his preformance in the end. If you dont mind classical music and love drama and romance this is most definitly for you.,11735,617,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After Nodame Cantabile I didn't think I'd be able to find another music-related anime that would catch my attention as much. I was wrong.,11737,618,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've watched this anime since it started and believe me I wasn't the type to watch music-related-drama-anime cause I thought it's only going to be boring and such but dang!! This anime is different! The animation is good! The characters blend well! And man telling you all about feels! I just can't handle it esp. when the anime was on the verge of twisting the story line! I restrain myself from reading the manga cause I knew it would ruin my expectations and predictions when I was following the story on anime!! it was worth to wait every week!! just the down-side to this anime is the last episode which is kinda sad cause there were a lot of missing scenes (I read the manga after the anime finishes) there should be a part where Kousie cry or whatever at the end and there should be a result from the competition! I felt the last episode was kinda rush but overall the ending was very satisfying. So give it a 10/10 cause this anime really gives the chills satisfaction some comedy and feeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllsss!! ,11739,619,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched this after my fiance recommended it. Im not a big fan of lachrymose drama so it has to be special in some way to get a chance.,11741,620,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A very sincere above average drama/romance series revolving around two leads with tragic pasts and a love of music.,11747,623,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Summary,11749,624,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you like romance / slice of lice anime this is a really good watch. I had an inkling this would be good so I faithfully downloaded the episodes every week for months and months and then after episode 22 finally came out I marathoned it in 2 days. I just love it when an anime does that to me :-) And at the end I was crying like a baby. It's one of those anime where they manage to put together a good plot with good characters good animation and good music. ,11751,625,2019-04-13 21:35:40
SPOILER ALERT...read at your own risk.,11755,626,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't have word's to describe this all i know is that after i watched first episode i couldn't stop until last episode the emotions that you feel i don't think i saw in other anime series at least not at this level the story is not quite unique but is very good the sound is umbelieveble im open to try other genre of music and i learned that i quite like the combination of piano and violin. The last episode was surprised me it was a happy ending but at the same time a very sad in my opinion. All that put together made this anime series a must watch for me and for sure i will re-watch it in the future.,11757,627,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Perfect. Just Perfect.,11759,628,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm like to make my reviews short and to the point so to start off you will cry. I'm don't care is you are the most heartless basted in the world you will cry so for all of these who don't want to deal with the emotional overload don't watch this anime.,11761,629,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wish there had been more focus on Takeshi and Emi but besides that it was such a lovely story which even when you could predict the end it was presented in such a beautiful way.,11763,630,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Este anime de tooodos los que he visto no dudaría en llamarlo el mejor me encantó todo los personajes la música la historia sobre todo (aunque el final me dio pena). Después de ver el anime estuve varios días deprimido no quería que terminase y buscaba por una OVA o una ''Seasson 2'' pero bueno aún nadie sabe nada solo de la OVA me alegro MUCHO.,11767,631,2019-04-13 21:35:40
WOW!! This anime is amazing jumping to one of my top favs in just the first few episodes!! The characters werereally fleshed out and lovable and the relationships between the characters real and believable (Except for Watari...he kinda was just...there most of the time)...,11769,632,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If I really had liked this anime; it isn't because of the ending; as most of the people say but because of its beginning. If I had to describe it it really showed a happy and optimistic view of life in contrast with all the disgraces that the main character passed through (What a cliché!).,11771,633,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I can not say enough about this anime. From the first episode to the last this story has you hooked and on a rollercoaster of emotional expierences. Not one character are you able of hating you will find one whom at first you despise but in the end this show is nothing but pure and unconditional love! I highly reccommend this anime!,11773,634,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,11777,635,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm not one for well articulated reviews. I have the worst time putting into words the things I feel for certain anime it's ridiculous. This is one of those. I just can not stress how incredible this anime is. From it's beautiful art to the INCREDIBLE character development and even the wonderful music that's played throughout. As someone who asbolutely loves the piano and classical music this show brings me to tears consistently. Every episode is full of meaning love passion. Anime like this are the reason I've watched for well over a decade and a half. Anime like this touch your soul. They speak to you they bring out your inner most emotions through it's story characters music everything. I am not looking forward to it's end but alas it is inevitable and I can only imagine what it's going to be like. I dread it I look forward to it we shall see.,11783,636,2019-04-13 21:35:40
STORY:,11785,637,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was the best anime (and manga) of its category that I've seen. I loved the story and I thought that it was executed masterfully in a way that makes you feel like any more or any less would ruin the story. ,11787,638,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't really know why I started to watch this anime... But it was the only one that caught my attention since the very first moment of the very first episode. It is just sad and beautiful at the same time.,11789,639,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Every single thing story/animation/sound characters comes together to make this my favourite anime of 2014 the way it deals with some very tough emotional scars that the characters deal with to way they express their emotions is fantastic every episode has had me gripped since day one and the music they have in this is magical i cant praise it enough please watch this masterpiece of an anime,11791,640,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso o Your Lie in April (El nombre no me ha motivado de ninguna manera el verlo en Abril fue mera coincidencia jaja) es un Drama/Musical que contiene una buena parte musical y un drama no tan bueno. La historia va más o menos así: Tenemos a nuestro prota Kousei Arima el cual es un niño prodigio que por motivos de la vida pierde a su madre esto provocara sumando a un padre en su totalidad ausente que Kousei se hunda en una profunda depresión provocándole así una incapacidad para escuchar las notas del piano. Shigatsu intenta contar un drama conmovedor fallando vilmente al tener que apoyarse en la mayoría de las típicas situaciones que podemos encontrar en cualquier otro drama restándole así frescura y originalidad a la obra (No es que odie completamente los clichés es solo que ver tantos juntos duele). Otro punto negativo es la tontería de haber alargado una historia que perfectamente pudo haber sido narrada en 14 capítulos y no en 22. No quiero que se confundan el que cuente con 22 capítulos no la convierte en una serie pesada de mirar al contrario no recuerdo nunca haberme encontrado en una situación en la que quisiera que el capítulo terminara pronto o que se me hiciera muy largo pues dicha historia esta hábilmente narrada con introducción de personajes nuevos y un poco de trasfondo para darle más cuerpo a la historia principal; plus tendremos bastantes momentos cómicos evitando que la obra caiga en un melodrama infumable.,11793,641,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this is one of the most amazing anime i have seen since naruto started. At first i did not think that i would like a music based anime but i decided to start this one becuase the art looked so beautidul. I quickley got into it and now LOVE this. Everything about it is perfect from the music to the plot to the characters. There is no flaw to this anime the only down side to this anime is that it is very hard to find the manga translated into enlgish in a book. SO the only way to find out what happends is by watching the anime. If anyone knows where to find an english translated manga of this anime PLEASE notify me and i will be ethernaly greatful. Anyway i just wanted to write a review because i was slighltey mostified that no one had written a review for such a beautiful and well done anime. 10 all around no complatint except for not having an english translated manga and having the episodes end at the most suspensful time.,11795,642,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Normally I don't write reviews. This anime is the one I like to make an exception for. Please don’t mind my English. It’s not my native language and it’s now like half passed three in the morning so I’m pretty much too tired to write this but I try my best to make a good review of this awesome anime. [No I can’t go to sleep before I’m finished with this xD],11799,643,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of the few animes that really touched and moved me. It really shows you how life can be cruel but also how beautiful it can become. The story the characters everything makes this anime a masterpiece. Its poetry and its beauty not only come with the beautiful animation and sceneries this anime brings but also with its amazing musics. You will probably remember this anime for a long time and I'm not scared to say this anime can really bring you peace. ,11807,644,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The character development and the way this series gets you feeling is just incredible. It's an incredible emotional rollercoaster that you should be more than happy to ride. It's captivation and beautiful I reccomend to anyone with a love of music anime and romance.,11809,645,2019-04-13 21:35:40
why.....are my eyes raining.,11813,646,2019-04-13 21:35:40
overall this anime is very good. i do not like the way it is drawn and i dont really understand classical music. the overall story i did like and there was  a lot of feels at the very end. did not like the ending very much but ill live. love story was very dull at best.,11815,647,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is an unvarnished look at not only the tragedy of having lost someone but also the slow agonizing process of having someone you love wasting away and being helpless to do anything about it. It examines the people they leave behind and the constant struggle between what was and what might have been. Its a story that's been told a thousand times but also one that cuts so deep because it's so real.,11835,651,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,11837,652,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I kind of forgot how I came across this.  I probably found out about this anime on this website.  It took me a while to finish this because I was busy with school.  I only just finished watching the show a few moments before writing this review.,11841,653,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This story was heartfelt and left me in tears.My heart hurted after watching this. But it was pretty interesting. The storys development was also very interesting. All in watch this and i guaranty you'll be left  in tears mourning.,11843,654,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A piano prodigy named Arima Kousei lost his ability to play piano after his mother's death.He then met a girl who brought color to his life. Her name was Miyazono Kaori. This is one of the love triangles that end up.... you know. All the characters are fun so don't hate them for the love triangle. Besides those classical music they played the OST were emotional and touching as well. The story was more emotional. Along with the music the anime is one heck of a rollercoaster. Through love Arima was able break the chains that shackled his music career. I never thought I'd be able to shed tears for an anime. This was a first.,11855,656,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the first anime and the last four or five years to evoke an emotional response it can be slow going at first but it has music story and an ending there is no second season (or at least there shouldn't be).  it is a complete anime and worth watching.,11857,657,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm now officially broken thanks to this masterpiece!,11859,658,2019-04-13 21:35:40
going into this show i didnt really know what to expect id heard nothing but good things about it but at the same time i really dont care about classical music. Most of the story does center around tghe character and relationships between them and how the music as a whole effects those relationships but i really began to fall in love with the music the more the series went on and the characters made it that much more enjoyable because you could start to understand why they love the music tghey play and the hesitations they have to overcome in order to play at their best btw bring some tissues when you get towards the end your gonna need them.,11867,659,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really good anime. It really hit the feels with all its might. splendid music. I liked how the characters evolved through out the story.  ,11869,660,2019-04-13 21:35:40
" ",11873,661,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show blew my expectaions of a show away and thursdays wont be the same without this impactful show. At the beggining it starts off as a bright and colorful show that made me just fall in love with each and every character. As the show progressed it became brighter and brighter and when it hit a peak of hapiness it spirals you back down with such emotions that will make you want to keep watching till the very end. The ending will break you at the beggining and build you back up again. The show is a emotional rollar coaster and i suggest this show to anyone.,11879,662,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I can't say I like this series. The storyline was cliched and you already know what is going to happen halfway through the series. I thought it was going to be good after all it was very much hyped when it first came out. But the hype was definitely for nothing. I really really did not like this anime. Give it to me when I was 15 maybe I'd watch it over and over again and it'll make it to my top anime list but not this time around. ,11883,663,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For a video review check out my Youtube channel. Link on my profile page.,11887,664,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I started watching this series having in mind some kawaii anime with cute music something I needed after binge watching Tokyo Ghoul without censorship. Oh how wrong I was.,11889,665,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Another short shown on the Minna no Uta program Kaijuu no Ballad is one of the more interesting ones I've seen solely because of the animation style. If you grew up watching classics like Dark Crystal the monster design will appeal to you. At only few minutes it's a decent enough watch.,11897,666,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sora no Otoshimono (Heaven's Lost Property),11911,667,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sora no Otoshimo... This is the first time I've ever seen an anime that revolved around 1 perverted guy who suddenly is blessed with not 1 but 2 ANGELS!!! Honestly this idea struck me like a boulder! Plus the characters in the story were pretty unique to tell the truth. Not like one of those animes that contains parodies in every 2 minutes of clips like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (it's still pretty funny though). However it seems as if the anime doesn't completely end the story on the last episode though! Like:,11915,668,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So this is the second time that I have reviewed this show going back after I have dropped it before. What do flying underpants a wish granting angel android and a perverted boy have in common? This stupid show. It just feels like a pervert’s joyride. An angel named Ikaros comes down from heaven and ends up with a perverted little boy named Tomoki. I believe he got this bad because of his grandfather. His grandfather would tell him a lot of perverted words of wisdom.,11917,669,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: For an anime that relies on panty-shots and fan service this actually has a plot. It's not always coherent and there are times were it just doesn't make sense. But there is a plot. Or rather there are several plots that try to exist in a 13 episode anime so a lot of the time things seemed... rushed? You have the angeloid plotline with Ikaros and Nymph that was honestly the best plotline and I wish they had just focused on it. Instead you have the  childhood friend  plotline whatever was going on with the class president and Tomoki's ever present puberty-laced fantasies. For a short anime that's a lot to cram in. Espeically when the first few episodes felt like filler. ,11981,676,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show tries to be too much at once. Mostly it tries to be a trendsetter. And yes while some of the charcters such as Nymph and Ikaros are awesome so many of the others are just..... They're some of the worst I've ever come across. The show tries so hard to be the next Highschool DxD or the next To Love-Ru. But what it fails to realize is that those animes were successful not just because of the fanservice but because there were likable charcters to go back to in them. SnO does not have that. Tomoki isn't Issei and Ikaros isn't Lala Satalin Deviluke. Again Ikaros is a good charcter but they try way to hard to make her an awkward alien-type character that they leave out any true personality traits. And while Issei is a perv Tomoki goes way too far way too often and the show's attempts to make his pervertedness funny just comes off as gross. While I will admit that the series made me laugh at a few points and the fanservice is sometimes nice it's not enough to save this cookie-cutter wannabe with no real purpose or true likability behind it. For me at least. ,12029,685,2019-04-13 21:35:40

fter watching the first ep. i couldnt wait to watch the next one. Its about aa normal guy that just wants to live a peaceful life he has had dreams of a girl with wings that he loves and she loves hime back she gets swept away by sky spirits. one day an angel falls from the sky and he rescues her. She becomes his master doing anything she pleases.,12035,687,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sora no Otoshimono (Heaven's Lost Property) has the typical story line for an ecchi anime boy dreams of angel then she falls from the sky. Yes it is the typical story for this type of anime and you probably know what kind of episodes are coming up throughout the series but people don’t watch these because they are original they watch because they either like the characters or like the way the story was told.,12039,689,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sacred Seven is your typical  Boy has awesome powers but can't use them until someone else gives him the ability  shounen anime. You've probably seen the same thing happen in anime like Bleach. The storyline follows Aruma who fits the above cliche by being an outcast with a reputation for violence.,12065,696,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Well this movie I would say is my favorite just because it is about the Romanov family and plays off the conspiricies we now know as false. It is a movie that peaked my intrest due to it being about the Romanov family and the long beloved fabrege eggs. It plays with variations of the facts about the family and plays with also Rasputin's past. It is wonderfully done and I would recommend it to anyone. Especially those who have an interest with the history of the Romanov family. ",12067,697,2019-04-13 21:35:40
 Not really much to say about this one other than that it does not deserve it's average rating that it currently holds. It's not meant to be serious which therefore means there is not much in the way of continuity. Or plot. It's random in other words - completely utterly random. This is not a bad thing though; it leads to a great deal of comedy. Most of which is action-packed and makes as much sense as squirreltape. Whatever that is. At most the only thing in common from episode to episode are the main cast; everything else is constantly changing.,12069,698,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Strange + is about a group of detectives of course they're all outrageous and either get the job done in the craziest way or never get the job done and get sidetracked.

This anime was recommended to me because of its (pseudo)scientific depth. I completely agree; the cheer amount of detail that was put into the science that guides the backstory is painstakingly intricate. So much so in fact that they have little  scientific  shorts to explain relativistic and theoretical physics (and their own sci-fi addendums) in leyman's terms.,12137,711,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gunbuster is by no means bad.  Its characters are likeable and its plot is interesting.  But its main characters simply aren't that well developed and for every awesome scene there are long stretches of mediocrity.  Especially the first two episodes are quite trite but later there is definitely an improvement in later episodes.  I think the real problem this show suffers from is its short length which simply doesn't allow the characters to become unique enough to sympathize with at least to the extent the audience needs to for this to be a truly great anime.  For example there is a character who shows up for only one episode who greatly affects the mian characters actions and I just couldn't bring myself to care about their relationship because he was there for too short a time.  Having said that these characters are charming and even if we the audience aren't sure of their intentions we do learn them by the end without any dramatic reveals (for which I am grateful.)  They are realistic and this show does explore certain implications of space travel especially regarding time in a pretty thought-provoking way.,12157,717,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Only from time to time does one receive the chance to meander across one of the game changers in anime or manga- quite literally in this case. The manga upon which this is based was made by Tezuka the author of Astroboy and the father of manga and anime. That being said the artwork may seem  old school  and the story may seem  clichéd  but that is because it is an old series upon which many newer series have drawn from. Anyways onto the series.,12225,728,2019-04-13 21:35:40

to start this anime is good but lacks a little in some ways. but really gets me is how it ends i just didnt like b/c to me it seemed like there was more to say but they cut it short for some reason. and i think after 10 years they would have made a seconond season already to continue the story but sadly they didnt. b/c now i want to know what happens next but i'll never know.,12291,738,2019-04-13 21:35:40
if you like boobs panty and a horny guy this is for u. The story is very weak about a guy who is a script writer and the actress in his shows do crazy stuff to him to get more screen time. the other half of the story is boobs boobs boobs. this anime would have been good if they dropped the ecchiness level. the only thing i liked about this was how they guy got revenge on the girls who played with his emotions. beside that i found it pointless. if your looking for a good laugh or boobs then this is for u.,12293,739,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In my long list of anime watches I've come to the understanding that weak timid clueless idiotic and down right pathetic men get the best and cutest of girls.  This goes against everything I know in real life and it sorta pisses me off normally.  I fucking hate harems.  It's always a guy like this one in If I see You In My Dreams that has no good qualities whatsoever but has all the worst and best luck in the world.  And it's the kinda best luck we wish we all had but will probably never get.,12337,743,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before i give this short review let me start by saying J.C. Staff has put out some of my favorite anime's next to MADHOUSE which is basically tied with J.C. Staff as far as putting out good anime and in great varietys.......the majority of Romace/Drama/Ecchi/Harem anime's J.C. Staff have put out are some of my favorite anime's some of them even being in my top 10 for the 4 genre's i listed but i have to say this was a little bit of a let down don't get me wrong i enjoyed this anime but it lacks a lot maybe because it was released so long ago i'm not really sure maybe it was on of J.C. Staffs first releases that i am also not sure of because i dont know how long J.C. Staff has been around but this story was very repetative. There are a total of 16 episodes running at around 7 mins each and they all very repepative it is hard for me not to enjoy an anime especially involving romance which is probably what pushed me to finish this one that and it isn't very long but if you aren't a sucker for romance anime's like myself this is going bore you very quick and even possibly even piss you off i won't reveal any details regarding the ending of it except the fact that it wasn't very dissapointing or satisfying had the anime been better and caught my eye maybe i would have been upset with the ending because it isn't neccecarily a happy or sad one at least in my opinion again i'll say it probably didn't affect me much or do much for me because i didn't get that into the anime though i watched it thoroughly anyways that basically it for my review i honestly can't think of any romance anime i would suggest to watch if you enjoyed this because it litteraly wasn't like any anime i have ever seen if you get into it then i guess that's your opinion but to be honest i wouldn't even suggest watching this anime that's litteraly how boring repetative and a waste of time i found it to watch was this the only time i have ever been dissapointed by one of J.C. Staffs anime's.,12341,744,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Once again one of the many reasons why I liked Durarara so much was because each episode jumped around to different character perspectives and the viewer get a wide range of opinions and personalities. Even though this series was enjoyable (to some extent) this arc didn't live up to my expectations. It lacked that something something that made the original Durarara!! phenomenal. Overall all it's a one and done type of season for me. I wouldn't exactly take the time to rewatch it like I have done with other shows even though it is worth watching if you want to catch up with all your old favorite characters.,12373,754,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It’s so stupid but yet I enjoyed watching it. I mean this OVA isn’t even believable while the others could have at least happened at some time during the course of the show. But this one is basically fanfiction. However I have been wanting to see Naruto go through the Chuunin Exams and this gives a little bit of fulfillment for that. It was fun watching Naruto and Konohamaru fight as I don’t recall seeing a real fight between them before. I mean not that Naruto was giving his all but it was still enjoyable to watch. Though I really don’t think Konohamaru is really that skilled… Again that comes back to this OVA being more of fanfiction. It seems to have been written to be humorous and fun without caring about the show’s canon and that’s exactly what it delivers.,12419,764,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Each episode is short. I mean about 1.5 - 2 min long. They make very little sense but they keep you coming back with their quirky characters and interesting animation. The last 4 episodes in particular are very interesting. With a total run time of about 18 min for 9 episodes I would say just watch it. Even if you don't really like it you can see the whole show in the time it takes you to watch a single episode of anything else.,12429,765,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm not really sure how to decribe this besides unique. It starts you off not knowing anything like most stories do but there is almost no plot information given throughout the whole thing. You find out what they're trying to do and thats about it til near the end. And then it gets even wierder and you still don't really learn anything.,12455,775,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A short and average series. The plot and characters are mediocre. The interesting idea of using console wars as a background is not used to its full potential. Nothing surprising to be found here.,12461,776,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm at a loss for words. This is terrible. I've seen better writing on wattpad. This is basically Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction. The characters are terrible they have no development and it starts of thinking the audience is suposed to know them. The first episode starts with Til (or whatever his name is it's totally not Tails) dying so his brother Gear (totally not Sonic) joins the Segua (totally not Sega) army to get revenge on the Ninteldo (totally not Nintendo) empire. I know it's supposed to be based on the 16 bit console wars but at least try to be more interesting with your naming.Except for Gear who has an actual name and not just Sonic spelt wierdly to not resemble the original thing he was based off of. Who is Til? Why should I care about him? Is he dying a reference to Tails dying a lot in Sonic 2? At least explain something before you start off on a tragic not. In the end though it's bad I find it to be a guilty pleasure. If you have nothing else to do and want to laugh at stupid stuff I highly recommend this but watch it with friends.

Kamichama Karin initially caught my interest because I thought that the ability to turn into a goddess would be an interesting concept.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  The powers have nothing to do with the god they are meant to represent - unless of course there happens to be a second god named Athena unknown to me who is the god of frilly pink dresses and random zotage from wands.  However I still found the series entertaining and felt it was worth watching.,12497,784,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i wasnt to sure when i first started this series if I'd like it but once the story really started to unfold i couldnt stop watching it! the characters are cute funny and fit the story well. the the story gets really good as it goes on in my opinion i really like the unexpected turns. i would defenitly recommend this anime to my friends. (and i will) the best things (in my opinion) about this anime is the comedy the characters the cute romance and unexpected story plot.,12499,785,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A lightlyelancholic show with bits of astronomy and romance as main themes that’s how I’describe Hoshizora Kiseki. It’s a calmly paced 27 minute short web episodeith quite a decent story for such a short time span. It has a high “Shinkai”-feelo it (the director of Voices of a Distant Star The Place Promised In Ourarly Days and others) but only lightly evokes human emotion in the viewer somethinghat fitted this particularly story well.,12503,787,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I am a sucker for anything history espcially European History. When I heard that there was an anime about Marie Antoinette I got very exicted. Since I have not seen many European historical anime's this was going to be a special treat. I can see how this show and manga was ground breaking for the time. Thanks to Rose of Versailles shoujo is the way it is today. To my suprise the show stayed pretty acurtate to history around 90% of the time. The characters where strong and very memorable. This anime did not decpict Marie Antoinette as the famous  let them eat cake  but as a young girl who had no idea of the trouble of France and then a woman who had live with it. ,12565,796,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Before you read this I will ask of you to not judge it solely on theigh ratings. I feel like I have explained the reasons for giving themuite well. Please in your rating let me know the way to improve on itnd I will promptly do so. The high animation rating is based on whatould be accomplished at the time the anime was made as I realise thatt would be sub-standard if it were made nowadays.,12591,802,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So this anime is about a girl who moves into this place for people with ansecsters who mingled with monsters.Then she gets a secret sevice agent and they fall in love and so on. i would recommend this if you like a bit of drama with a side of romance and some action. i loved this anime overall.The first episode was like this anime sucks.So i watched it another time and got hoked on this anime.Hope theres more to come.,12623,807,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let’s start this review with the question at the forefront of my mind: WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH?,12637,808,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is both hilarious and thought provoking.,12643,809,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Where do I even begin with this show? I have no idea where to start so I am just going to be upfront. WATCH THIS SHOW. RIGHT. NOW. Its only 12 episodes so its not long so just go and watch it like right now. Like you are literally wasting your time reading this review when you could be watching this show what the hell is wrong with you man? Get your priorities straight. Anyway on a more serious note (as serious as you can get for a show like this anyway) this show is awesome. Did I mention that yet? Yes? Good okay now lets us begin.,12663,814,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I Personally thought this anime was going to Bomb hard but actually its pretty funny. The characters are likable and the story is set up pretty well. Would recommend to watch at least once.,12665,815,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't really know where to start on how good this anime is but I'll try. If you have a really dirty mind or a mildly dirty mind or just like seeing a bunch of random stupidity this is the anime for you. However if your parent's catch you watching this it's one of those anime's where you might as well switch to porn. It's easier to explain.,12669,816,2019-04-13 21:35:40

What to call Wedding Peach DX? Is it a return to form or just aehash of the previous story but with better animation? Well thenswer is both!! This outing does not bring anything new to the overalltory however it is enjoyable all the way through. Fans of Weddingeach will want to see this set of OVAs because you get to see theabulous cast again the bigger budget makes this set consistently wellrawn and animated and these are four fun episodes!,12685,822,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So I was going through the Summer Season list and saw  Gangsta  as one of the titles.  I've been somewhat not into action and leaning towards more comedy and SoL's but I thought that I should just give Gansta a try.,12709,826,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Mild Spoilers in the Plot section,12711,827,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When watching this title I said to myself based on the opening alone it would be an exploitative ride down a dark path of violence sex and bloody action.  Then I watched episode 1 and realized yep not for little boys and girls but then I kept watching. Soon it felt like I was watching a Gonzo title. It has a fantastic start and a so-so end. At first the title seemed like a seedy world of tough guys who bludgeon dice and blast through a trove of gang minions. But then the show seems to take an almost comical turn when they introduce a crime family ran by a young girl. From the point she becomes a bigger character the overall grittyness looses some grit. This is not dreadful it just feels like it changes tone. However what lets Gangsta down a notch is a lack of conclusion. Until I see an ending (it has an on-going manga) then it will probably have to sit at a 6 for story.  ,12715,828,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Shit this looks pretty wildcard for now. Episode 1 start off whiteknight as fuck which kind of ruins the whole gangster theme. They suddenly become the good guys even tho we might have finally had a good anti-hero anime. Instead of some true gangsta's we get some Hoe saving katana happily ever after faggots.,12727,831,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gangsta was one of the series that I've watched in three sittings when the season was heading toward its end. It was something along with Shimoneta that I've been looking forward to watching. The premise was interesting and plenty of hyped comments reached my ears. However as I talked about a week ago about wanting to watch it I was met by snarky comments. And for 6 episoded I didn't know what was wrong.,12753,834,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really enjoyed the non typical story the relationship between Worick and Nic was really interesting. I wasnt a huge fan of all the  Mafia  BS or the female characters huge boobs but it wasnt very Echii which I appreciated. Other than the huge boobs I loved the actual animation I love that they used mostly neutral tones and used bright colors sparingly. The Credit songs are actually really good I am usually picky about the songs but really liked these. Like I said I really like the Main characters and their relationships but most of the side characters were kinda bleh no real depth. I'm usually a S.O.L. /Romance/Comedy  kind of person this was a really nice change for me.,12755,835,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime series could have been really really great.Unfortunately it kinda fizzled out before it ended. The premise was interesting and unique - a deaf gangsta and his partner a gigolo with a photographic memory and gangstas with superpowers running around the neighbourhood. Man it really could have been something. But the series just didn't have enough meat to work with. Plus there were too many side characters. Focus should have been on the 3 main lead characters. *sigh* p/s: Worick and Nick are hot as hell.,12767,839,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Gangsta tried to be a dark alley mafia anime and for the first half of the series it works. The inner workings of these organization are intersting and the development of our leading duo are really satisfying. However recent epsiodes have seen it goin to the dogs by introducing new characters while killing off old ones that no one aside from those who read the manga could be bothered to care about. The show loses its focus in the last arc and our main leading characters are almost nowhere to be seen when shit is all happening.,12769,840,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story good (if second season) animation is alright-ish because i like the style but i dont think it was executed well the sound is alright and the voicing is very good but one of the characters is deaf and cant speak well (makes you feel really bad) and the characters are well done they've been developed well throughout and before the anime.,12771,841,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was the anime I was waiting for the most this year. It looked like a more modern take of stories like Black Lagoon. These kinds on animes can be really good sometimes other times they lack in many departments. So how was Gangsta?,12783,843,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a spoiler-free review.,12789,844,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Of the anime starting this season that I've seen I can't say this is my favorite although I wouldn't say it's quite at the bottom. Honestly the show isn't bad and I did keep clicking the next episode button however it's lacking that pull that draws me in and makes me feel like I can't wait for the next episode to air. I feel like I can wait and the other animes I have watched that started this season I'm dying for their next episodes. I do think I will still finish it when it all comes out but I'm not crazy excited for it. It's decent enough to watch but not good enough to be one of my favorites.,12791,845,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:,12823,853,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Detroit Metal City AKA DMC is a (slice of life) 15minutex25 episode comedy anime about music with much crudeness and shoddy attempts at romance. I’ll disclose that I’m a fan of metal not as much for death metal these days but I appreciate it. As I enjoy that genre of music this anime came across terribly to me initially. I guess it’s aimed at older teenage boys/adult because of the outrageous and vulgar content. They exaggerate many aspects of this industry but even with this purpose I didn’t appreciate it mainly because of the shoehorned romance angle and that Soichi was trying to act two different ways while trying to form a relationship with Yuri. That aspect of this anime is the worst least enjoyable bit but there are other bits that were actually funny.,12833,854,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,12835,855,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright so me being kind of an elitist metalhead will say that DMC is definitely not a death metal band nor is it deathcore as somebody tried to say I wouldn't say its metal either.  I'd say its more like pop death.  But anyways there are not really much references to any bands if any other to Emperor in the final episode.  However what this show lacks in significance to metal it makes up for in the fact that is absolutely hilarious.  Watching the main character battle between his two selves is entertaining and didn't get old like people in some of the other reviews have said.  I found myself laughing my ass off.  Overall if you need a good laugh and don't mind a little crude humor then this anime is for you.,12851,856,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of my favorites anime's. I don't have much to say. When you see an anime it's very common that the end let you down. Well this is not the case at all. Monster always keeped me intrigued and i think i watched all the series in 3 days. Highly recommended but only if you have patience because it can be really slow sometimes (Not that i care),12875,863,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Unlike other hugely overrated anime such as Death Note and Attack on Titan Monster is the real deal. The show is a very well-written and beautifully animated psychological thriller that is different in many ways from other typical anime shows that would usually rely heavily on endless flashbacks and pointless elaborate explanations for their ridiculous impossible plots.,12881,866,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:  The story for  Monster  is nothing short of fantastic.  There is something to be said about the fact that I marathoned through this anime and it's 74 episodes.  The story sets up the incredibly talented Dr. Tenma.  He makes the decision to perform surgery on a young boy with a bullet wound to the head and save the boys life.  The surgery is a success and the boy dissappears from the hospital.  The boy reappears as a young man and reveals to Tenma that he has become a killer.  Feeling responsible for the boys life Tenma also feels that it is his responsibility to kill him.  This anime was full of intrigue and action.  There were scenes so intense I was left breathless.  Furthermore there is a lot to be said about how an anime ends (no spoilers I promiss).  This had one of the best anime endings I have ever seen.  The last ten episodes leading up to the finale were so shocking my roommate asked if I was ok because my reactions were so big.,12901,874,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A really weird experience for me.  I have watched a lot of anime and have always been a student of Eastern philosophy and culture.  If you are a westerner and have ever wondered what it might be like if our culture was more like eastern cultures then watch this show.  I admit that I am no judge of what eastern culture is but this is not how people talk describe interact show emotion etc... in any place I have ever been.  The dialog and the characters' behavior and reactions match most anime that I have seen.  What makes this so strange to watch for me is that it is set in western countries and almost all the characters I have seen so far are supposed to be locals.  The old doctor in the first scenes of the first episode looks to be modeled after Wilford Brimley.  But he talks like he's sitting in a Zen garden.  I highly recommend this very unique anime for any westerner like me.,12917,878,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have not yet finished this anime but I will be done tonight. I fell in love with this anime quickly sad that it only has a few episodes. I love Noe her character is so cute! I love that she always says roaches are on Shinichiro I really recommend this anime if you like love triangles! Be prepared for tears though.,12993,895,2019-04-13 21:35:40
At first when I saw this Anime I was thinking that this was going to be a typical High School romance sort of Anime and at the time of deciding what Anime's to watch I wanted it to be a Simple high school romance. I came into the Anime expecting a drizzle of excitement at most but was met with the might of a powerful storm! This Anime completely exceeded my expectations in many ways while there were several things I could predict throughout the Anime there were a lot of unexpected factors I wasn't able to predict and a lot of them were main plot points. I honestly think I underestimated this Anime and was punished fantasically for it. I was so glued to the screen I had trouble at work and I ended up finishing this Anime in a single day because it was so fantastic. I must point out how important fascinating and extremely important the character Noe was. She was literally one of the main pillars that held this Anime together. Even though the other two mains were decent it was in fact Noe that created the true heart of this Anime. The Anime did a good job of not only building up drama but creating a momentium between each episode that continued to gain speed each and every time never slowing down and always keeping you excited and glued to the screen which I believe is an extremely important feature that most Anime of this genre I watch lack. So fast was the momentium I think I ended up crashing near the exciting end and conclusion of this Anime. I loved this Anime far more than I ever expected I would. I'm absolutely shocked at seeing the reviews of this Anime that they are giving it such grief. I believe the cause of this is personal bias/(hatred) towards one or two of the main characters. I must agree I actually hated Hiromi a lot actually and very rarely could I ever look kindly her way in the Anime However its because the Anime isn't afraid to create those kinds of characters who start out that way and then change over time that helps create a better story. I think each character played out their part very well despite all of my personal feelings of hatred and whatnot. I loved this Anime and I am absoutely glad I had the opportunity to watch it. ,12995,896,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A long time ago I watched the first four episodes of LAIN on a anime convention and it was so mysterious goodlooking and odd that I couldn't help myself liking it. Years later I picked it up and started watching the whole thing from start to finish but a little more than halfway I gave up. What happened to make me go from intrigued to bored?,13029,899,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Serial Experiments Lain breaks from the gray monotony of the Anime world like a Formula 1 car with a blown front tire of his trail. This anime is rightly cult and sets standards to this day. Who is looking for a philosophic and artistic talent can not get past LAIN.,13041,900,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"At first glance many people may not want to watch Lain because it's so slow-paced and confusing but actually this is most of what makes the series good. SEL is an eerily quiet slow-moving psychological and hard to follow cyber-punk that will have you glued to the screen for its entire 13-episode duration. The concept is great and the music is awesome if you like techy-stuff (I own the soundtrack and listen to it regularly). ",13055,904,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Serial Experiments Lain... I should have written a review as soon as I saw it because it pretty complex but i'll give my best.,13153,923,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Serial Experiments Lain can be very mentally stimulating at times but gets so lost in its own imagery and philosophy that the story and the viewer both suffer.  SEL can be very hard to follow and at times will throw things at you so weird you'll question your ability to continue on through the series.  If you stick with it and really dig deeply this series has some great ideas and concepts.  It's just too damned hard to get to them sometimes.  I'd only recommend this anime if you aren't put off by abstract imagery and concepts and only if you want part of the experience of an anime to involve philsophizing between episodes.,13159,924,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Should you watch this show? Are you in the mood for a quasi-hyperexistentialism show which may of may not leave you terribly confused? (p.s. if you don't know what existentialism is then you won't get this show as such don't watch it) Yeah why not?,13161,925,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Serial experiments was an anime I really thought I would like. It was from the maker of one of my absolute favorites Texhnolyze so I figured chances of me enjoying it were high. Unfortunately Lain is very far from being a substantial anime and it's story/characters suffer from the overcrowded story.,13163,926,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Serial Experiments Lain is really something else. I was very much intrigued right after watching the alternative MTV-style introduction sequence. Lain dares to be different from the usual anime formula and I find that quite refreshing.   The plot focuses on the connection between the real world and the wired world (cyber world). It's very timely since computers and the internet are booming at this point. If the advent of TV brought about the birth of couch potatoes now we have people who'd rather live online in front of the PC for the most part of their lives. Lain herself is one of those people. She gets caught up in the wired world so much that the lines between her online and offline life have started to blur. The series is divided into layers (their creative way of referring to episodes). Each layer has its own theme and title which is loaded with double meanings. There is a lot of visual imagery which is yours to interpret or ignore. Splotches of red on shadows cast by objects... shadowy faceless figures who are supposed to be the people around you... The imagery doesn't get in the way of the plot it's there as more of an enhancement to the overall Lain experience.   Lain's cinematography is the best I've seen in an anime. Each scene is well-thought out and exceptionally composed conveying more than words ever could. I find the art and animation fascinating as well. No one is pretty or handsome by the usual anime standards but something about the way they are drawn just draws you right in. Some may find the artwork un-pretty or un-glamorous compared to the usual anime art but it's actually very much suited for the series and is very unique and appealing in its own way.   The overall mood is on the dark side and there is a bit of existential philosophy involved. Some parts of the anime are admittedly difficult to grasp but the overall concept is pretty understandable. Lain features some very good alternative music as well. I especially like the opening theme  Duvet . The English dubbing is very good but they change the names slightly (like Arisu to Alice etc.). The only qualm I have about Lain is the lack of background info that supposedly came only with the Sony playstation game which doesn't even have an English version.,13165,927,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,13167,928,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As you peruse through a large amount of anime you come across many different types of series that leave unique impressions; some of these impressions will last some will fade some will be good some not so good and some... well some will be Series Experiments Lain. Lain is one of those series that among definitely leaving a very lasting impression it is very likely to leave you wondering what you just watched. While mixing together a large amount of philisophical questions psychological explanations and something of a technological anomaly in order to peace together its stroy and in particular Lain. While someone that is not aware of specific philisophical and psychological mind sets may get a very different point of view when watching this series I do not think that this is all of a bad thing. Perhaps in this case the viewer would be better off not completely comprehending the discourse that this series encompases but should instead rewatch this series several times in order to understand what is going on. However being a philosophy major with some background in computer science and psychology has robbed me of this chance and I often could guess what they were attempting to do as the series went on leaving a large portion of the  mindf*ck  not in it for me. I am not attempting to say that I say everything coming or properly understood absolutely all of this series just that the blade may have been dulled for me. Despite this I still enjoyed the series although in perhaps a different manner than many people that watch this show may have.,13169,929,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,13171,930,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There are really only a few words that can be used to describe SEL mainly convoluted and contradictory. I say contradictory because it did a lot of things that didn't mesh well and for the most part I think this was done purposefully. Maybe it was for artistic flair but for me it just got in the way of what could have been a good story.,13173,931,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Many people won't like this anime. It is slow paced and you should watch it more than once to understand everything. But personaly it is one of my favorate animes. The opening song is one of my favorates and there is something about this anime that makes me want to watch it again and again. If you need every little thing spelled out to you in a story line then this anime just wont be for you.,13175,932,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you like the question of  what exactly was real here?  then look no further. This is the ultimate anime for budding philosophers who want to explore the borders between reality and imagination. Of course the cynical outlook is that this is cereal box intellectualism aimed at stoned college students. Both are true. Yet that does not take away from the fact that this is a unique and fascinating work of art.,13177,933,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"If you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything. Maybe one day I'll follow my own advice. When I was first formally introduced to anime years ago Eiken was one of the first shows I’ve had the displeasure to encounter. It has been over five years since I witnessed the horrors of the first episode. I swore to never finish the series until now. Here’s the rundown: some guy attends this school-island-thing where elementary middle and high schools are all contained. Some festival-contest-thing happens and the aforementioned guy winds up being in it with a team of chicks with massive….ahem…..assets. With this show labeled under fanservice there are more than enough unholy thoughts going through anyone’s mind upon viewing. ",13217,942,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If the greatness of an anime depended on boobs then this obviously would be the best of everything. At least until the record-breaking OVA Eiken 2: Boobs Breasts and Bazoongas at the Beach. But since there are other  factors  that determine greatness it ruins the chance of a more perverted and borderline nudity-riddled sequel and Eiken's shot at world domination.,13231,946,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Just finished The book of Bantorra I know it is an old anime but i just got around to watching it. First off this is an awesome yet really sad/dark anime but the characters are cool and awesome. I fell in love with Noloty. It has really hot chicks that kick ass and most of the episodes have really interesting stories however if you are suicidal do not watch this anime I don't think you would make it to the end of this series lol!!! (I'm laughing but also kind of serious lol).  The Plots were quite good however I think they could have made a better ending but that is just my opinion.  I would rate it at 7.5 out of 10 and I highly suggested you watch it you will not be disapointed.,13253,953,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As a kid you will like this because it has action its pretty original and its colorful. If you ever play the games however you quickly realize that basically every player in the series is retarded. Believe me. I played something like 300 games with my roommate with full deck codes and lets just say that the complexity of the game in the anime doesnt even come near the real thing. If you hadnt tried out the game yet try it its one of the best strategic multiplayer games in existence(believe it or not). ,13263,957,2019-04-13 21:35:40

God I tried to watch this when I was little and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was cool all the fighting and the really cool animation. But honestly the animation is mediocre the story is subpar at best and the supposed difficulty of the actual game is no where similar in real life. Honestly the game was 150 times easier than the anime made it seem and that forced me to hate the characters. I wish this had been a better anime so that I could still enjoy it in my later years but for this anime I think that is impossible.,13281,960,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Vampire Knight is one of the Twilight's of the anime world: it doesn't live up to its hype. Yuuki was essentially a very flat character Zero was very annoying after the millionth shot of him with no shirt on brooding Kaname was very creepy until you realised that he and Yuuki aren't actually direct siblings and every other character was essentially non-existent. The plot - wait there was a plot? - was lame. It is addictive to the Twilight fangirl brain but not that good if you don't like that kind of thing.,13311,967,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The plot feels a little light I think it relies on an attempt at a love story and fan girl elements (attempted sexiness everywhere! Biting shirtless-ness pushing against walls etc.). If you're 13 years old or enjoyed Twilight I think you will probably enjoy this. If you're looking for a more mature plot I don't think you will find much enjoyment here. It had the potential to be a really dark brooding plot and I watched on it a recommended assuming that it would be this way instead it came off as a bit immature. ,13325,968,2019-04-13 21:35:40

By the title and cover/preview pictures of this anime alone should make it very obvious that this is another vampire shoujo.

This is a great romance anime jam-packed with tons of supense. If you are a twilight fan you will definitely love this. (If you hated Twilight then you should also watch this. Maybe the vampires can redeem themselves) The story falls around a young girl Yuuki. She was saved by a  good vampire . She can't remember anything before that situation. As the story rolls on many things about her past began to reveal itself. Please watch!! The animation is really great; however the music is not that great. It's not the kind of music that you would rewind over and over or download to your Ipod (In my opinion),13403,983,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story is flat characters are flater then story. I didn't like very much the story becouse of characters who just didn't act logically and made stupid decisions.

I don't think i could say anything negative about this anime even if i wanted to Vampire Knight was the very first anime i watched ever! and because of it i am a full fledged anime watcher i fell in love with anime while watching this show. And i hope that if you watch this anime you'll love anime more that you do now. ,13423,989,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First off for all of you who may think this is a Twilight wannabe back off because the original manga came out in July 2005 while Twilight came out in October 2005. ,13427,990,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Vampire Knight is a 13 episode shoujo anime about vampires with the obvious splattering of romance featuring bishounen (beautiful boys). At a glance it looks like a typical shoujo anime and I was debating whether this was worth my time to watch. Since I’ve given shoujo a chance before I decided to give it a go. Crucially the story seemed initially predictable but was this worth the watch?,13431,992,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story,13433,993,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm not completely sure how I was drawn to this anime but I have to admit it's 100% better than any Twilight movie. This was one of the few drama anime that I've seen. The entire time it gave me that feeling of curiosity for what would happen next. I kept wanting to know more of the story and before I knew it it was over. Vampire Knight is an amazing anime that somehow lures people in like a  vampire's mind controlling gaze.  I would definitely recommend it for those that more story in their anime. I personally stopped everything else just to finish this.,13435,994,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fans might bash me for this but for those who read the manga some might agree with me. This anime in my opinion wasn't exactly worth the watch. I kept expecting something good to come out of the anime and sat through the whole thing only to be disappointed by it.,13439,995,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,13441,996,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I know my overally rating was low compared to other scores I gave and I think this is with good reason. I really don't know where to start with this so here I go.,13449,997,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh boy where to begin. This is a girl meets dog romance. I will start off by saying that this anime will probably offend and disgust many. I'm pretty open minded and not easily offended. It's just a bizarre show. Not for kids. It's a comedy with fanserve and some nudity. This show is very Japanese so for many Westerner's it might be too off putting and they may not see what's so comedic of the show. I personally didn't think it was funny only for the grooming/hair cut scene. ,13501,8,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Now when you're watching anime what's the last thing you're going to think of? If you guessed Family Guy you're right (at least that's the last thing I always think of). But that's all you'll be comparing this show to and thinking about with this waste of potential.,13503,9,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So far this anime can go either way. I am hoping that it is good (and not like Episode 0 that they showed before hand with the nonstop fanservice) but so far it's alright. The second episode was pretty cute. Here's to hoping. Also I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about. Kirito and this guy have nowhere near the same personality and honestly I don't think they look the same either. I did not get an SAO feeling from this at all.,13511,13,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I've recently taken to watching short anime and this is the shortest i've seen so far. I thought maybe 10 minutes isn't enough for an anime but i thought i should have a look anyway. I really liked the story the characters and the animation despite how short it is. The animation really adds to the story. It like watching a black and white movie but with brief flashes of colour mostly red. ",13599,29,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Children are mean that's what I learned when I was young even in Highschool they don't change much. This anime is what what it is. Slice of life beautiful and ugly at the same time more beauty then ugly though.,13629,32,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay so I have read/watched anime and manga across the board from horror to romance and if you are looking for a really heartwarming love story that takes you by surprise watch Suki-tte li na yo. Trust me the way the characters react is paralell to real life and is by far the best romance-type anime you can watch I highly reccomend :D,13663,37,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sukitte ii na yo was one of the best romatic anime i have watched the storyline is awesome its perfect for otaku's who love to watch romance genre. Its really beautiful to watch how love has grown between tachibana and kurosawa beside all the differences they have... i watched all the episodes in one day this anime is a must to watch.,13673,40,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely LOVED this anime!,13675,41,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sick of love traingles?! Want to see the couple get together in the first few episodes?,13677,42,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Huh. I didn't know there were loner fantasy animes animes with female protagonists too. Also that wasn't a roundhouse kick.,13679,43,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A lovecom that have it's dark parts at certain points.,13681,44,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I honestly fell in love with this anime.,13691,45,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was something you dont see in anime alot. Realistic. I couls easily picture everything that happened in it happening in real life. It was sweet and mellow very down to earth. I loved the characters and their growth as individuals and as a couple. (In case you havent figured it out by the title picture or descritpion this is a romance based anime). It was a relaxing watch. I didnt jump up and down shouting excitedly or want to cry my eyes out at any point but I felt happpy when things went well for them and sad when it didnt. It evoked all the right kinds of feelings you are supposed to get when you watch something like this. Worth the watch if you want a low energy romantic anime that goes along at a steady pace.,13693,46,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I  personally am not a big fan of romance anime's as i find them boring and always cliche with their story lines how ever Say i love you for me was very enjoyable i highly recommend it! i do think this would be the perfect anime for teenagers as it has elements that every teenage girl feels at some point during high school. As a perfect anime to the beginners as its not very serious with the plot but isn't cute and child like. All in all id say 10/10 brilliant and must watcg ,13731,50,2019-04-13 21:35:40
" ",13755,51,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Say  I Love You  or Suki-tte li na yo is totally recommended if you are a romance anime junkie. However it's not as cliche as it seems to be. I have been wanting to watch this anime for awhile and while I had a friend over I decided why the heck not. My friend fell in love with this anime and the charcters. The story doesn't twist too much to the point where you want to rip you're hair out. (one of those animes is Kimi ni Todoke another review for that anime later.) The anime wraps up the story nicely and although short episode wise it's pretty long story wise. Say  I Love You  had a certain touch to it that made it slightly realistic and not too boring or dragging you along. However I will say Tachibana Mei is a Mary-Sue. Some may not agree but I think everything was going a little too perfect for her throughout the story. Every girl is entitled to their own fairytale. However if I see this with my own 2 eyes with real people I shall change my opinion,13757,52,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,13759,53,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I hated this OVA. The first 52 episodes were perfect mirroring the manga up to about book 14 and leaving the audience happy with how Miaka did what she did and rescuing both the book world and the real world. Season 2 was easy to get along with being the other half of the manga series up to the last one (18). This horrible cash in ruins the entire story! I hate it and I hate how it ruins everything that the characters (and the audience) went through.,13767,54,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,13769,55,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Gintama is one of the epics of Jump and is one of the more popular shows thats existednever have a I enjoyed a series more than this. The story is interesting but at the same time rarely touched upon by the show...its more a less a couple funny episodes and arcs; with more series arcs telling the stories. There is no Start to finish getting stronger training hard...its the antics of 3 peopleKaguraGintokiand Shinpachi who try to make it in an alien filled Edo...nothing more nothing less. The animation is greattheres better animation but theres never been a poorly animated scene in this show. The music is catchy and memorable. The characters even the most boring ones(Yamazaki/Shinpachi) are my favorites and are as loveable as the rest of the cast. Each character fits into Gintama like a Hand in a glove even the ones with no screen time make me smile when they return for a 1 minute gag. ,13781,56,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Point blank these specials are basically just one long strip show. The speicals were strickly made for fanservice and serve no actual purpose to the original anime. Admittingly I'm a guy who enjoys his lolis but not in a sexual manner so the third special made me pretty uncomfortable but besides that one the others were alright I guess. I'm more of an ass man and not a breast guy either so needless to say Hedyeh was the victor in my opinion. Almost no one had a nose and each special only had one song which was actually nice and soothing.,13827,68,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Before I go into this if you are the type of person who judges a movie or show based on the book or game it was based off of you are a fool in my eyes. If a  movie will never be as good as the book it's written off of  then you should give up your petty argument and try judging it as a work of cinema not as a work of literature. The thought of taking a 50 hour gameplay game and squishing it into a 10 hour series will of course leave out very important aspects. That being said the Video game is a GREAT video game much as the anime is a GREAT anime even if there was alot of important information lost along the way.,13833,70,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Tales of the Abyss is a 26 episode fantasy adventure anime with plenty of action some comedy and even a dash of romance. The plot and setting are in the style of a JRPG no doubt because this is based upon a game of the same name released in the PS2 era. As such expect a very complete and progressive story. I’ve never played any of the Tales games I don’t have the time for lengthy RPGs these days but the plot of this anime is very promising and stands out a lot. Being based on a game it has many advantages and despite having never played the games this seems to be a decent adaptation from the view of an outsider. There have been a few anime made from the Tales games and this one seems to be the most complete.,13835,71,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There are plenty of reviews for Revolutionary Girl Utena that are better than what I can hope to come up with so I'll just use this space to write my impressions. I started watching Revolutionary Girl Utena without knowing exactly what to expect although after having read a couple of reviews I did know that I could set my expectations high. And the anime is definetely worth a watch. More than one watch actually; I've just finished the last episode and I have to admit that I'm sure many things escaped my notice and that I didn't pay the due attention to many other things so I will probably watch it again in the future. ,13863,79,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Before you read this review I would ask of you to please not judget solely on the high rating.

What's better than a 24-minute episode of our favorite Yuru Yuri anime? An OVA that is 1 hour long. Yes that's 60 minutes of Yuri Yuri's cute cast. Is it really worth watching for an hour or is this OVA a bust. ,13955,87,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Venus Wars is something like  Red Dawn  in space a military conquers a city on Venus and a youth motorcycle gang have to team up with a rogue reporter and some remnants of the local military to go against the larger army. The Animation is simply amazing absolutely fluent and jam packed with detail. The music is also really good with at least a half-dozen original 80s j-rock tunes. I watched the anime dubbed in English so I can't vouch for its Japanese audio track but I felt the dub wasn't bad. ,13959,88,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series is RANDOM and HILARIOUS. The point is to shed some light on the life of our MC the Mediator whose job is undescribeable and takes her around doing all kind of weird stuff with her friends the fairies. It tells stories that are a few episodes long and it does manage to hold attention very well all the way through. The animation is obviously cheap and quick but good enough to keep viewers watching. The sounds are solid acting is good and the fairies are adorable.,13971,92,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Humanity Has Declined is on the surface a super-cute show with some super-cute mysteries. But the secret to the show is actually in the name. Every single two-episode arc focuses on a different part of the troubles of society. The scathing critique is hidden behind colorful and simpistic art cheerful voice acting childish humor a positive soundtrack friendship and cutesy metaphors. The self-destructive nature of consumerism shallowness of culture loss of connection to reality the search for self definition and more get their moment in the particularly bright sun.,14007,95,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If there's one thing I've learned about anime it's that DVD Specials are mediocre and therefore not worth one's time. I'm not quite sure what they were thinking with this one; it's just a bunch of short videos played on an internet video-looking window showing the usual Gundam stuff; testing out a Gatling gun sand clogging up the mech and so on. Gundam fan or not give this one a miss.,14039,98,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Paranoia Agent is a really good show with interesting characters realistic looking animation a cool soundtrack and a clever story. However I didn't really find it all that scary or suspenseful and you may be disappointed if you are looking for that in this show.

Paranoia Agent Review,14067,103,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Paranoia Agent is a very confusing and trippy seires with each episode focusing on different characters leading up to them getting attacked by Shonen Batto; each episode is a self contained story but never leaving out the detectives who are trying to solve the case. I enjoyed the first three episodes then it got boring and it really came back in episode 8 - this episode is about three members of an internet suicide pact with their goal throughout the whole episode being to kill themselves; it's certainly the best and most intresting episode and I'd really love it more if the whole seires was about these three. The last three episodes are really stupid though and throws the pychological logic out of the window and the series becomes alot more complicated then it really needs to be.,14069,104,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I purchased the four-volume edition of this series at Animinneapolis for far too much money I wasn't certain of what to expect. After all it's an expired Geneon/Pioneer product and the rarity of such colleter's editions is typically what defines their dollar value. As a matter of fact this series can be had--in general--for less than a copy of Geneon's When They Cry Complete Collection. If dollar value was at all indicative of quality I was not in for an enjoyable experience.,14175,118,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Review of:  Touhou Project (Memories of Phantasm),14249,132,2019-04-13 21:35:40
From the very start you can see how Kara no Kyoukai Movie 5: Mujun Rasen is going to be better than one through four in the series. The opening has intelligent backgrounds original cinematography hints of extreme violence and the supernatural and most of all a sense of intrigue. What's more the movie continues to build upon that. But the big thing is that this is the first one of the series to actually have movie length quality pacing and production.,14253,133,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,14267,134,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kara no Kyoukai – Mujun Rasen (AKA Paradox Spiral) is the 2 hour 5th movie in the supernatural seinen mystery series with aspects of psychological and romance based upon the series of Type-Moon universe novels written by Kinoko Nasu. This movie is set after all of the previous movies and starts to really connect all the plot together. It also reveals the narrative to be supremely complex almost mind-meltingly. The character behind the scenes is revealed and there’s just so much plot here compared to the previous movies (especially movie 4). This was 2 segments worth in the book. Instead of the usual single segment thus I’m glad it’s 2 hours instead of the usual 1 hour. There’s just so much going on here. This is one movie that perhaps defines the madness (the good kind) of the Kara no Kyoukai series. Of course read my reviews of the previous movies if you haven’t already there’s a lot there that remains similar or the same or I just feel the same way and thus you’ll find those sections refer you to previous reviews anyway. I’d copy and paste if folks can’t be bothered to click on a hyperlink since I’d be saying the same things but just wording them differently. This is also the last movie chronologically in the original Kara no Kyoukai series there are 2 more and then some standalone stories.,14277,135,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A  perfect  score is a very difficult thing to give especially in this day and age where standards expectations and preferences are changing more rapidly than ever before. However I can give Mujun Rasen the fifth installment of the Kara no Kyoukai film series a perfect score without regret or doubt.,14289,137,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've seen quite a few movies and shows that deal with the interactions between humans and androids and what happens when those androids start becoming self-conscious but none have done so in a way as thoughtful mature and nuanced as Eve no Jikan and in only 105 minutes. There's no extremist apocalypse or dystopia like you'd find in A.I. I Robot Blade Runner or any other Hollywood sci-fi films. No hyperbole but no sugar-coating as well.,14293,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40

What the actual fuck how do people think this shit is good? It's about some shitty androids suddenly having a  free will  without any goddamn backstory about how they are independent beings and can think for themselves. Why do they have an anti android movement? Who was so fucking stupid to only make 3 general rules to follow for the androids? And how the fuck are they obliged to follow people's commands but can they still lie to them?,14347,142,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hourou Musuko,14537,162,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hourou Musuko is definitely a hidden gem that I wish I had discovered sooner. The story is heavy on gender identity and what it means to be comfortable as yourself. A majority of the characters are well-rounded with their own personal struggles. A few being that Nitori is a boy who has always wished that he were a girl Takatsuki wishes that she were a boy and Ariga wants to be cute like Nitori and suspects that he is gay. While much of the story revolves around gender especially Nitori's it is not the only concern giving it more of a realistic feel and the message that gender is not everything. I think that this is a good watch for anyone interested in LGBT issues as well as those just wanting a good piece of drama. Each episode gave me a new set of feels and I felt that each scene had a purpose unlike some anime.,14539,163,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've read a number of reviews for this anime and it seems that either you love it or you are quite indifferent to it. I must say that I'm in the middle. I'm not overly enthusiastic about it but on the other hand I wouldn't consider it a waste of time. If you are into the more thought-provoking slow-paced and realistic anime.  ,14617,168,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a very special anime.  Not only is it an absolute delight from start to finish it's one of those rare shows that seems to enrich your life after you've seen it.  Or at least it did mine; not that I'd ever held any prejudices against transgendered individuals before I saw this show (far from it) but seeing the lives of young children with gender identity issues dramatized the issue in a way that made me understand it better and enriched my perception of the world around me.  It's a powerful anime that can do that; only a few have in the past (Kino's Journey and Grave of the Fireflies are two others which means this show is in pretty tremendous company).,14623,169,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I find this review somewhat difficult to write. Starting out with this series I couldn't keep the characters straight and found myself finding it difficult to keep interest in but to an extent this series got better as it went on. The story and characters were interesting but being a series focussing on topics that I feel very far removed from I simply couldn't relate. As the story progresses it brings about more relatable events and characters which I supposed made the series slightly more engauging and helped me keep up with it. The story is a good one but as I have said the topic is just too far away for many people especially people like myself to get too engauged in. The art style and animation in this series is fairly unique but nothing overly intriging. The opening and ending are very enjoyable and the music in the series is more or less acceptable. If you have an interest in people with gender confusion or go through that yourself it would definitely be worth looking into. Beyond that I couldn't say I would really recommend it to anyone.,14627,170,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At first glance I only watched this anime because I thought that the water colour graphics were pretty.  After reading the premise I wasn't  turned off  per say but I was a little more amused than anything.  However this story line has something to offer that quite a bit of anime are lacking: the complete and total exploration of the human soul.  I have never seen such a beautifully crafted anime that is able to create such a character development in only 11 episodes.,14647,174,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I started this series and was very impressed by the first few episodes. The art was pretty good and the characters seemed pretty solid. But as the series went on I begain to realize that it wasn't at all what I thought it would be. The main story is never really concluded and in fact it doesn't even matter since half of the series is this epic flashback. Mind you during this you learn some neat information that explains the present story but it makes you wonder if the present is even the real story at all. Sound was average. The choice of vocice actors was very good and the music was nothing spectacular. It didn't stand out but it didn't detract from the series either. As for the characters I found they were either love or hate. But for me they all just seemed to have to total ineptitude in their problem solving skills causing very much hate of them on my part. Over all it's kind of a pretty anime but I don't think it makes for a good series. It would have made a better OVA series if anything.,14669,180,2019-04-13 21:35:40

9.5 thats a high score! But this anime really does deserve this. The fighting the story and everything else is just top notch. I really enjoyed watching this anime.,14713,184,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be honest this series had huge potential but the flashback was dragged on for far to long i think it about 10 episodes long.  I loved the first couple of episodes but it just went downhill.,14719,185,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have no idea why I added this anime to my list but the concept seemed OK. Before watching this I found this on a top 10 worst anime list on youtube and the place I got it from mentioned something about a terrible ending. This didn't affect my viewing of the anime. This has a lot of fighting some comedy and *sigh* ecchi/panty shots too.,14735,186,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gekijouban Gintama Kanketsuhen: Yorozuya yo Ein Nare or in a more pronounceable way Gintama: The Final Chapter: Be Forever Yorozuya is the second Gintama movie released at this time though with a subtitle being  The Final Chapter  it is widely presumed this is the ending to the Gintama anime. Is this right or is the gorilla author trolling us again? Well I'll get back to that later.,14743,188,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fue un largo viaje desde que me aventure en el genial mundo de Gintama siempre con ganas de saber de qué iba la cosa hasta que me di la tarea de ver todas sus temporadas ovas y películas. Siendo esta Gintama Kanketsu-hen: Yorozuya yo Eien Nare su segunda película la que ponga fin al camino (Por ahora confió que así sea).,14749,189,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So far this season has started off great from the start the story is in place. They seem to following the Mukami storyline from the game. Besides the opening few minutes of the first episode where they showed the Tsukinami brothers Carla (CV: Morikawa Toshiyuki) and Shin (CV: Morikubo Shōtarō) I doubt that they will play a role this season just a bit of foreshadowing if there is a third season based off of Dark Fate.,14751,190,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really love this one. The female lead is not the usual damsel in distress and she holds her own despite having no knowledge of the spirit world. The characters are a riot and they are very fun to watch especially the little sprites of the temples. I also liked the style of the drawing(?) I'm not sure what to call it but its really well drawned and very detailed. ,14893,207,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I liked the characters in this show and the way they reacted with each other and I have started reading the anime. I have a few questions that the anime didn't address mainly points that were in the story I wont mention them for spoiler reasons. But I thought that the voice were great with the characters my favourite being Tomoe I saw a recommendation for Kamisama Hajimemashita through Inu X Boku SS and they are both funny and brilliant to watch.,14913,208,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,14921,209,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of my personal favourites. I would recommend this anime to anyone looking for a good romance/forbidden love. You know those kind of anime you have to know how the story is going to carry out? This one is how it was for me. Out of all the shoujo anime I've watched so far this one is still my top favourite!,14935,210,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,14941,211,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely adore this anime. It is the perfect combination of romance and comedy there's small situations but they are always resolved quickly and the overall plot is just light and fun! One of my favorite animes that I watch over and over!,14947,212,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I thought it would be a nice change of pace to switch from watching younger shoujo anime like Kamichama Karin and Gakuen Alice to a more  mature  one but Kamisama Hajimemashita proved me wrong.,14949,213,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love the story I love the romance and I love the characters. The one but in this is that in the beginning I wanted to punch Tomoe in the face…a lot. Nanami had seen hardship after hardship and gets thrown a curveball she neither asked for nor expected but Tomoe is a cranky butthead (not the word I really want to use but I will keep it pg) and takes it out on her. You get to hear later on more on why he is the way he is but I still think he starts out a bully and want to hit him. Other than my bouts of craving violence against fox boy (Tomoe) I enjoy the characters. The sprites are adorable and good comedic relief. Nanami doesn’t give up no matter who or what she faces. She does need saving but a human playing in the world of gods (not by her own choice) will have that situation sometimes no matter who they are so it didn’t annoy me as much as other damsels do. The art was beautiful; all the characters were amazingly drawn. The music matched the anime for feel. The story progressed as expected with a small curveball thrown in here and there. It was obvious how it would end but the anime wasn’t about the unknown so much as the journey the characters took to get to the end result. It was sweet and simple and a perfect pick me up when you believe love is hopeless.,14967,216,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime was one of the first anime I have watched and it amazed me! It's a cute romantic story it may not be fast paced and full of action but takes things differently. It is such a beautiful anime and I recommend to anyone looking for a romantic comedy.,15005,221,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"    When I first opened up episode one of Kamisama Hajimemashita I didn't have that immediate  Oh I can tell I'm going to love this!  reaction like I do with some animes.  It looked a little too girly and the line  God I want to be a naughty girl  in the opening theme threw me for a loop.  I thought  Oh god I don't think this is my type of show.   However you shouldn't let those things fool you! Kami-sama Hajimemashita was a great anime and there are plenty of things about it to set it apart from  that stereotypical shoujo show. ",15037,224,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of my new favorite series.  Its also very true to the Manga which is nice.  There's plenty of folklore and traditional Japanese mythology woven into the story while the story itself is everything shojo should be.  The characters are sincere funny and their relationships are loveable and endearing.  You will definately fall in love with Tomoe. No one can resist an adorable kitsune with long white hair!,15039,225,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I LOVED this anime and if you like romance that is hard in the beginning then you would like this anime.,15043,226,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really enjoyed this anime. It was very funny bright and romantic i really love tomoe and nanami. The music was so relaxing and japanesy i really like the characters especially tomoe nanami and mizuki. I strongly recommended that you should watch this,15045,227,2019-04-13 21:35:40

" Lupin III  is a franchise that has had its ups and downs but for the most part the master thief and his crew manage to pull off entertaining heists year after year most of which are at least somewhat memory. However one of the most indisputably excellent outings of the franchise was the theatrical feature  The Castle of Cagliostro  which is without a doubt one of my favorite films let alone Lupin films. So it only makes since that a TV special would try to curtail the greatness of that film in hopes of achieving at least half of what Miyazaki managed to. However referencing another work and in this case sometimes ripping it off wholesale does not make a new work automatically good. So it is with a heavy heart that I say the much-anticipated new special  Princess of the Breeze  is one of the weaker entries.",15067,231,2019-04-13 21:35:40

What Rec is is 7 little episodes that are half as long as a standard televisoin episode.  I saw this and decided that I wouldn't expect to much from this series in terms of things like plot and character development.  But boy was I wrong.  Not only did this series have as much development as standard series that runs anywhere between 11-26 episodes at 24 minutes apiece.  Seriously if nothing else I found this series to be a lot better than your standard romance drama series inpart because it was so short.  It had all the ups and downs that you would expect from a regular romance drama but without all the unnecessary things that usually causes those series to drag on and on.  Really there weren't that many problems that I had with the series.  I mean it wasn't a masterpiece by any means but still I did its job amazingly.  Probably the only real problem I had with the series was that it was over far to quickly though that's also one of the reasons I liked it.  If you're looking for a short and sweet romance drama then I would definitely recommend watching this.,15137,246,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Rec is a rather short adult romance anime with some comedy set in the world of business PR and voice acting. By adult romance I mean there is none of that trope highschool kid stuff just a couple of individuals who are brought together by work and more besides. This turned out to be unique and great. Don't judge a book by it's cover this is certainly true here. Initially I expected it to be generic trope-filled tat but turned out otherwise. This is the first anime in a good while that has had me glued to the screen it's actually quite interesting. There aren't too many great romance animes but this is one of the more unique and ineresting ones and should be commended for it. It's mostly sensible and not many things annoyed me so well done for that. It reminded me of decent romance anime like Please Teacher and Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien at times. Who is it aimed towards? I'm not really sure of that since it does have a rather grown-up storyline but is appears in a colourful youthful style. If you've enjoyed romance anime before or just like romance or unique stories give this a try. It's pretty short too 10 episodes at 13 minutes each.,15195,251,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The name  cat shit one  is there only to attract attention... in other words the anime is an attention whore. Naw I'm kidding the title isn't misleading because the anime takes a shit on over 1.000.000 people killed in the middle east... it's just japanese-style propaganda to justify american invaders it even portrays them as being righteous. It's  shit  like this that hides the truth how many of you know that americans cause cancer in the middle east because they use radioactive bullets? How many of you know that one of the Nazi generals a.k.a. Desert Fox preferred to take thousands and thousands of american prisoners instead of trying to kill them? That's right the Nazi were more merciful than these little  cute  rabbits. The only braincell active during the making of this anime was the one that said  hey usagi means rabbit in japanese... let's make U.S.A. troops into rabbits! . This kind of propaganda should be illegal and this is coming from a freedom-of-speech extremist promoter.,15291,260,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well this series seemed rather kiddy from the start. Their wars were  family friendly  the characters were all rather... fluffy and family friendly and things like that. The story was pretty cliched and not all that well exucuted. It had its moments but when there are multiple filler episodes in a single short season the pacing is obviously wrong. The characters were almost too nice to one another making it less believable. The animation was for parts of the series stunning... which is what makes the few episodes where it seemed like they gave up all the more striking. Episdes where most of the scenes were CGI still had HORRIBLE animation making it almost unbarable. The seiyuus weree almost all well known and were used well making it probably the only redeeming factor of this show. They had two of the best singer-seiyuus in the staff (Nana Mizuki and Horie Yui) and they did a good job taking advatage of this with inserts and a great OP. The characters were.... so cliched it hurt- for the most part. None of them were really memorable or overly likable. No characters were very well developed and the most well developed character was probably a secondary character that was the protagonist for a large portion of the series.,15359,268,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Critic’s Log - Earthdate: November 24 2013. Review #69: Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt,15487,287,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Panty and Stocking has a simple premise and the episodes stick fairly closely to them:,15489,288,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is a daring show produced by none other than the genius behind Gurren Lagann. A daring project in it's atmosphere concept and realisation. It parodies american cartoons such as Powerpuffs girls in a way never done before. It's audacity is unbelievable. It is hilarious beyond a doubt but it is not meant for everyone.,15505,289,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Honestly I have to give this anime a 10/10 (: I really enjoyed it and I've been wanting to watch it for a while to see what it was about. Sure there was a lot of perversion in it but the comedy in it and associated with it was hiliarous. I loved it and definitely enjoyed this anime. It is definitely not one for someone who doesn't like the perverse stuff but it is definitely a comical anime with great characters. I'm really sadd that it ended so short but also glad it didn't go on. The ending though xD ugh! But I did love everything about it and it is definitely on one of my favorite anime lists <3 ,15539,296,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Vulgar repellent disgusting. All words I have seen associated with this show. To those people I say grow a sense of humour. This show is vulgar and disgusting but in the most glorious way any show that has an episode dedicated to sperm trying to fertilise an egg portrayed in a similaqr style to Saving Private Ryan knows their comedy and knows it well. Yes this show is full of sex jokes fart jokes poop jokes and anything else in between but it does it so well in such an exaggerated style that it turns the ridiculousness of the whole thing in to pure comedy gold.,15545,298,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kannazuki no Miko (Destiny of the Shrine Maidens),15583,303,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It really sucked. Now one can't really tell from the first episode what the type of definitive genre will be a love story or a mecha battle history or something else. But really it was so cheesy its enough to leave you constipated for an entire year. It had pointless and endless talks talk talk talk about love or questioning why love or not knowing why love. Love really was the main moral of the story everything else just falls by the wayside. It really isn't an anime I would recommend unless your into sailor moon type stuff then you might like it. Wasn't good not at all but oh well I already saw it.,15591,304,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The plot is very much twisted. I wouldn't recommend it to people below 17 years of age bracket. The content is much mature to digest for minor i guess. The character designs are fine............story is some what regular about mecha and maidens. Don't hope too much from the plot. Sound is also fine. The story is more of a love triangle but i think is little bit of disturbing and not for everyone. If you are open with common gender love and affection then i guess there is no problem watching it.  ,15609,307,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Please note that wheneviewing this series I have thought of it WITHIN its timeframe. So ift seems to be rated highly to you it is because I am judging it forhe time it was made.,15653,314,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm going to start by the overall opinion about this anime: they took the first season's characters and they forgot about the (very few) good points that season had along with the reasons I actually wanted to watch this. What's left? 12 episodes of absolute boredom so-slow-kill-me-now pace and absolutely plain characters in absolutely plain places. I only finished watching it because I don't like to leave series unfinished. Not that I had any hope of this improving on its last episode.,15657,315,2019-04-13 21:35:40
well this overall score for me was a seven just letting u know that as a start but about the character and sound and yadi ya... i dont no to much and could care less about to me sound is the same sound is sound nothing more nothing less therefore to me sound in my perspective cannot be judge. but anyways on with the review well even though this i will admit it had a very poor story line it lack on it but regardless what it lack on it was still a nice and pretty good anime to watch i mean even tough it did not follow up with the main story plot most of the time just watching the others excuse me for my laugage but god knows what it was it was nice to see the random episodes thrown out there it was enjoyable episodes even though it was not suppouse to be in there but other than that just letting everyone no i have seen season 1 and 2 of this episodes and it turn out to be a really good anime for me i mean i have watch so many romance anime and this one going to be in should be remember as only because it had a very how do i say this with out sounding like a girl here it was rather intruging how those two couple handle there realtion ship but if u want me to get to the poin read this and ill rate this normally i only rate this from 1-5 5 being the highest but here its a 1-10 -_- so yea,15663,316,2019-04-13 21:35:40

She is so young yet so wise well she isnt wise she is quite obnoxious and actually after leaving the floating castle after a disaster over 100years ago taking with her the Lord of fire and wisdom..I guess she aint young either. Anyway this particular story shows the maturing of the flame Haze Shana and the Midnight lost child whom every magician and his demon are after. Its cute fun and makes you feel for the protagonists. I like it its good from every angle look it up,15795,338,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I came into Shakugan no Shana without much in the way of high hopes. I planned for it to be an  in-between  anime while I waited for the next volume of Code Geass to ship. To my great surprise however Shakugan no Shana turned out to be a decent anime.,15807,339,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime really touches on emotions.  A nice blend of fighting story some comedy and romance aspect. The fights are quite interesting and what seems like a cross of magic/dark arts. The romance aspect is bound to hit people based on who you cheer for or just hoping for something to happen but it doesn't. This part became frustrating to watch and the season ending without the one thing happening I was waiting to see happen all season.,15809,340,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Myself; Yourself starts off sounding like any school life anime that appears to be pretty predictable. However there is always some suspense or interesting.character arc to keep you interested. It takes infuriating long to find out some of the secrets they continue to hint about but everything all comes together nicely at the end. This series has likeable characters that are well developed considering it is only 13 episodes long. For it being classified as a tragedy it has a very happy and satisfying conclusion. For fans of Key's works or drama romances this is a very good anime.,15839,346,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Буду краток. Концовка шикарная я проникся. Изначально решил что аниме очередной проходняк но что-то держало меня. И как оказалось не зря. Хотя с жестью авторы переборщили. Отдельно стоит отметить крутой совершенно не характерный для данного типа произведения ендинг и скрипку в сцене с признанием у почтового ящика. В общем если вы хотите посмотреть легкую любовную историю и не боитесь небольшого жесткача то рекомендую к просмотру.   ,15841,347,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Myself; Yourself is a 13 episode slice-of-life romance anime. If you aren’t new to my reviews you should know I do not enjoy the bloated and uninteresting harem/ecchi genres. So my expectations were low. Early on it was uninteresting and the fan-service started to sneak in. And then out again as the anime got quite serious. It wasn’t a harem like it seemed to be at first and shit just got real in a good way. However was this too little too late?,15873,354,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series starts out being an extremely average love story doing absolutely nothing worth noting (nor even remembering) for the first third or so of the series. Kid moves back into a childhood town meets old friends tries to reestablish bonds with said friends etc. etc. However after that part of the series is out of the way After this point (and all the subsequent face palming done during these first few episodes whilst wondering why you bother to continue this series) they start to throw interesting story arcs at you giving you a new feel and understanding for each of the characters in the story. At this point unfortunately the average viewer will have lost most of their will to continue/care overly about any of the characters. If you are still going by this point you will be somewhat surprised with the story and able to enjoy the unusual themes that are explored in this series which is what truly sets it apart from most other love/comedy series.,15881,357,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Dennou Coil is an anime I recommend. I really can't see why it didn't get better reviews. Maybe because it isn't flashy and superficial. The setting is extremely good the pacing and narration are good as well. The characters are normal 10 year old kids - and they generally behave as such. There is a satisfying ending and you're not left guessing as to why things happen because the inner workings of the world are explained: it's coherent and consistent. So yes in my opinion it's a likeable anime and a nice watch.,15911,364,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Astroby 1963 is not to bad for a black and white cartoon. Gives a nice futuristic touch but at the same time it could of been better. Wasn't a huge fan of it.,16131,401,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Here we have it folks the single most influential anime of all-time! it's kinda funny because it looks nothing even close to anything coming out nowadays. Astroboy helped developed anime in so many ways from the sci-fi genre episodic shows common anime features still used to this day: (enlarged eyes round features shading ect.). But still even though it did help shape the eastern animation style in a big way Astroboy actually drew very little on traditional japanese styles; from the Disney-ish art style to the avant-garde sci-fi nuance's of the 1927 classic Metropolis Astroboy ends up with this strange mix between childish inocents and harsh reality. The show doesn't suger coat much of anything actually sometimes the reality can be a little to harsh for poor little Astro but threw it all he plays the perfect little boy scout always doing the right thing and trying to save the day. While it may look dated compared to the latest Madhouse show Astroboy was a ground breaking innovative and ahead of its time masterpiece that is still a blast to watch 50+ years down the line. ,16143,402,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Honestly the characters were pretty alright in this. Your common anime harem girls with a lot of meta jokes thrown in. The only problem with this Ep0 is that it is literally non stop fanservice. I get that was the point which the meta jokes point out. But it was just too much. The real episodes are much better so far. Don't judge the anime based on this. At least not yet.,16149,403,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ok the plot isn't deep or overly emotional I'll grant that. But if you want a fun and simple feel good time then Gourmet Girl Graffiti is wonderful. The mix of good food and friendship is just warm and welcoming and the simplicity of everything is good to relax to. I can't wait to read the manga.,16233,414,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is better than it looks even though the first episode is quite slow. It follows the life of a girl who loves to cook becoming closer to her cousin who loves to eat after her cousin decides to attend cram school in Tokyo. The plot is very simple but if you have any interest in Japanese culture and cuisine or even discovering a new recipe I recommend you to watch it. If you aren't too familiar with Japanese cuisine this anime will certainly be educational. The anime really did well at making everything seem appetizing and watching the two girls enjoy different meals is entertaining especially when the animation focuses on their reactions- everything becomes sparkly and glossy especially their lips and eyes. It seems quite unusual to have fanservice just based on their reactions but it's tasteful and amusing to see. Every episode has a certain dish that she wants to cook and we follow the instructions and recipes with her. The pacing of the anime is quite slow the first few episodes are quite weak and probably not enough to make people want to finish the show. I feel that one of the biggest problems is that the main character Ryou is quite bland and although it's difficult to dislike anyone in the show it's also really hard to find anyone loveable. The backgrounds are really well animated and the patterns on the clothes are quite eye catching. I think anyone interested in Japanese culture and cuisine would really enjoy this. And make sure not to watch this show when hungry it can be a painful experience.,16239,415,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Chugging along to my next community review for Anime-Planet and coming in at number 17. This train is not stopping anytime soon – at all. In this review I am taking a look at the episode long OVA called Cat Soup. No spoilers or cursing as usual. Check out my other reviews. I welcome comments and criticism or reviews of my review. Thanks for reading and on with the review of this abstract and strange anime!,16241,416,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Not sure how to rate this (tried giving it a  ?  for a score but the site wouldn't let me). Oddly compelling work. Reminded me of so many things (Dali What Dreams May Come with cats Tim Burton David Lynch Doom Generation the -qatsi films by Godfrey Reggio with Philip Glass music) but still maintaned a sense of originality. Often beautiful backgrounds strange companions and bizarre people met along the way and so much quirkiness. I found myself often laughing and even more often confused. Plan to watch it again and maybe even share it with some people. Just an odd little thing I could come to love or at least admire. Definitely not for everyone.,16253,420,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Cat Soup can be summed up as  What the *%@$ . The art is odd-ball and bizzaro there's no dialogue no script hardly any developed characters (Strange ones at that) and that's not even touching the  plot .,16255,421,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have two main issues with slice-of-life shows: Most have extremely boring/over-used settings (some sort of school or a house/neighborhood but always in upper middle-class modern-day Japan) and have a cast almost exclusively made up of cute teenaged girls. Because of this I find most slice-of-lifes stagnant and/or derivative.,16371,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you read other peoples’ comments about this anime youill find them relating it to another anime ‘K-ON!’. The only thing that theyave in common is the story involves five girls and has a musical theme. Howeverhat is where the similarities end here half the girls are involved in music; withne of them learning whilst ‘K-ON!’ has all five.,16377,440,2019-04-13 21:35:40

           Having watched the first one I have to say that the sequel was lacking. While the animation generally stayed strong I found the plot incredibly predictable. Not to mention that the main character was amped up a bit too much in order to fit into certain character types. Mostly she came off as just plain idiotic and selfish compared to the first time where she was a much more of a loveable goofy character that had at least a little awareness of her surroundings. Of course she does redeem herself towards the end when she gets to tackling her goals.,16395,445,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I put off watching this movie for the longest time! I am so glad I finally got around to watching it! It made me laugh out loud a number of times and cry too! Family friendly for sure. The goblins are so funny and Momo really grows throughout the movie. Her relationship with her mother grows too! The ending is very sweet and makes you wish it were real. Make sure you watch with loud sound because the smallest goblin is hard to hear and it is important to hear him.  Also notice his doodle! Everything he does and says has a deeper meaning/reason. I love that the biggest one pushes her in over and over! ENJOY! :),16399,447,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Straight from my blog!!!,16405,448,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A really funny ecchi series with many incest jokes. The first few episodes are the best and after that it gets a little stale but it is still good.,16415,449,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I want to break up this movie into multiple pieces. The movie itself is very simple. The idea behind it is quite brilliant though. The two main characters while generic in a lot of ways have a great dynamic. The flow is good. It gives you time to feel comfortable and then throws you into the darkest parts of the realm. Other than a few exceptions Patema's friend for example the side characters were extremely underdeveloped. The music is somewhat bland. It works at times but then other times it seems very out of place. Even though with all these minute flaws piling up it's overall enjoyment is higher than I expected. It cleans up nicely and gives you a full entertaining ride.,16417,450,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,16419,451,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Patema Inverted delivers an original and thought provoking premise (something sorely needed in anime right now.)  Ideally something as cool as a universe with gravity gone awry could be used as a mechanism to facilitate action and some serious hard sci-fi.  Patema however uses it as a vehicle to create a stark contrast between the world perspectives of the protagonists.  I don't mean to say that's wrong in fact it does this exceedingly well.  However it does so while ignoreing the physical realities of such a situation and adds one bungled detail on top of another right up to the end. ,16434,452,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let's start by saying that overall plot is interesting and as soon you realise who are the  bad  guys and  good  guys you can have established feelings towards one and another of course there are some holes if you are talking about  phisycs... ,16436,453,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Cela fesait presque un an que je n'avais pas autant ris devant une serie. Le thème de cet anime est assez spécial mais tout à fait adapté pour ce genre de comédie. J'apprecie le coté moe übber Kawaïi de certains personnages et l'innexistance de fan service qui aurais sûrment transformé cette oeuvre en une einième sortie ecchi sans aucune nouveautés.,16490,466,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While it didn't have much depth(character or plot-wise) Oreimo is a touching story about sibling love. Lighthearted and humorous the story of incredibly normal Kyouske and his too-perfect sister(with a bad attitude) Kirino was oddly compelling. There's a lot of things that could have been done better but the heart of the story was (mostly) innocent sugar-coated sweetness and that's really what fluff is all about right?,16498,467,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gundress is another anime that introduces the future.   The plot is simple and not too well thought out.  Some scenes seem disjointed rather than telling a continuous story.  Like other older anime you can see ideas that will be more fully developed in later titles.  The basic design of the mecha harkens to the later Appleseed units.  Most abvious the twin pair of arms.  If you are looking for a solid watch but not too mentally challenging this will be time well spent.  If you enjoy seeing where modern anime came from this is a must see.,16568,486,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The year is 2100. An all female GiTS squad equiped withppleseed biped armor suits are ordered to protect an Arabian arms smugglerrom a long white haired GiTS terrorist.

This anime feels more like a slice of life anime than a romance anime. The story is basically the main character's day by day activities in high school which is typical of slice of life animes. I did not see any romance develop until after half of the season. Even then it is very soft romance. I was surprised to find that this anime is labeled as a comedy. Even though I did laugh a couple of times I found this anime to be serious and not that funny. I did enjoy the array of unique characters but they were put in arguably boring situations. This is a filler anime only watch it if there is nothing better to watch >:].,16574,489,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the best RomCom anime that I'm currently addicted to although there isn't any progress on the relationships of the protagonist reality was clearly point out on the story At first I was amused on how Hachiman views life his weird look poor socializing and high presence among the other character although he tries his best to stay invisible but for me Yukinoshita drawns a lot more attention in the story she's very mysterious albeit she and Hachiman has almost the same perspective on socializing she's popular.,16576,490,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story does look more like romanric-drama.comnedies are hidden mostly with the interaction of leads insulting each other.,16586,491,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'll be honest I only watched half of the first episode but that was more than enough: wierd looking sexed up school uniforms with every character being just the same pretty girl with different hair and a ridiculous contrived plot with a protagonist just asking for every self-pitying loner to project themselves onto. Not to mention the obligatory truck load of anime cliches and zero self-awareness. Dress it all up with some decent animation and wait for the money to roll in. If this is where anime is headed count me out.,16590,492,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is good although it has it's flaws. The characters are unique well expressed and animated. The sound is alright though I find that less important. But now comes the problem.

I feel Bobobo gets a lot of undue criticism and a little undue praise. Bobobo is pretty much a show with one purpose: to be as surreal as possible. At least this is the case in the English translation. I imagine that in Japanese it uses a tonne of puns that don't translate or something. The story pretty much only exists as a framework for the bizarre interactions between the characters - to me this seems to be what puts most people off. However if you watch it with an open mind it really is funny with some moments that are pure gold! I recall one episode that was almost entirely Bobobo and Don Patch (practically his sidekick) roleplaying as if they were a husband and wife with marital problems. Obviously they end up doing all kinds of impossible things...,16740,527,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Awesome show from start to finish. It has a surprisingly good story for a silly show and i enjoyed seeing every episode. Taking down an empire doesn't sound original but somehow it was awesome. First they take down  block leaders  which are each given a title like  A-block  leader. Then they have to defeat the big four and then someone named giga. Later they Bald Bowl starts and all the characters you thought were dead come back and compete to become the next leader of the empire. Doesn't sound great but its presented in such an awesome way,16742,528,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime in my words was one of my favorite because it has all the wow factors an aime should have it also leaves questions like will it have a second seasons because it really does need one !!!!! the manga is also really good and i suggest you read it because it does explain a few things that the anime does not give away :),16748,530,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A typical MMO-style anime. The story is not bad at all even though quite generic. Not many memorable characters. Ends in the middle of the plotline. One of the better MMO anime of 2012.,16752,531,2019-04-13 21:35:40
**spoilers**,16754,532,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As a whole the series is very average the characters are somewhat interesting but only shows the bare minimum of there backstory the story itself isn't too bad it's been done before but this  was quite a good development of itself but nothing is really standout. The main problem I had was the ending.... It doesn't have one it just cuts off and shows nothing more even though they talked about there plan it annoyed me most because it was just starting to develop the two main characters and then it just cuts off. Visually it looks good decent artwork and animation its good quality but it just doesn't show enough of the characters and seemed like it could of been a lot better if it had shown some kind of conclusion. Overall it's not a bad series its enjoyable for what it is I wouldn't recommend it but if you have some spare time it's worth the watch.,16756,533,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie has the same general plot/feel as a Godzilla movie but with a bit of detective mystery thrown in. It is a side story to the Patlabor series and takes place in between the frist and second movies. And from not having watched any of the ova's series or movies before watching this(i will soon though!) i will go ahead and say that this movie should be considered a stand alone story within the patlabor franchise since the charcaters from the show/ova's/moives didnt make an appearance until the ending.So im not sure how fans of the series will take this movie. But seeing it with the stand alone point of view it was definatly a good choice for a pizza and a movie night.,16912,574,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm not going to go into detail about this movie. The animation was nice for it's time so I can't complain and the sound really fit. The story barely made it until the end. I like the set up even the minimal back story given to Sawa but for the most part this was nothing but sex and killing. I gave it a five because it wasn't horrible but it could have been a great deal better.,16970,583,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm a huge fan of fantasy stories because of the setting I like small towns near mountains or hills and all that stuff and I guess that's the main reason why I like this show so much.

When I was little I've seen about 3-4 episodes of this anime and I loved it. Then when I had no anime to watch I said to watch this one. From thevery first episode I fell in love with it! The story is very good I cried at it. The animation is great the battles are just epic! I just love how Edward is short and he gets bullied by it it adds a bit of comedy. Overall this anime has a special place in my heart but I won't say what place it gets because choosing from animes is like choosing from your own children. It's a must see.,17080,597,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had thought about spending a good portion of this review writing a rant about why I dislike Fullmetal Alchemist such much.  But being the fair minded individual I am I decided not to. Sure I have to give credit where the show deserves it.  The story though it stopped completely following the manga was still fairly good for what it was.  The mixture of comedy action and mystery kept the show for the most part somewhat interesting.  The animation was really good with a good mixture of forms to keep things from every looking overly repetitive.  Backgrounds character designs and color usage were are rather nice as well.  The soundtrack that played throughout was nice and always seemed to be able to fit the scene prefectly as well as containing a variety of pieces that prevented it from ever sounding like the soundtrack was on a loop or something.  Though I will say that I found the intros and endings to be rather bad and didn't like them in the slighest bit.  All the characters developed extremely well and while I just plain did not like some of the characters especially some of the main characters they were all still fairly interesting.,17090,601,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely love this anime.  It`s hard to find an anime that will keep my interest for that long.  Considering that the series is I believe to be over 50 episodes it kept my interest throughout and it always got more exciting.  I loved the fact there was the thrill factor in it most of the time and I liked that they had some warm moments to soften the sadness within the series.  Can`t forget some of the comedy/humour that was in it.  I found that the story flowed really well.  All in all one amazing series.,17092,602,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of the best series ends ever. However if ya still wanted more then it can be found easily in the conqueror of Shambala.

Love it or hate it there is no denying the impact of the anime Fullmetal Alchemist. As one of the decade's most popular shows it has introduced countless people to the amazing world of Japanese animation. For this I tip my hat to the series despite some of its issues. I also will admit up front that my first exposure to Fullmetal Alchemist was its reimagined counterpart Brotherhood. As my all-time favorite piece of entertainment EVER I am forced to admit that it likely influenced my perceptions and views of the original. With that established lets dive into the interesting world of Fullmetal Alchemist.,17113,607,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Before I read the manga and before I watched FMAB I watched this. When I finished this series I thought about NOT watching Brotherhood. Honestly nothing could top this one for me after so I almost didn't give anything else a try. At 54 episodes this one was the longest anime I'd seen yet. Yes there were some filler eps in the middle that weren't really moving the story along but the overall arc was so strong nothing mattered but what was going to happen to Ed and Al. I loved every character in this. All of the Homunculi were evil in their own way (Lust being my fav in this a particular series) and i lovedddd Mustang (duh) and Hughes among others. I will delve into more of the pros and cons between the two versions in my brotherhood review but I'll leave you with this...,17127,611,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is an overall excellent anime and i would recomend that anyone watch it. It shows that  anyone can do anything if they really wanted to and if they have heart. There is not one thing i would change if i could because it was so well thought out and planned to the very end. Everything that happened happened for a reason.

Every character in FMA goes through hard times and develop as people. This combined with the music is the entire anime in my opinion. If you've heard of FMA you might be wondering  what is the point of watching such a gloomy anime? . Despite of the amounts of effort the characters put into achieving their goals the reality of the world in FMA hits them right in the face kind of like reality hits most of us in our real lives. However that adds to the story and the charater developement because this anime is just as much about trying to find light in the darkness and never giving up. The soundtrack is great and filled with variation. These two things make the anime worth watching despite of the downsides to it which I wont go into. FMA is not bad. I approve.,17209,626,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Edward gets automail (metal) limbs to replae his lost ones. At the age of 12 he decides to enlist in the state military as a State Alchemist so he can obtain the philosopher's stone so the brother's can return to their natural bodies. As they start their journey to obtain the  fabled  philosopher's stone they have no idea more loss angst and evil is in store for them.

When it comes to this show it seems the only way to not compare it to Brotherhood is to not watch Brotherhood. It seems like most people want to pick a side between the original and Brotherhood. A lot of people actually originally told me just to watch Brotherhood but I felt the need to watch both and compare. I'm really glad I did because honestly rather than pick one or the other I wish I could pick and choose elements of both and Frankenstein together my own cut of these shows. So I'm going to both try to review it as its own entity while also comparing and contrasting to Brotherhood.,17221,632,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Fullmetal Alchemist is from Studio BONES and based off the manga from Hiromu Arakawa. It was already a very famous work even before its airing on Cartoon Network's [adult swim] block in late 2004 which is where I had heard of it first. This anime is known for being a gateway show for loads of people and for good reason it's a very engaging show.,17247,637,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Persona 3 the movie  is based on a game and it's easy for us to say that game is better because this and that and blah blah blah... But it's not fair because it's very different from a game in few ways - 1 is that you're not the main character ( girl/guy) You don't get to make decisions do romance study and stuff.  It's a movie which tries really hard and brings a lot of fun.,17259,640,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Amazing Nuts! It's one of many anime by Studio 4C. Honestly i love artworks and mystical story. If you want to se something crazy and coloristic - you made right way when opened this page.,17397,669,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just a little above what I expected from Studio 4C. The plot is quite unclear as it only depicts two lovers running away from the world. Having to deal with the lady's  enemy of the world  status the confused male eventually gives the relationship up. I'd recommend watching Amazing Nuts! if you've got 10 minutes to spare although you could probably find much better animes out there to spend those 10 precious minutes.,17403,670,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've decided to be brave and write this review.  Brave  because I'm going to go against the common opinion and say that I didn't find this movie touching or captivating at all. That's it I said it. Really I don't understand why it got so many positive reviews. I can't count the times I fell asleep trying to watch it. It's extremely slow-paced. But that isn't why I'm rating it low. The reason is that I just didn't see anything worthwhile in it. Simply put: it's boring. Surely it's my fault for not getting it. ,17443,679,2019-04-13 21:35:40

‘Beyond the Clouds’ also known as ‘The Place Promised in Our Early Days’ is a movie by Makoto Shinkai. I wanted to watch It for some months and when I finally found It I wasn’t been disappointed. It’s just masterpiece. Catching plot strong characters awesome animation and a kind of mystery – It has it all. Maybe people’s animation is not that perfect but I’ve never seen any anime with more beautiful landscapes. And as I know not everybody likes Sci Fi I wasn’t the exception. But thanks to (or because of) Beyond the Clouds I changed my mind.,17485,690,2019-04-13 21:35:40
 I found this movie to be precious gem that should be treated as the masterpiece it is yes i would like to get more information about lots of things and some aspects could have been more developed but i belive it to be beautifu lthe way it is.,17487,691,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There's this one scene (Or segment) in the movie where Sayuri picks up a violin and plays it. Along with the imagery the sheer beauty of both music and visuals made me weep. The only other time I came close to weeping (Sounds better than crying in this case) was with another violin but that first example really got me. But that's not to say that they're the only good looking or good sounding scenes as this movie is absolutely gorgeous and a feast for both the eyes and the ears. It may possibly be the most beautiful film I have ever seen as of yet. It's just gorgeous segment after gorgeous segment. I fear to know the budget on this.,17489,692,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Obscure Bizarre Oddly exciting. This isn't one archetypical thing at all; it's not just the gore or the low budget animation that makes sex scenes grossly disturbing although entertaining that makes you doubt to conclude the film as you're watching it it's the plot itself; As many traumas as one can get the main character depicts everything that's wrong with modern society. This is a challenging psychological thriller I even couldn't call it a gory one because what hits you the most are it's themes; ultraviolence with the mundane ambience a story of a psychopath so natural that you can even identify with the character if you or anybody close to you has been through his kind of situation. ,17573,708,2019-04-13 21:35:40

gotta defend this one maybe it was the slight harem they implemented or the U.S stealth mechs but this anime was watchable and never bored me. What got me is in the beggining the characters that where supposed to be the main ones get killed off from there i got hooked. needed tp know what happened next. this anime aint no grounbreaker but i would buy the dvds and wouldnt regret it(this is from someone who buys clothes at the salvation army).,17637,721,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It was kind of hard to rate the story animation and what not because of the age of this OVA but that aside I did sort of enjoy this. By  sort of  what I really mean is I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. It was good enough to keep my attention but the ending left me feeling a little unsatisfied. There's not really much else to say about it. If you want a prime example of a guy acting like a giant dick then this is perfect for you. If you'll get angry about it I'd avoid this. Also again if you're looking for a nice clear ending I wouldn't look at this either.,17667,730,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I didn't expect much from this anime but I decided to give it a try. This anime that wants to be like Cowboy Bebop and I thought Wendy would be alright but she is too annoying and weak. She is the cliche annoying sidekick who clings to Van. I don't think I can watch anymore since Wendy was too annoying for me. She is clingy like a little kid.,17669,731,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had a blast watching this anime. I really liked it it was an old west type deal anime but only in the environment for some reason it doesn't give off so much gun action as opposed to the mecha action. And the  entrance  that has to be done each the giant robot comes out doesn't really wear you down as opposed to other entrances or transformations like digimon frontier. Van is a badass and Wendy is so awesome. It really helps to kill some time. I'd recommend it if your looking for the type of anime with a journey where a character must discover himself to save himself.,17675,734,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So the first episode draws you in like any other anime's first episode would but then it takes a wierd turn. The next two or three episodes are just plain silly and they kinda make you consider stopping this anime nd moving on to something else but if you can power through to the main story it gets really good. Overall it has a slow start but i gotta say I was pretty pleased with it in the end.,17689,739,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a different kind of story but a good one. First of all I really liked the opening and closing themes. It's pure and real western and they are damn good. The lazy style of the hero is very western and that style is consistent throughout the series. ,17693,740,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you want to talk about anime of the year Aldnoah.Zero is definetly included in the list. From the first episode Aldnoah.Zero pulls the viewers in amazing animation and stunning music. Like seriously Aldnoah.Zero give you the impression that you are watching a movie every episode. The main character Inaho is perfect as his cool and calculated personality fits extremely well with this anime focused on a war between planets. The other main character Slain is just as good and it's easy to tell that a fierce face off between these two is fate. Drop everything and watch this! I gave it a 5/5 rating as well. ,17731,752,2019-04-13 21:35:40

" We knew that your barrier had gaps. Ground contact surfaces for instance. You can’t up a barrier under your feet. If you did your wouldn't be able to stand. The very invincibility of your barrier makes it impossible to completely cover yourselves in it. The receiver for your external cameras. That’s one of your barrier’s gaps. -Kaizuka Inaho (This is how genius he is!)",17739,754,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Aldnoah Zero is a frustrating but ultimately enjoyable ride. It's world is tantalisingly underdeveloped what's there is definitely above average but it could have been something really great. The story (and particularly ending) is best described as shakespearean. It's also cool having one of the main characters outsmart his opponents but not be the typical weakling like in other anime. The fights feel grounded and realistic despite being all mostly mecha. Not many laughs but not everything can be comedy. Defiantly worth a look.,17741,755,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Having to write a review about Aldnoah Zero means that its good and the plot was not well written. Yes i'm being bias of course but intellect and mystery is what makes this anime interesting for me.,17745,757,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I gave the story a 1 because of the horrible ending. This was as disappointing an ending as you will ever see in an anime. It made the whole series a waste of time to watch.,17753,760,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think Spanish zero was a very particular anime it's one that I've never seen before so I was very eager to watch it. The show was ok it was good but one thing I don't like about it was the ending like I was really to the screen but when I saw two of the get shot I threw my phone in the ground and said I am done. I was like what just happened but other then that part the anime was really good :D,17785,762,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Aldnoah Zero at the beginning of a very to my liking . Mecha were well worked out in terms of technical and fights were pretty spectacular. The story of the former to me at certain times and challenging for the hero himself seemed to me devoid of feeling as if he was a serial killer . 7/10 gives this anime since the last episode of the anime was devoid of any meaning.,17791,764,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was a realy good anime. It had a really good story line to it but sometimes it was a little hard to follow with how fast things progress in this anime. This anime had some good animation to it. The characters and the scernaire had some good details to them. The sound in this anime was good for the most part. It had some really good songs in it epsically during the battle scences. Also I liked the opening and ending songs they went a long with they anime very well. Most of the characters where very awesome. I liked most of the main characters because of the type of personality that they have.

A good but not a great Mecha anime.,17819,768,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What can I say about this anime? Being farely new to the mecha genre of anime I wasn't quite sure just what it was that I was getting myself into upon watching Aldnoah Zero. I wasn't disappointed to say the least. Every episode had something new to add to the story some new element that would just make everything stick together. ,17821,769,2019-04-13 21:35:40
spoilers ahead! I was so impressed by this anime.  I stay away from mechas as a rule but I fell in love with the soundtrack when I heard it on 8 tracks and decided to watch the first episode.  It's exceedingly rare to find an anime that has good animation good music AND a good story. I get real nervous watching an anime that has great animation or music because they always end up being dumb stories.  It's as if the studio just made the anime as a portfolio piece or only cared about getting people intrigued enough to watch but just didn't care about the actual story! Aldnoah Zero has everything.  Maybe its greatest strength is its two main characters.  Both Inaho and Slaine are fascinating to watch and I felt endeared to both of them right away.  When they start working together in the one episode is when I decided that this anime was awesome without a doubt.  They have a very intriguing relationship and one of the animes biggest tragedies is that they were not able to become allies because there is no doubt they would have been fast friends under a different world.  I felt that the fight scenes were some of the most engaging I've seen.  The final episode I think may have been meant to be the finale of the story and if it were I would have been satisfied.  It was a very tragic story at its core.  Such a simple thing caused so much suffering.  If the princess had just been able to make a 2 minute phone call none of it would have happened.  If Slaine had been able to get to the princess after he teamed up with Inaho none of it would have happened.  So many things were  so close  in this anime and it made it a tragedy.  It reminds me of an ending to Steven King's 'The Mist' where everyone dies which was supposed to be the ending to Attack on Titan.  The one thing that is keeping me from giving it a 10 is the little side stories they tried to create.  The PTSD and the martian girl stories did not work for me.  I thought they were a little cheesy and a waste of everyones time.  It took away from the integrity of the great show they created.  ,17823,770,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I rated it 7/10 in story because I will actually recommend it to someone (a 6 for me means that I won't personally recommend it even though I've watched it a few times). The story's definitely not perfect but it's charming and unique in its own way in a serious and prompt way as is what most anime nowadays aren't. It's pretty difficult to explain but the rivalry between the two of the major roles in the story certainly contributed to that score I gave for the story. Also the ending was interesting in a way that it will give you mixed emotions and contrasting opinions depending on what perspective you're viewing it.,17825,771,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara No Kyoukai is a series where Ryouga Shiki deals with so called investigations with the help of Aozaki Mikiya and Azaka through supernatural powers gore and suspense. This one however is an exception due to the fact that the character focus only narrows down through two characters who have the ability to foresee future called precognition (Shizune Seo and Mitsuru Kamekura) making the original cast side characters due to being a side story. ,17849,777,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin is a solid film. The artwork is top notch the story is interesting the characters are well rounded and all in all it is an enjoyable experience. It is also the proper epilogue of the Kara no Kyoukai series as opposed to the so-called epilogue which is just a bunch of philosophical musings in a pretty wrapping. But most of all this can more or less stand on its own which is a necessity for any movie. Prior viewing of the series (or at least the fifth and seventh installations) will add a bit more depth to it though.,17855,778,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The animation is pretty and even though everytime they introduce a new female character (with few exceptions) their bust size increases from the last female character they have a decent array of characters. The soundtrack is pretty standard but matches the show pretty well. The first episode or two had me pretty excited for a badass medieval storyline with a hint of magic however watching the following episodes I was incredibly bored with the lack of motive behind all of the fighting. Characters go from being friendly during the day and the next night they'll have an all out war killing each others' soldiers and horses (holy shit a lot of horses die!) they then act all friendly again and completely forgive/forget all the soldiers (AND HORSES!) they just lost. The show showed potential and then just bored me to tears I gave up after painfully making it through episode 6. For how badass the first episode was it became way too casual and lacks a storyline. The only way I could reccomend this show to someone is if all they cared about were massive breasts with shirts that appears to be painted on and the occasional nudity with hair/light/bushes/etc. covering the naughty bits.,17879,783,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ignore the haters that watch it with a grudge against light novel inpired anime. This series is amazing and interesting. While I do admit that the war maidens outfits are a little more revealing than they could be and it is a little cliche to have them all fall for the main character but besides that the characters are all lovable and the thought out war pieces with their great animation and well thoughtout strategy makes the whole thing fun to watch,17887,784,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First of all allow me to state that this review is based on the dubbed version of Dark Cat.  I'm sure the original Japanese version of Dark Cat is better than the dubbed version but I've only seen the dubbed version.  Since I can only review what I've seen the score I give to this anime will apply only to the dub version.  Besides I'm pretty sure the other reviews on Anime-Planet cover the subbed version with the original Japanese audio; so it's about time for somebody on this site to review the dubbed version.,17951,798,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The entire first season of code geass in a single movie. Do not watch this if you haven't finished at least the first season of code geass yet. The movie has no new animation and is mostly just reused matirial. Exept for some narration. This movie is ideal for the people that liked code geass and want to relive the epicness without having to watch the entire anime again. Or prehaps for people that want a reminder of the first season before starting the second season.,17953,799,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wouldn't recommend Mai Mai Miracle to people who hate movies that are strong on nostalgia. I think Clarence is a better one for you. I don't think I even like movies about a third grader but this one is quite hard to like anyway. The characters' short heights were annoying. The voice acting is perfect and so is the animation.,17955,800,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,17981,809,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This one ends up as the lowest ranked of the three seasons. It is still very entertaining to watch primarily if you love action and lots of fight scenes. This season loses the charm that the first two had by giving barely any screen time to many characters that we knew well from the first two seasons. The school / daily life theme vanishes as every episode after the first six is pretty consistant fighting.,17983,810,2019-04-13 21:35:40
WORST SEASON EVER. Right from the beginning nothing in this third season makes sense. Nothing from the previous seasons suggested any of the new events. The change in the main character doesn't make sense. I don't care what they claim the reason to be the fact is in the situation they described it is highly unlikely that there would be such a dramatic change in him. I'm a psych major and I'm telling you right now nothing from the previous seasons suggested his character would ever change like that in such a situation. Not to mention the change in him is lame and annoying. I just want to punch the kid a hundred times everytime he showed up on my screen. Alot of the events were just confusing and hard to keep up with too. I just kept clicking the next episode button because I felt obliged to see it till the end not because I actually wanted to watch it. Technically I turned it off a few episodes before finishing it. I just couldn't take it anymore and that's just sad. I can't say this show was ever very good and it certainly didn't meet my expectations. It was hard to get in to and stay in to since the beginning of season one. It had it's interesting moments and it had a lot of moments where I just couldn't get interested in it at all. The animation is great but the story and characters need some help. With this third season though it's beyond hope. There is no redemption in my opinion.,17985,811,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well I guess this movie wasn't that bad. It had good animation the pacing was nice and brisk and the girls were given the ecchi treatment (their breasts flying around as if this were an episode of High School DXD or Ikkitousen). However it falls short ultimately with the removal of some important pieces to the story that were beneficial to the series (ex. the removal of Ace). It gave off the feeling that something was missing and fails to deliver. Had this been more faithful to the series it would've been better but it falls short.,18005,817,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love the Gundam universe. Particularly series that take place in the Universal Century or U.C. for the Otaku. Storyline is amazing. So well constructed.

I can't tell you how much I enjoy reading sports manga and watching sports related shows. I was also a competitive swimmer way back in highschool so when I saw that an anime was coming out about SWIMMING?! Oh yeah I just had to watch it. Right from the get go I was mortified the first episode was pretty much showing off the 'eye candy' cast and establishing the background that sets up the premise of Free! It was a major struggle to get through most of it but I made it through and here I am to tell the world about it.,18053,826,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While the show may come off as fanservice it is more than that. Free! has great characters and justifys the fan service as it is a show about swimming. I felt that the characters developed pretty well and went from being eye candy to guys we could all relate to in a way. The animation is amazing! Kyoto animation has mangaed to put out another visually stunning show with a great story to back it up. The soundtrack for Free! is also great and touching. ,18055,827,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright this review is a little bit difficult for me.  I am going to come out and say that this anime is one of my favorites.  In my heart of hearts I really love this show.  However to be fair as a reviewer I want to give everyone else a realistic idea of the positives and negatives of this show; not just a fan spouting about how much she loves it. So let’s dive right in (I couldn't resist and I apologize.),18061,828,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Free! Iwatobi Swim Club is definitely an anime you'll swoon over if you're a fujoshi.  I personally enjoyed some of the characters.  Though I thought the animation was a little off they're muscles drawn a tad bit too big I did like the style a few of the tournaments were drawn in. I did find a few flaws with the show however.  It leads you to believe the anime will be mainly about swimming when the story actually focuses more on the characters situations and relationships with each other.  Altogether though the voice actors did a wonderful job there's plenty of fanservice to enjoy and lots of cute boys to ship together.  If you're all about great funny cute boy characters Free! is 100% the show you want to be watching.,18081,831,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really liked this anime because it had a good story line to it and it didn't go off into a lot of different side stories it mostly stayed on one main idea and I really liked that. I love most of the characters in this anime because they are really awesome people and they all look so good when they are swimming. The animation of this anime is really good becasue it has amazing details in it. ,18085,833,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's not bad if you want fanserves in the form of half naked boys. If you want good characters and plot thisis not your place. Now for those of you have already seen it I need to intraduse you too 50% off. It's a parode and it will have you laughing for hours. Just try it. Here is episode 2. Episode 1 is boring so I skipped it. Warning: do not wach if you get easily offended by gay jokes. ,18087,834,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love Free! This anime is great for various reasons despite a lot of people referring to as 'fanservice'. I actually think it has a good plot and loveable characters. It's what got me to watch sports anime in the first place. FYI the animiation is also absolutly flawless. The voice acting was chosen perfectly for the characters and their personalities the soundtrack however is nothing to get excited over just average in my opinion. It has a great emotional sense and back-stories to match. I would recommend for a great sports comedy or just as a slice-of-life anime. ,18119,840,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Aww this show was sooooo cute! I love the power of friendship/slice of life anime. Though this one was a little slight it still had some great moments. It brings back nostalgia from when I was on a team from elementary school thru high school. hmmmm :),18121,841,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is great for various reasons although by a lot of people it is referred to as 'fanservice' I actually think it has a good plot and even better characters. The story told is of a young boy name Haru who has an exquisite passion for swimming and water. His friends and hisself begin a swim club and enter in various contests. Along the way they meet an old teammate and this opens a whole can of worms which is explored within the 12 episodes of this anime. ,18133,842,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,18137,843,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm going to come right out and say that I wouldn't classify this as a  sports  anime.  There is absolutely NO tension in the tournaments/competitions and there isn't much footage spent on the competitions either.,18139,844,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I wouldn't call this so much a movie as it is more of a complete waste of time to anyone who watched the series even if you didn't watch the series it's worth the extra 10 hours to do so.,18195,852,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched the series a while ago so I thought I would watch the movie. I really only watched it because it was part of the series box set. Since I bought it I decided to watch it. My main problem with the series was that I thought it was really boring. I thought since they would have to condense the show it would have a faster pace. While it did move faster it was too fast. It was probably the most confusing movie I've ever seen. It already had a story that made little sence but it didn't help that they were all over the place. It was like they took all of the important scenes from the show but did little to tie them together. A scene would suddenly end and the next thing you know he is fighting in his mech. Suddenly he is back talking to people. The only reason it made any sense is because I saw the series.,18197,853,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay I won't say it was great but it did cover a larger scope even getting some of the plot holes from the series itself (aka Haruka Mishima being Haruka Shto) out of the way so that people would actually understand what the hell it was going on.,18199,854,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think this anime isn't really that bad. Cause the story about  Fear  one of the main characters is quite interesting. And the story is in the center of mainstream and anti-mainstream. Even though there are a few parts of the story that doesn't makes sense but this anime is worth it to watch.,18247,861,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be honest I really enjoyed this series C3 was comical while maintaining a somewhat dark and dreadful atmosphere. The idea of a torture device as an maincharacter was unique in what I've seen and I really wish this would continue. The Gilotine scene was my favourate moment by far!!,18269,862,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's very rare I would actually take the time to sit down and write a review for an anime but I felt rather obligated to this time.  C³ is by far one of the best animes I have ever seen.  Everything about this anime was done right; the story was great the characters were so well developed and everything was just perfect!  A rather short series (or maybe it just felt that way) there is a lot of information crammed into the 24 minute episode but not so much that you don't understand it.  There is the perfect balance between dialogue and epic fight scenes; and of course your average serving of moe.  So sit down and watch C³; you wont regret it!,18283,867,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The two specials really ought to be reviewed and rated independently.  One of them is pretty forgettable (for instance I forgot everything that happened in it) but  Chapter L  is fall-out-of-your-chair hilarious.  It's about a not-seen-before former resident of their dorm named Lohmeyer who is enormous and extremely jolly.  If you enjoyed the humor in any part of the first season I can guarantee you will love Legendary Hero Nyanzaburo.,18307,872,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The name of this show doesn't do it good help. It is quite repulsive. Put the name aside and you'll find a splendid gem. The way is is done is ravinshingly nice. It is overwelhelming of nice ideas and cuteness. And damn those too nice characters. The animation is quite fluid and the music is decant and matches well the pace of the show. One negative point: the subtle energy is does produce during firsts episodes does quietlty fades away for more charming atmosphere but thsi show is a must-see for nice savored anime fans.,18343,887,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It was nice to see really introverted characters like this in an anime. Each character has very defined personalities that can't be related and aren't really stereotypical. The plot advances but kind of goes off to no where as the manga goes on but the anime just drops off and never picks up a second season. I really love animes with unique art and animation styles. A stale plain and generic style to me would be something like fruits basket. Lively colors in the show. I enjoyed how it shows parts of their every day life like cooking and going to the store. People say if you like this you'd like other anime and manga about fashion. I don't think so though. I think it's more about the introvertedness of the cast.,18365,891,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This Anime Movie was really good though I am not surprised at it's low scores. My son's father could not sit through it either.

It is one you need to pay attention if you want to really understand it's value.

Golden Time started off with a fresher setting than most anime a better romantic start-up than most anime and a lot more potential than it would wind up using. Having quit after nine episodes I can safely say that there are a decent majority of good points to this anime but they're all shadowed by a huge turd that has a lingering odor that permeates the anime too much for my own enjoyment.,18449,906,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't know why but I finished watching this series. It's not that I wouldn't recommend it but some things about it really bothered me.

It is a well done anime but if you are into realistic stories it is probably not the anime for you. Well it does make some sense as a drama anime because drama and romance anime always tend to be a bit unrealistic plot wise but still have realistic settings. But the story especially after like episode 10 makes no sense. It is not possible. And thein it starts getting really confusing because of all things happening (that are not possible in the real world) and all the things that cannot happen. I mean it's just a mess in the end. It doesn't even give you like a satisfying feeling. But the animation is good in HD.,18479,914,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First I want to say it's a romantic anime so if you dont want to see people falling in love it's better to turn away now since it won't be something you would like. But if you do then you will propably love (suki) this anime very much ^^. It's a really one of a kind story in my opinion and the cliffhangers at the end really want to make you watch the whole anime in one go! I myself didnt even take a break till episode 12 cuz the suspensions where that high in the anime. Well that will explain the 12/10 story rating (Which apparently this site doesnt approve ^^) further are the sound and character and animation good enough to really feel yourself in their position when they are troubled you feel troubled when they are happy you feel happy. Anyway i am in the middle of the anime right now (episode 12) but I just felt that I had to write things down. ,18489,917,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I finished watching Golden Time last night. And my reaction at the end was: meh. I don't know. I don't even know if I can write a review because I'm not sure I can pinpoint exactly what didn't convince me. ,18491,918,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just finished Golden Time and I have to say it was good and pretty intereseting. If you're looking for an anime thats different from the others then i'd say this is a good anime to watch (if your into romance and drama). This isn't my favorite though there are many other good animes which I think are better than this like Clannad which is my favorite drama and romance anime followed by Kanon and probably this. The reason I think it isnt as good as others is because it didnt make me cry a lot unlike Clannad which I thought was sad throughout the whole 2 seasons and Kanon too made my cry. But unlike Clannad or Kanon this had a very different and unique story actually it is somewhat like Kanon i wont tell why because that'll bring up spoilers. The main character Tada Banri is very different than a normal anime protagonist. Kanon as I said before had a story line similar to this but this was more 'extreme' and 'important'. Not saying too much just know that if you're looking for a good anime yet different to others to watch id recommend this.,18495,919,2019-04-13 21:35:40

To be honest I have no idea what this anime was about. I think that the best way to summarize it would be that this is a confusing story about angsty elementary schoolers who nearly die. At first it looks like a generic wacky anime about moe little girls who have adventures and protect their school from aliens but it isn't. It was traumatizing gory shit right there. You probably shouldn't watch this until you live on your own and know to cook... and then maybe you just still shouldn't watch it.,18631,946,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Judging solely from the picture here on anidb one would think thathis would be a standard magical girl OVA with no real innovation oromplexity. However without a doubt this is one of the strangestnimes I've ever seen. In Alien Nine incredibly cute shoujoharacters are juxtaposed against startling violence. The plot beginsn standard fruitcake mode (girls must roll around on rollerskates toatch aliens) but deviates from this formula very quickly. I for oneave no idea what happened in this anime.

First yes.  This anime is an alternate universe of the Fate/Stay franchise.  Given that I haven't watched any of the Fate/Stay franchise and I heard that this would be a good stand alone title I wanted to see if it was truly stand alone and if it could be enjoyed without any knowledge of the cannon material.  Given its average rating I didn't expect much from it.  But for a 10 episode commitment it seemed like something that I could easily pick up and breeze through in an afternoon.  ,18691,960,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't know much about idol dolls or  Vocaloids  which I believe are computer idol girls but this is most certainly nearly positively 90% sure a tie-in to one of them quite possibly named Miss Monochrome. Is it the EP with her dancing and singing? Maybe. Is it the dream of becoming an idol? Possibly. Is it the facts that she can plug into stuff charge up has a castle and 180 Quadrillion yen? Yes sure royal and super. Despite my lack of knowledge and accurate facts one doesn't need a background to enjoy the bite-sized minisodes.,18713,964,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Never in my life will I ever give another solid 10 on an anime for two reasons. One modern animes are trash compared to the classic ones (Same with Disney movies for that matter). And two this anime has EVERYTHING a good story needs. This anime has it all a good story an interesting hook good characters no dull moments good bad guys an overall objective from beginning to end and everything that makes a story enjoyable to watch. Could an anime be better? Perhaps but since Outlaw Star's release only very few have come close to matching it's granduer though none have surpased it. There are simply no bad sides to this anime so here is what it has that is good:,18815,980,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I watched this series when I was a younger child and I rewatched it many years later.  I never get bored of watching an anime over and over again if I love it.  I love this short anime and it makes me sad that it ended.  However for the amount of episodes it was perfect.  The characters have lots of different traits that make them stand out and unique.  I found that Mel stood out most since she is that odd being in this series.  The plot was too overly complicated but it wasn't too simple either.  Great watch.,18819,982,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was really excited going into this show. I was told that it is a lot like Cowboy Bebop and I loved Cowboy Bebop. After watching it I can say that it is a lot like it. Just imagine Cowboy Bebop more light hearted. Some might call OS a rip off of Bebop but remember that Outlaw Star did air before Cowboy Bebop (though it only started three months before).,18821,983,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the better amines that i have seen if you like sci-fi action with a cowboy twist this maybe one for you one of the other amines i have seen that's like this is Cowboy Bebop,18823,984,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show reminds me alot like Btoom Deadman Wonderland No Game No Life....the art style is one the most sharp drastic beautiful animations I seen in a while...while the story is a bit confusing with a lot of misleading elements. I would just suggest to watch and enjoy it for what it is...the problem with these anime...they need more than 12 episodes to a establish a solid story line.,18881,995,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Anime prompting them to reflect on the value of the money . It shows what can happen if swistku inconspicuous miss this paper. With this title to man comes to mind : as I would have done with these funds. On the one hand the man smiles as he could himself let to buy different things whose he desired and also what can be the consequences in the future.

There are a few things that immediately grab your attention about this show. First the start of the series is extremely fast. They put you in the place of the main character and you know everything he does... which amount to nothing. You sit there for a moment after the first episode wondering what the hell just happened. Second you find out an extremely interesting looking world. Third if you can keep up you find a brilliant concept that continues to get more in depth and interesting as the series progresses.,18983,7,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ever had a feeling of watching a show that was really close to another? Well I have been having that with this show. This show is much like that and reminds me of Martial Heart although not as bad. Both have school girls fighting duals against other people in many different get ups from kimono’s to bad ass ninja clothing and they all have a different way of fighting. There is also a lot of nudity the difference though being that the nudity isn’t actually in the fighting. It’s all in the school life drama that unfolds. The school life is just as it sounds like like every other school life genre with the gags running wild from perverted school mates to love life triangles.,19053,15,2019-04-13 21:35:40
How boring did not like this at all the show starts of with some sort of bullshit civil war with some of the classmates fighting each other with fake weapons it introduces alot of charcters right off the bat. this show's humor was too silly for me to consider liking it,19059,16,2019-04-13 21:35:40

if you came looking for an anime with good story you came to the wrong place fuck the story there is none what matters is the comedial segments in every single episode. The personalities of the characters mixed well creating hilarious scenes that kept me laughing so hard i cried because it hurt. the fights were interesting but not enough to care about the main focus of this anime was to make people laugh and it did the job right.,19073,21,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There was no real story behind Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!! - it was mainly  exposure  for fan service. For the most part Majikoi had some good action/fighting scenes involved but evidently there was no real other standout features.,19081,22,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Naeko & Kousuke are the rich kids assigned  maid agents  who cook clean and protect the siblings who are under threat before they receive a grand inheritence. While the overaching story is typically non-sensicle the humour much of it boobs-based is hilarious. The characters are great particularly Maid-Guy with many special moves and imappropriate investigations into the life of his young female charge. I really liked the fun of this anime and think it succeeds in all it's ambitions.,19109,27,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,19111,28,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If this season wasn't filled with pointless (and often boring) filler episodes it would overshadow the first season completely.  12 out of the 25 episodes in this season are fillers and most of them are ones I'll never watch again.  However on the positive side the animators finally fixed that nasty  still frame  habit with the fight scenes.,19115,29,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be completely honest I watched one episode of this and got rid of itmmediately after but I did watch all 50 of the first season and felt thatne was all I could really handle of this. This really is a shame since (whileointless) the first season was very good.,19117,30,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,19125,33,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wouldn't say this anime is perfect but it's probably my favorite anyways.  Great characters script pacing comedy setting and really everything.  What it doesn't have is action sequences.  If that's all you're looking for out of a show (i.e. Bleach) then this is obviously not your cup of tea.  It's not a gripping or thrilling story at least until the last few episodes but it's a very...satisfying one.  At least for me.  One of the main themes of the show is the disconnect between ideals and reality.  Another is the nature of capitalism and how it forces some people to the bottom of the heap.  And of course there's the time-honored classic of how people can never truly communicate which each other but that's fine because it's all we've got.  All of these ideas are things that matter to me so this show was perfect for me.       ,19133,34,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Perhaps the most interesting anime to compare Planetes to is Last Exile not for the similarities between the two but for the differences.he two animes both attempt to show an alternate futuristic world with large cast of characters but the actual approaches are radicallyifferent.,19165,41,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Planetes is a very good watch. It's a sci-fi anime with some comedy aspects especially at the beginning developing then as it progresses into an engaging drama - with a slice-of-life take on all the story. I liked several things about this anime; it's very realistic its characters are believable and incredibly well-portrayed and they face struggles which you can easily relate to and last but not least it deals with an array of interesting topics in a non-superficial way. It obviously does have some flaws but on a balance I have to say that the good far outweighs the bad or simply annoying. I would also like to mention that it's an adult drama as in its protagonists are adults that face adult problems; and thus I'd say it's target is definetely an adult audience.  ,19167,42,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Planetes is a strong anime on several levels: as a realistic sci-fi that paints a detailed and interesting vision of the future of space travel as a drama that builds some rich characters and delves into their various perspectives philosophies and emotional development and also partly as political discussion on the possible implications of space travel.  It is an adult drama not in terms of having any ecchi content but the characters are all adults and Planetes delves into them their perspectives agonies and relationships in a serious way.  The backdrop set about 70 years in the future is that commercial development of space is now a serious reality with colonies on the moon major space stations and space resource mining as major commercial ventures.  The show revolves around a department of space debris collectors at a major firm; the vast quantity of orbiting space debris now being one of the major impediments in the commercial use of space but in the latter half it sprawls out from there.  ",19191,48,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First I would like to say that this anime is pretty silly. It really surprised me actually because a glance at it mislead me to think it would be fairly average and possibly not worth it.

Okay can I just say how BORING this movie was? I have a hard time quitting things after I've started or I probably would have stopped watching this. Eighty percent of the movie was flashbacks from the anime (as the movie takes place a year later). Ten percent were flashbacks that we didnt see in the anime. Ten percent of the movie actually took place in the present.,19251,63,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story is about different types of humans that live on the ocean floor. It follows four 14-year-old middle school students from the sea village that after their school closes down have to attend Mihama Middle School on the surface. The story then follows their struggles to adjust to a new environment and the relationships between the sea and land people. They also have to deal with their own feelings that have just started appearing between each other.

A few years ago Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure one of the finest manga ever made was finally given the anime treatment it deserved.

I first came across the series as a whole after watching two Let's Players play a fighting game for this anime.  They were really excited about it and had nothing but praise for it.  So I thought that I should just check it out.  Although this is a continuation of the series as whole it's practically a whole new show with some background info.,19337,79,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay so this anime took  me a while to get into; at first I didn't care for the animation style but once I started watching it that grew on me and honestly this is one of my favorite anime. I started getting into this show..about maybe two years ago? I want to say two years anyway I love this eries for it just being so differunt and out there sometimes. The charcaters are awesome and memorable I remember them all and I love them all for how unique and funny they are. ,19351,80,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So starting into this anime you get the sense of oh here we go a love story of an adult and child pedo alert. Though its more than that you see the story of 10 yr old Succubus princess Astarotte (Lotte) and her first attempt at letting a guy really into her life after the  trauma  of seeing her mother the Succubus queen and a man  doing it  at a very young age. But she needs to form a harem of men so she can suck out their  life seed  to maintain her beatuy for when she takes over as queen later in life. She decides it best to leave the main castle and live in an estate on the edge of the kingdom untill she must take over the kingdoms ruler. Naoya must be her stepping stone to adulthood and the start of her non distrust of men. While ill be the first to admit it is on the pedo side but its japan they do many things american would see as inapporpriat.,19365,82,2019-04-13 21:35:40

it's like Lolita minus the controversial parts unless you count the implied stuff. This anime is overall nothing special but the voice acting is reasonably decent. On the plus side there's lots of fanservice that inevitably boosted the score on my part otherwise.

Despite the obvious flaws of this series it's genuinely one of my favorites. Most people are immediately turned off once they read the words  ten year old succubus must drink semen to live.  Which they should be. But if you actually give it a chance - which it seems most people don't judging by other reviews I've read - it has a far more cohesive story than most ecchi. I actually forgot this was an ecchi as there was barely any nudity.,19429,89,2019-04-13 21:35:40
**I am not a fan of loli (which is a term I didn't even know existed before I watched this anime) and because of that it may have prevented me from enjoying this anime.  However I believe it when I saw that I will never like loli and I believe this anime was borderline into pedophilia.,19431,90,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I had first watched Ghost in the Shell I was glued to the screen and immediately thought of the movie as a masterpiece.

My reason for giving this legendary anime full score is because it truly deserves that. I really can't find any faults with this anime. The music is amazing whether it is the first opening Again by Yui or the soundtracks in the show it just is perfect. The story is a masterpeice. It is like the Lord of Rings of the anime world. An anime like that only comes once in a decade. The way Ed and Al goes through all those hardship just to get their bodies back is heart touching. The way the comedy is incorporated into the story is truly a work of a genius and few animes can be serious and deliver comedy at the same time. The character development is great. I really felt i was on the journey with Ed and Al. You can really see how they Elric Brothers matured over the course of the anime. The supporting characters were just as good. I am personally a big fan of Roy Riza Olivier Maes and Ling. Even though there isn't much background information on them the little information we get of them just intrigues you even more and makes them more likeable. The villain are also well developed the back story of Father is well written and makes you even more interested. Spoiler ahead! Some people say the ending is a bit cheesy. But honestly after everything Ed and Al went through you really want them to have a happy ending. They lost their mother and lost their bodies for Gods Sake!! They need that happy ending. Honestly Kudos to Bones studio for making such an amazing anime. And if you want to know whether to watch sub or dub. Watch both if you can cos both are great voice acting. But personally i loved the dub.     ,19481,100,2019-04-13 21:35:40
All I can say is that this anime is epic. The story is awesome I love it.The end of the story is very emotional I think I cried at the whole episodes from the ending. The animation is great. The sound is so good that I cried only at the openings and endings just imagine how great the story is. The characters are great I never forgot one's name (unlike other animes). Overall one of my favorites it deserves 15 out of 10 that's how awesome it is.,19489,101,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,19495,102,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is what you call a masterpiece. After you finish this show you will feel like what do i do with liefe now I just watched the greatest art ever created. Well again this show is so amazing If i were you i would watch it,19497,103,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story,19501,104,2019-04-13 21:35:40
       When I finally got into the first season of FMA I couldn't believe how great it was. It was already dubbed by this point (seemed I was one of the few who hadn't seen it yet) and I didn't quite believe the hordes of fans that had popped up (dub fans tend to drool over shows like Naruto >.>) but for some reason I picked it up anyway. I quickly ate through the episodes realizing it just kept getting better and better. One of the best anime I've ever seen. Now enter Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.,19505,105,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first anime of full metal alchemist was epic but original from the manga. This one is full based on the manga. The characters are great the animation fresh and clear not like dragon ball kai and the most importante thing: The story is EPIC you just have to watch this anime :3,19511,106,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story of both the FMA series was good but Brotherhood turned out to be better than the original FMA. the animation improved and so did the story the deaths were definitly sad but what I truly like about the anime is that it is not only action but its a mix of actioncomedya bit of drama + sci fi. This anime is one of the best ones I know. ,19513,107,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For a year or so I actually avoided this. I watched the 2003-2004 series. I liked it a lot but the ending was catastrophic. One of the worts ending I have ever seen. The the new series came out and I read that its basically the same thing so I wasnt too interested. After some time I read that the story deviates from the first series at some point and they never go back. This time the sotry is GOOD! So I gave Brotherhood a chance. And now I deserve a virtual pat on the back for that idea because FMAB is one of the best animes I have ever seen.,19521,111,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show blew me away. The way all the facts were tied in and the plot was carried out was like the best slap in my face EVER. I loved it! Best anime and manga I have ever read and watched.,19523,112,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"When I first started watching Full Metal Alchemist:Brotherhood I couldn't help but want Edward and his brother to find the philsopher's stone but as the story went on. I felt like there was no good guy in this anime even though Ed and Al are the super helpful duo. I just felt like they started to lose their childhood and have to witness things no one should have to and I kept thinking how getting their bodies back wasn't worth all they were losing in the process and that made me really sad.On that note this series is very humorous and funny. Despite all the sad stuff it really makes you appreciate the small things in life. I assure you if you watch this series you will not be dissapointed.  ",19555,116,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ah the new Fullmetal Alchemist.  You had such promise.  The first thirty episodes of this are amazing.  Bar none the best story I've ever seen in an anime.  It was intense it was epic it had twists and turns.  Nobody knew who the true enemies were what was really going on and it was getting revealed little by little in the best way possible.  The action was great the script interesting the characters fascinating.  But...things wound down.  I got bored.  I think it's just the nature of this kind of story.  Once everything gets revealed and there's not really any more twists left things got...normal.  Average.  The humor got progressively more slapstick.  The action which used to be fighting-for-your-life-against-impossible-enemies fantastic got progressively more standard shounen.  (He attacked!  Oh no!  Well how about this!  Counterattack!  Hiya!  So there!  You are indeed powerful but I am more powerful!)  A bit of fan service got introduced.  Characters motivated by  Because I might as well  came into play.  I read the manga too to where it's at right now.  It's not the anime's fault it's really the fault of the manga.  The pace has slowed to a crawl.  It's just that all that's left to do now is fight it out and the fights now are just boring.  You know that none of the important characters can die.  You know who the enemies are.  You know what's going to happen next.  Sure it's still impressively epic.  The execution level is still high.  It may have become more predictable and standard but it's still high quality.  It's just so disappointing after such an amazing beginning.  Unless they pull off a huge fantastic doozy of an ending this'll go into my bin of  So close but not quite  animes.  ,19573,120,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is hands down thee best anime and one of the best television programs in general that I have ever seen. It was epic. It sold me on the shounen genre. It gave me an array of emotions from anger to sadness to happiness and everything in between. At 64 eps this is a beast...and there's practically NO filler. Every episode is needed to move the story forward and every episode was amazing. Going in I almost gave up at first because the voice actor who played Al was different and because I thought NOTHING would ever be able to trump FMA. Boy am I glad I stuck with this. The first 13 episodes were retold well (though sped through a bit) which made me happy I had met the characters before in the original. The animation was better and Ed was hilarious in this one. I got hooked as I did on the first anime but this one was so much more. The story was polished and whole in comparison to the first and I think that's what gave this one the edge. It was realized thoroughly.,19581,122,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hands down one of my favorites. There are so many interesting elements to this anime and it's just fun to watch. Great voice acting cast on the dub good pacing and excellent character development. My only complaint would be that the plot gets muddled at times especially at the end when they're doing the heroic wrap-up thing. However it's enough to overlook. I highly recommend watching both FMA and FMA:Brotherhood in order to make the most of the story. Each has minor differences and reveals different pieces of a story making them a good set. Comic relief but just enough seriousness. ,19613,127,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Brotherhood compared to original FMA is less serious less emotion and seems to be trying very hard to be funny. FMA is very different from FMAB and the differences are sooooo clear that i can point them out in comparion to FMA...but because FMA is such a good anime/manga i really have nothing against FMAB...^^,19629,130,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I won't start by telling FMA or Fullemetal Alchemist' history. I reckon almost every otaku out there know at least this franchise by name alone. I haven't seen the original anime series and I haven't finished reading the manga so I won't compare brotherhood with it's predesessor. Instead I will review rationnally and will not diverge in fanlove. If I am a Fullmetal diehard fan? No. If I loved Brotherhood? HELL YEAH.,19631,131,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Shounen anime tend to be like Kraft cheese singles; they taste delicious when you are young but as you get older you realize they are actually awful and have too much filler. I kind of miss the days when I could watch Naruto and enjoy it but there are only so many meandering waste-of-time 100 episode wankoffs that a person can reasonably enjoy before they become completely jaded. Have you read my sappy cloying review of One Piece? I actually hate that show now.,19671,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40

With the exception of the world itself FMA: Brotherhood is a very different anime than the original series. Brotherhood has a great story and there are multiple messages that are very deep and can easily be applied to our lives. There are many people that would learn a lot from watching this anime which is a rare ability for an anime to have. Hope sacrifice weakness survival instincts spirit love. I could go on for a while about what this anime comments on you get the point. The depth and the development of the characters are what makes the ending of the anime hit you like a pro boxer's finishing move. This makes Brotherhood one of the few anime that almost managed to bring me to tears. I'm pretty sure just about everyone has recommended Brotherhood to you and unfortunately I couldn't differ from the norm here even if I wanted to. Brotherhood is a great anime and I recommend it.,19683,140,2019-04-13 21:35:40
STORY: Alright alright.... So Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood follows the original Manga more closely than it's predecessor Fullmetal Alchemist. I'll introduce you to the so called  story . Ed and Al are brothers who lives with their mother Trisha in a small village of Risembool. Trisha dies of a strange disease and Ed and Al try to bring her back to life by using a magic called Alchemy in doing so Ed loses an arm and a leg and Al loses his whole body. Ed and Al set out to look for the Philosopher stone that is said to break the rules of Alchemy. There is also some military business and something about Homunculus but for the life of me I can't pay attention to it. And thus the  journey  begins. So FMA Brotherhood... I keep on reminding myself of how good the first series is. You see where as the first FMA was a fantastic fantasy world Brotherhood fails to pull me in or build up on any atmosphere or charm. Without atmosphere it's very hard to be sucked into the story but that isn't to say the story is not good the story is very good! The story has a ton of twists and turns with a lot going on but there is no charm which makes all the events just seem bland. Sure it may of not needed charm if it weren't for the fact that the story has an absurd amount of comic relief maybe the comic relief was supposed to be charming however the comic relief is so misplace and awkward it kills any atmosphere the story was trying to build up upon. The drama is also very weak it actually is more soap opera like than the first series barely any of the moments manage to squeeze a single tear from my eyes. It's that weak. Moments that brought tears to my eyes in the first series are just a side note in Brotherhood. It is also worth noting that Brotherhood absolutely does not feel like an adventure but more like a series of events so much happens in a single episode that all the episodes just seem to run together. This is alright if you are heavily into action but it really gets in the way of any heartwarming or tear jerking moments. One more thing I think I should talk about is the symbolism and Philosophy The symbolism in Brotherhood is barely noticeable but even if it was why should I care about it if the show doesn't even let me into it's world? If I was sucked into the world then I would care then I would say  THIS IS BRILLIANT!  The philosophy has an entirely different problem. Brotherhood has many different themes like  Friendship (Yu-gi-oh)   Revenge (Naruto)  and some old Greek philosophies. This is all well and good but it's hard to take it seriously when there is some silly comic relief taking place only a few moments after  Za Meaning of Life . All in all the story does seem like it has a lot to offer but the bad pacing comic relief and overall lack of tone and atmosphere brings it down. All it needed is some better direction. 5/10,19685,141,2019-04-13 21:35:40

You cannot be into anime and at least not have heard about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  When I was younger I have heard about it but never had the chacne to finally watch it.  However my cousin had to spend the week at my house while he moved and I suggested we watch the whole thing even though he watched it.  Shout out to him for watching it with me.  I marathoned this in about 3 days with him.,19703,145,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was actually one of my most anticipated animes ever for the simple fact that it was meant to be a true to manga adaptation instead of the spin-off that the first anime seemed to be. As such my expectations for this were very high and let me tell you it doesn't dissappoint.,19705,146,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Parodies only work if they're funny. Luckily Puni Puni Poemy delivers as possibly the funniest parody of Hentai ever. The artwork is crude the writing is cruder the pace is fast to a ridiculous degree. It makes fun of magical girls their skimpy outfits and semi-pornographic tranformation scenes lolicon ecchi yuri bondage tentacles and everything else you could think of. In short this is a parody of all that and of itself at the same time.,19799,164,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A very solid anime with characters you will fall in love with. The simplicity of this anime is what makes it; there are no emotional taxing situtation no crazy fight scenes. If you're looking for something sweet that doesn't require any emotional investment that you can roll your eyes at and sigh at the adorableness of the romance then this anime is for you. The characters are very good when you've finished the anime you'll be smiling but wishing you got a bit more back story behind the minor characters. Animation is quite appealing as is the sound track. Akagami no Shirayukihime is satisfyingly romantic and cute as it explores how two people from different social classes meet become friends and eventually fall in love.,19817,167,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When I first started watching this anime I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. The first episode seemed a little bit out there as animes go. Not many seem quite so medieval/outdoorsy and even fewer focus on plants as heavily as this one. However it's grown to be so adorable and relatable despite the whole royal castle factor that it's hard not to love. This series even goes the extra step of making you want to be in it. You will be so jealous of the interactions between the main character and the prince because they so obviously fell in love at first sight that you'll wish it was you. These characters so deeply care for each other without fail every episode and yet they are both completely independent and oblivious to the other's feelings. It's just adorable. I have aww'ed so many times watching this anime that I can't wait for more! ...Seriously where's the next episode?,19825,168,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. Whether it would just be another dime-a-dozen romance slice of life with aspects of comedy and drama or whether it would end up being something completely different.,19831,169,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Akagami no Shirayukihime isn't original in the least; everything is highly predictable from the plot to the characters' reactions. And yet I'm rating it 6/10. I guess because I just finished watching it and I've got a smile on my face. It's so full of naive good intentions and genuinely positive feelings that it's kind of disarming in the end.,19839,170,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,19841,171,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not ♥ but ❤! The moral stories are magnificent the romance is unlike in any other anime! Friendship and love is evident since it is so sincere! In other anime when a character likes another there is hesitance and shyness but not in this anime. Wonderful!❤,19843,172,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A girl who has an rare hair that is color red. Got bumped into a guy who turn out to be a prince of Clarines. I do love this anime this is the best romance in this summer season. How will Zen and shirayuki realize their feelings together I do like the plot and story ^^,19845,173,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I extremely have enjoyed watching the anime so far! The art style and pretty much everything about the anime has reminded me so much of Fire Emblem the game. The characters are all strong and can be seen as independent of each other which leads to strengthening the anime and characters. There are still a ton of areas in the world our heros can go on and I am looking forward to the rest of the episodes in Season 1 along with Season 2 in 2016. The anime has so far had amazing character development and always makes the audience want to see more especially with how well the graphics haven been put together. I think what I personally like about this anime the most is the fact that it ISN'T like Snow White besides the first episode and that it decides to take it's own path allowing for originality. Unlike many other slice of life animes I have watched still working on seeing all of them I feel a deep connection between the passion and sense of adventure that drags me into this world. I hope many of you will love the anime as much as I have and I can't wait until the next episodes.,19849,174,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First impression oh crap this is a Japanese anime version of Disney….. I should just turn this off right now. I mean the name itself is referencing a fairy tale but still. Well luckily it was worth keeping on. The first episode certainly feels like it’s referencing several different movies but it becomes its own story as it continues. Even though it doesn’t seem like it would have any good action scenes the sword fights are pretty good.,19855,175,2019-04-13 21:35:40

From al the good animes i've seen already this is definitly at the bottom of my list. the story isn't bad but with the concept it could have been better. The battles expect kanata his battles are boring. The endboss was just terrible. And the idea of failures becoming   the best  in such a short time doesn't interest me. The only character i really liked was kanata. My opninion is don't bother watching it. ,19879,182,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story 7/10,19889,184,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I never wrote a review yet but ohh god how i regretted watching these whole 12 episodes of my worst ever seen anime. Tbh the start of the series was good there was one main character who seemed to have overpowered strenght and then some girls with their specific characters (seemed like something similar as Chrome Shield Regios). But as the story progressed the training and all that stuff took too many episodes to complete and when finaly the episodes starts to get somewhat interesting the anime is already completed and the next episode is the last one (which was the most terrible ending of all my seen animes). I would give this anime 1.5/10 because it didn't have anything good (except maybe a nice start) as i wrote before it was a realy forced ending when after a long training session with the girl characters (which are like usual ones - annoying tsundere type shy and then the bossy one) they win a turney with 10 or something like that people in it in like two episodes... Wouldn't recommend to watch unless you realy realy don't have anything better to do/watch.,19897,185,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I hardly ever write a review for a show that I don't watch all the way through but I simply can't stand to watch anymore of this one. I think it may be one of the worst shows I've ever seen...,19899,186,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is yet another light novel trash adaptation. The premise is unimaginative boring and never explored. The threat to the humanity is just bunch of lazily designed bugs. They look like enemies from some old shitty video game. Main hero too is from long series of hated (misunderstood) by everyone over-powered guys. His task is to train trio of the worst students at the school of battle mages. This all-girl trio consists of incompetent klutz very shy girl and very arrogant poser girl. There is also 4th girl the obligatory tsundere. The story is not focused on the battles but rather to overcoming of the female protagonists' issues. It consists mostly of diddling around and having ecchi/romantic moments between leading male protagonists and his harem members. Most of training moments are boring. The very same can be said about the battles. The tournament part that might be interesting is time skipped. Animation is bit lazy. Sound and music completely forgettable. In summary it is bad.,19901,187,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Simple short to the point and not without some humor. While I could complain that the characters are 1 dimensional steriotypes and jokes unto themselves it's a one episode OVA series (yes there's a second episode but as of this review seeing it or not is a 50/50 shot). ,19905,188,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh cool I'm the first one to make a review for this! Okay this anime is about a virgin witch named Maria (ironic huh -.-) who doesn't like war. And she always interferes with the wars and stops them which results in her making most people her enemy including the church of the heavens (I think it was called that) So because she won't stop no matter what anyone says the messenger Michael (hehe you get where this is going?) sends Ezekiel to watch over her btw Ezekiel is a female dove who has a human form just like Maria's familiars which are owls. I'm just gonna go to a quick little sidebar her male familiar has no male body part HAHAHAHA! She's seen one ONCE but she still refused to give him one. Thats just a little crude humor :P Alright back to subject. Along with appointing Ezekiel to watch over her she is also now cursed so that if she loses her virginity she will lose her magic as well. Lemme just point out that this anime is SO over PG13 in my book! Anyway she falls in love with a boy named Joseph who is in love with her too. This is a cute anime only because of her pureness in everything! But wait... The church gets ahold of the information that if Maria loses her virginity her magic goes with it. They decide to take advantage of this and send someone to take it from her when her familiars are out. Whats going to happen to poor Maria?!,19917,191,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So now my review for Maria the Virgin Witch this is a highly religious program based around the medieval era in France. By a  village in France there is a witch who lives in the forest this is Maria…and she is a Virgin. Well that is the basic thing…other than that most people hate her except a few. A very sexual anime if I can say that.,19921,193,2019-04-13 21:35:40
" ",19923,194,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story and premise feel a bit misunderstood by that I mean as if the history was not totally comprehended in all respects but only in minor points.  The look and apparent age of the main character seem abit off the mark too especially given to how people tend to react around her.  The effect of the area and people around her make it seem she is far older than her appearance and yet when you see her up close she does little to affirm the impression others have regarding her maturity and experience.  Still she is one of the most fun characters I have ever seen in an anime and shines as a great leading female character.  I feel a bit puzzled why Michael is portrayed as such a heartless monster as he is in the series which really contradicts the very idea he is anything approaching holy.  There is also a bit of muddled confusion about the other so called witches because they never seem to actually being doing a job and no hint of who if anyone hired them ever comes to light.  So although some aspects come off as pretty weak the strength and entertainment value of the main character and her charming personality do much to offset alot of the shortfalls.  It might be prudent to simply say some of those shortfalls were simply left by the wayside to focus more on the lead characters.  Her factial reactions blushing faces attempts to deflect teasing even by her own familiars make her a cute adorable type of character that is hard to dislike.  Her facial reactions alone are so well emotionally charged and well done that I would have to rate that as among the highest of any anime.  In the sense of emotional reaction and facial movements accompanying that reaction this anime stands tall above others.  ,19925,195,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I just had a marathon of this anime I could not put it down. As a huge shojo/romance buff I felt that this series had everything that I was looking for my only regret was that it ended  unfinished  so to speak. Since it's been three years since it ended it probably will not be getting a sequel which is a shame. I enjoyed this show. If you dig shojo you will love it. If you don't you won't. Even while watching it I was thinking  geez there's a lot of romance scenes (love triangles like crazy) but for people who don't like romance (or prefer action/adventure scenes) no wonder they thought this series was boring ",19957,202,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Un-Go is an anime which is both cleaver and stupid at the same time with some elements being great and another being too stupid and unbelievable. Now to watch this anime you must watch the episode Zero to understand a little bit about the world that the main character lives in and how he got to wear he is in the first episode because otherwise they do a poor explanation which no one ever listens to become it come normally when they relieve the killer.,19973,207,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Un-Go was on my list for some time now but I could never put myself to watch it.

This episode does not really continue from where the main story left off no big surprise there. Actually I am not really sure where on the timeline this episode would fall. It seems to fall afterwards based on the fact that no one is even mentioning killing her for real and some other little conversations. On the other hand they are still with the teacher and the teacher mentions he wants them to all graduate so it would seem it's before the main story ends. I just decided it's a stand alone and doesn't actually fit in the main story timeline at all.,20023,225,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ghost in the Shell 2nd gig is a rather complex story line.  I mean so much happens it’s amazing I can still remember after watching it like 3 times but I will try.  In the future Asian refugees have started to come into Japan legally and started to take low paying jobs.  Without Major in Section 9 solving crime has been harder and harder but behind the scenes Major is working diligently to discover who is leading the refugees to a growing war.  With glimpses into team members of section 9's past and clues concerning Kuze's (revolutionary war leader) whereabouts how could anyone want to miss the exhilarating on-edge chase to stop the most wanted terrorist.  (Alright for making that up on my own I did pretty damn good.  Watch it and just see how amazing it is yourself.)  The story by far is more interesting than the 1st gig but im a gun-ho kinda guy so that may be the reason.  In 26 episodes there is quite a plot here with corrupt government officials to the revolution the criminals never cease.  Just take my word for it it will keep you on your toes the whole time.,20117,249,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I went into Angel's Egg expecting somethingery thought-provoking and to say the least was blown away by the depth thisnime delved. To state bluntly those who do not enjoy philosophical thought ornime with little dialogue may want to stop reading now and move on toomething else.

Angels Egg is the most beautiful and profound anime I've ever seen. It may seem random and confusing to some viewers but it contains a very powerful message. From the reviews I've read it seems Mamoru Oshii gets most of the credit. But there is a certain charm and  warmth  to this film that is only possible due to the style of co-creator Yoshitaka Amano. Although there is little dialogue the atmosphere and pace of the story carry it along wonderfully. Though there will be many viewers who see the movie as  slow  due to the lack of  action . Everything in this film works together in harmony. It is a very haunting film - one of the few animes that I have seen multiple times and will see again in the future.,20153,257,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is more of the same of what season one was except now there are new more dangerous adversaries and a new competitor to the pandoras.  Honestly it has even more needless violence gore bloodshed frivolous panty shots and shots of undressed girls and girl parts and sexual situations.  Though it was hinted at in season one you actually see the monster brother in this season.  He is the single worst character in the series and the one most deserving of punishment if not death.  Though I would love to see him ripped to shreds a few times over and over.  it is even more disturbing because now he is confronted but again she doesn't seem to react to a abusive rapist the way almost every woman on Earth is likely to react.  The entire story arc is so unrealistic.  It would be far more believable if she turned him in or stabbed him when he tries to see her at night.  He is a character everyone will love to hate and watch get mauled to death in compensation for his disturbing sins.  I am puzzled too because both Bridget and the new victim of her sick brother's abuse are powerful pandoras and way more powerful than that sadistic twerp so why would they take that abuse from such a worthless and screwed up individual?  And worse why don't his family give a crap about what kind of freak he is?  Maybe they are as sick and twisted as that mistake of nature is.  Such vomit inducing things make people want to tune out more than tune in.  Sure crap like that happens and you can develop Stockholme syndrome however this is a story and if such a thing were part of it it should be made clear and included.  That would be the only reason why however she still talks to that creep at all as far as I can tell.  I wonder if that is something against the US.  Not withstanding that slight jab at the US the whole thing done in Alaska is so far from what America is that it would be more believable it would happen by the smurfs on the moon.  It might be possible some rogue nut case gets away with that on a small scale but that is not what happens in Alaska and it is pretty clear even early on if anyone has a modicrum of observational skill that something is wrong there.  ,20185,264,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A really great movie...infact the best one i have ever seen so far so surprised they could make a movie out of such a random anime :P only thing that was a bit weird that i removed score from story(which i actually shouldnt but oh well) is the first 3 minutes of the video and the last 5 minutes i think of the movie those 2 moments were just not supposed to be in it....but they were a bit funny...anyway GO WATCH GO WATCH!

My scores don't really match up with my over all rating for one basic reson. Naruto Shippuden is really in a class of it's own. The fillers that this and the orginial Naruto contain is at a very high amount but the actual meat is just amazing. This and the orgnial are two different animes that just shouldn't be confused. Both are very good in their own rught but yeah. Sakura has always grinded my gears. Since the very beginning. I couldn't really wrap my brain around how much she annoyed me. But she got better. Maybe only a little but at least I can tolerate her now. Thats always good. And everyone is spectacular. Naruto is still the same person he was before just stronger. THAT'S what i like to see.,20235,278,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I didn't find Naruto that apealing but once it switched over to naruto shippuden i started following it alot more.  The characters from Naruto are all back and they are now older.  They also now have new sets of skills and the battles become more intese.  The storys now start to develop the world around them and is no longer just about Konoha.,20237,279,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Naruto Shippuden is a very good anime i would recomend it to anyone but as all animes that go over 100 episode or have 4 timeskips its bound to have some flaws. Now before you read the rest of this i am not against the franchise and try to roll shit into it I love it Naruto was the first anime and manga i got overobsesed with so dont call me a dick.,20329,284,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story of a boy who was an outcast but has worked hard to make friends and achieve his dream of becoming the leader of his village. This is the second half of the series and unlike the first part of the series this half is more battle oriented and expands on the world of Naruto. The story is pretty amazing the only bad part of the entire series are the filler episodes which tend to be really dull and feel like just a prolonging of the series. But don't let this get you down getting past the filler episodes are worth it to see how this story unfolds. Naruto Shippuden is a must see for any anime lover however I recommend that you watch the first half of the series before watching it otherwise you just want understand.,20359,287,2019-04-13 21:35:40
In this season it gets wayy more exciting and I like how the characters are growing up and developing stronger powers.  I can't wait for it to be finished but the story really draws you in and makes you want to watch more.,20365,288,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show has far surpassed my expectations of the first series.The storyline is so informative and powerful there's nothing you won't understand if you watch every episode accordingly.I love that all the characters have grown and the action is even more defined and EPIC!This has made DBZ look terrible in comparison.The story can make you laughcryget angry at the bad guys and more.The one thing I do dislike is that they reshow the same parts over and over again in flashbacks but since they do add other sides to the story we already know it makes up for it.If you're  a anime junky that is only satisfied by great action and a strong storyline look no further here it is!To new watchers you have to watch the first series before you move on to Shippuden at least to the Naruto vs. Sasuke epic fight.-Hellzblade,20381,292,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched 415 episodes of this before I finally gave up on it.   Have you ever played poker?  Well I went all in on this and lost my shirt.  It's worth mentioning that this isn't a terrible anime if you avoid the filler.  I'd recommend going online and viewing which episodes are the filler and just skipping them as they add literally nothing.,20383,293,2019-04-13 21:35:40

has a good amount of action and story/plot is good however the fillers are not properly placed. most go off into something totally different then what the current event is. Also too many fillers are in place of the story character development and design is good the action/fight seens are good. but just to much in the way of actual story and it ruins the series. i suggest skipping the fillers that add nothing to the plot and then it can be considered good.,20423,296,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"As one of the very few manga addicts that owns all the latest Naruto books I say that this anime season is actually better than the first naruto series. The stroy changed from revolving around team seven and is spreading through the entire ninja world. The characters are a lot better drawn and thier voices changed from the annoying childish voices to more mature along with thier phisical apperances. In conclusion the anime got a lot deeper and has improved quite drastically. ",20441,298,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Honestly this is one of my favourite animes i also think is way better then the first naruto. Even if you dont like ninjas you might even like it so i recommend this anime to anyone! the only reason i give it 9 and not 10 is becasue of all the flashbacks and fillers but other then that i think its an amazing anime. So if you think about watch the anime i hope you like it!,20463,302,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"naruto shippuuden is a resonably good anime for its story and deep relationships throughout the story it starts with naruto in turmoil because his best friend has betrayed him and sided with the man that attacked his villege and naruto will stop at nothing to get his friend back even if it means his life ",20469,303,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's great it really is but I think some characters are over the top and some were just added to fill in gaps. Also quite often the syncing with the lips is wrong. The characters are great it's perfect. They all have their own role and personality so it does make a great impact. The story makes you get an emotional attachment with some of the main characters and when they are in danger or when they die you actually feel it so it shows how brilliant the story is built. Overall I think it's perfect.,20471,304,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just stopped watching it because of poorly made fillers. They shuould had ended the anime in glory rather than destroying it with fillers. Great potential ruined. Very sad.,20473,305,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In my opinion Kaze To Ki No Uta (Song of the Wind and Trees) is an anime (adapted from a manga) that every shounen-ai fan should watch. Although it has relatively little sexual content and was made as an accompaniment to the manga the artwork and the story are timeless and beautiful.,20507,309,2019-04-13 21:35:40

My favorite anime of all time! Hands down 10/10 Hellsing Inc is at war with an insane general strait from the depths of hell and his army of freaky vampire lackeys. Blood guts sex guns and darkness rains like hellfire and each character is even more insane than the last with Allucard being the best of all.,20533,313,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There is only one word to describe Hellsing:Ultimate. Kick Ass! This series took Hellsing to a whole other level! I enjoyed it  so much that I had to watch the series several times. It was so good!

Let me start with: Hellsing Ultimate is far superior to the first series. The first one didnt even had a normal ending and they didnt even show us a real representation of Alucards true power. Here they learned from their mistakes and created something wigth the same atmophere visuals and characters but I would urge everyone: if you have to choose choose this one.,20547,318,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hellsing Ultimate is ultimately a waste of time. It's the story of the good guys with one vampire called Alucard (it's Dracula only backwards! get it? GET IT?!). In essence it is an infinitely repeating loop of gore and forgetable characters. That being said it is a heavily stylized work with some great character design the Madhouse treatment of the art and in general all about the blood pumping action.,20589,324,2019-04-13 21:35:40

  Okay I'm sorry this is why anime has downgraded sooo much as of late if people honestly think this is good then authers can put whatever they want online and people will like it. And look I'm okay with a fan base for hellsing not giving up on the series but there is no excuse to admire this anime it is complete trash even if you were in love with the first series this was the biggest waste of my time for 2014 and I've seen some bad anime this past year.,20613,326,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime rocks. I wathced it many times ang going to watch gain. There are 7 ova's by now but it will be 10. Now I am waiting for Ova 8. I think it going to be cool. My favourite Characters are Schrodinger Seras Victoria Alucard. The Story in this Anime is awesome. Its about Vampires and theyre conflicts. There are Groups in this anime Like Hellsing organization Last Battalion and Iscariot. Animation is great. What can I say its the best anime I ever Watched. Its Erstaunlich (amazing).,20649,327,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kiss x Sis is a pretty strange story to begin with. Essentially the main male character Keita has two twin sisters that are not actually blood related to him. They want him in the worst way but he's very reluctant at first. As the series progresses he starts to act a little mor impulsively as he tries to get into their high school so they can all be together.,20755,344,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Big Windup! is not an anime I expected to love.  Mostly I started watching it because I thought the animation looked very good -- and it is -- and I liked the character designs.  I'm not a huge fan of sports anime but that's mostly because I'd never really seen one before this -- the genre had never interested me.  I can say now having watched Big Windup! that the sports genre of anime is one I'll be looking into quite a bit more.,20857,360,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime reminds me of a mix of a children's comicbook adventure and a trauamatic dark tale of opression's crush in the disguise of the light.

One day a small girl named Yuzuyu is brought to the Katakura home. Her mother abandoned her for unknown reasons and left her with her sister's family. And instead of stepping up like a normal aunt should she shoves the kid onto the shoulders of her eldest son who need to learn some maturity and they all figured the best way to get his mind off of girls is to make him a parent.,20951,376,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm done with this anime. I went into it expecting something extremely cute and innocent but it just turned out to be overly dark ear-piercing and a tad cloying. The little girl got sad too easily. It just feels like something appealing to older children.,20955,377,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm just going to be frank and say that I almost died several times while watching this anime for no other reason than because of Yuzuyu's unbearable cuteness.  Now that that's out of the way we can move onto other things about the anime.  The story I found to be while yes interesting it did at times come to feel that the problems that were being dealt with in the anime were while serious weren't handled as seriously as they could have been.  Making it feel like the things never got as deep as they could have been.   Also from time to time the series seemed to drag and I spent time waiting for the episode to end so that I could move onto the next episode and hopefully something more interesting or cute.  The animation wasn't all that great and really I can't say anything really all that positive or negative about the animation.  The opening and ending weren't my most favorite things in the whole world not really bad I just didn't like them.  Though the soundtrack that played during episodes was in my opinion to be quite well done and did a fairly nice job in helping to set the mood.  The voice actors were pretty decent though even to this day hearing Yuzuyu's voice still sends my heart a flutter thinking about how cute she is.  The characters were pretty well done though Kippei was prehaps a bit to well done seeing as how he had very few flaws within the story.  The star of the show is of course Yuzuyu who is extremely well written that I fell for her in the first episode.  I can remember when watching this hoping that my own daughter would turn out to be as cute and adorable as her.  Overall I came out of this show not completely loving besides one very special character and at the same time I could not quite come to think of the show as being only average.,20965,381,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Aishiteruze Baby is a testament to how truly strong characterevelopment can take an anime with a relatively simple plot and turn itnto something fantastic.

This anime is so under-rated! It's a crying shame that similar series are in the top 50 anime of this site and they are inferrior to this series. Unlike said similar anime this one actually tells a complete and concise story from start to finish. It has a clear beginning middle and end and doesn't just end suddenly like the other series that is so well loved here. Clearly this is the better series in terms of story. I've intentionally withheld the name of the other series because this review is not about them but instead about Aishiteruze Baby which in my opinion is the best of the  young man suddenly finds himself raising a small child  anime out there.,20973,384,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Without looking at the fact the Anime is over 8 years old its still very normal. not too special and not too good. The story was a good idea but WAY much too dramatic. At much points you could cry but you dont because you know the whole anime is dramatic. but at least 20% of the whole Anime just contained views to older mostly dramatic parts of the Anime :) Ironically meant* the idea about a big war between Evil Legendz and Good Legendz and the DWC is too old existed before already so it isnt something new. a lot of parts where i thought  why did they build it in?  or  why did they even added this? . The beginning was pretty cool but the fun watching it decreased slowly to the end because it wasnt really the same like before it seemed it was like a different one or maybe a new season.,20975,385,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Welcome to James Bond glasses girl edition!  Seriously that's what this show is.  Everything reminded me of a classic 70s spy thriller from the music to the action.  The only difference was superpowers replaced gadgets.  And instead of the suave womanizing master spy we get a typical clumsy book-obsessed curvy glasses girl.  Only in anime.  For those who love those spectacles and spaced-out personalities this is your show.  ,21013,392,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Read or Die is 3 episodes of an action-packed seinen anime about... well... books. Books and action don't go together you might say? Well they do in this anime. Featuring crazy super powers a top secret agency a sprinkle of comedy and a slightly complex story that might warrant this to be a seinen anime it is very unique and possibly niche. Heck the main character has the ability to manipulate paper! But don't let that put you off give it a go. It certainly won't appeal to everyone but it sure can be enjoyable. Oh and no kids in this anime. What a breath of fresh air.,21027,396,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This OVA is an extremely short face paced story featuring people with extremely unique powers. It features some humor and some seriousness at the same time while managing an impressive amount of character development for 3 30 minute episodes. Now if you add that to the obvious James Bond feel that is portrayed from the first OP and add a bunch of evil clones of various geniuses from throughout the centuries you get this series in a nutshell. If you're looking for a nice short mixture of humor super powers and action this is a great series.,21031,397,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My praise for Read or Die may be undeserved but for its one and a half hour run time it is executed in a way such that the laughs tears and dozens of jumps and shouts from the audience will be strung together in quick succession.,21033,398,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Do you like Mark Hammel….ok did you see the dark Hero…hmm well this was my favourite anime in 6th grade and is still awesome it shows a young high school student stumble across a devise which makes him the perfect weapon but its alien creaters want it back will the guyver unit be enough to defeat chronos? well seeing as this isn't the physical movie then I think its bloody possible.old school face melting bloody spewing and intestine ripping goodness nothing like it out there ,21037,399,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Good for a quick giggle (3 min. eps). A large-breated kawaii assasin works the front desk of a Hotel in downtown Tokyo. The animation is cheesy looking but that's OK for what this is. ,21055,403,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just a short one minute clip made in 1989 displaying all the previous gundam series. Made for the 10th anniversary of the original Gundam and also a promotion for Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket.,21059,404,2019-04-13 21:35:40
These little bits of Attack on Titan give off a much more domestic and cute feel to the show with the chibi style and the characters childish behavior. The six-sevenish minuites of the show is filled with the characters being dumb or childish being put into situations cliché to slice of life/high school shows and frequent visits from the colassal titan. It includes the fact that most of them are still hormone ridden teenagers as well as students and kids that want to socialize. It still includes a bit of titan slaying or training excersises but is more focused on the comedy and slice of life feel.,21065,405,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A much more realistic take on mecha in the not-to-distant future. Lots and lots of politics so it can get very complicated. A very serious and sober anime. The story has a lot of intrigue but it may come across as stale at times.,21073,408,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I first looked at Hayate no Gotoku I definitely didn't expect it to be a show I'd end up enjoying. Just look at the plot: a boy goes to work for a 13 year-old girl as a fighting butler in order to pay off his debt. Then there's the whole stupid romance aspect a talking tiger a cross-ressing Hayate flat characters (I'm not talking about Hinagiku) and a plot that NEVER advances. On paper this should spell disaster. I mean if a show like this took itself seriously even for a second there's no way it could work right? Right. Good thing it didn't.,21081,411,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I can only think of one word to describe Hayate no Gotoku and it describes the show quite well. The word is ‘wow’. Yes wow or maybe awesome would fit. The amount of comedy references and spoofs in it is simply amazing. Not only has it got an interesting story great characters and character mix but the way they incorporate other anime is brilliant.,21085,412,2019-04-13 21:35:40
From the get go this story feels so totally unreasonable and unrealistic to be remotely grounded in reality you may wonder what sort of reality this is reflecting.  There is no obvious suggestion it is an alternate reality other than the outrageous way a child is expected to pay for mistakes by his overly irresponsible and worthless parents who not only leave him with debts but completely abandon him in addition.  Even if this were true what bass akwards government would ever be ridiculous enough to hold a child responsible for someone's problem who was supposed to be responsible for him?  The bizzare totally illogical fantasy setting aside and if you can get passed how senseless this setting and setup is the story is not to shabby.,21089,413,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Maoyu could have been many things including  boring  and  a waste of time  if the creative staff behind this fantasy/history genre-bender hadn't put in as much work as they did. The show is cut from many familiar even over-familiar cloths but the synthesis of all these elements has resulted in a series that feels fresh and light – a considerable step above the mire in which fantasy anime typically drowns.,21119,420,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Minami-ke Okaeri is the 3rd season of the Minami-ke slice-of-life comedy series Okaeri being the Japanese word to return home. I don’t see what’s so ‘return home’ about this since it retains the disappointing animation of the second season. But at least the things that matter are still there it’s still as funny and heart-warming as ever and it’s more of the comical shenanigans of the Minami sisters and their friends. I’ll disclose the fact that I reviewed the first season rather favourably and that I might have been a bit too harsh on the 2nd season due to that animation. I will be referring to those reviews for a few sections.,21163,424,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is probably one of the most random animes out there but still a favorite of many.  The Story revolves around multiple characters in the beginning Fuyuki who is just your average guy that is obsessed about supernatural things Natsumi the short tempered chick that has some serious cans of kick-ass locked away somewhere...  And out beloved Sergeant Keroro the quirky sergeant that comes up with plans to pay off his massive debt and spends his entire weapon budget on cheap gundam models.  The Plot wait... What? no plot? what kind of an anime is this then!!? the original plot is about Keroro and his Platoon (Code named A.R.M.P.I.T.) trying to take over the world known as Pekopon (which is secretly earth but don't tell anyone I said that >_>).  Later on you meet the rest of A.R.M.P.I.T. Corporal Giroro the gunslinger who's trigger finger is as fiery as his short fuse and love for Natsumi; Sergeant Major Kululu the mad scientist who has a slight perverted nature and is hysterically sadistic; Private Second Class Tamama the cute one of the platoon who has SERIOUS Split personality syndrome and has an obsessive crush in the Sergeant Keroro(which reoccurs throughout the series); Lance Corporal Dororo Who is a ninja that loves the planet and hope for instead of enslaving Pekoponians but causeing world peace and harmony; everyone forgets his existence.  And Finally the horrible the devastating the one being that will make you fall out of your chair THE LORD OF TERROR NAMED ANGOL MOIS! wait... The lord of terror is a chick and a tan blonde one at that? and her weapon that can destroy the world in 3 minutes is a cell phone? (it isn't even an Iphone...)  moving on since Sergeant is such a lovable idiot he never does anything to move forward in the conquering of Ear- sorry  Pekopon.  anyway If you like semi-serious anime then watch the Japanese dub but if you love obscure references whether it be about Google random actors and other pop-culture then watch the English Dub.,21179,427,2019-04-13 21:35:40
(My opinion everyone) ,21185,428,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Note: I did not read the manga yet (20 Sept. 2014) so for now I don't care what happens in there. All I know is what I saw and what I decided to ignore. Like for example the last episode. It had a fulfilling ending though don't mind me..,21189,429,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Black butler is up on my favorites list too ,21195,430,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I am absolutely in LOVE with season ! It the story ties the other 2 seasonw well all characters are present and it flows and pulls you in EACH EPISODE ! The new characters are full of stories and are very colorful. It still has that grim success feeling ! ,21201,431,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,21215,432,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Some Spoilers Ensue...,21235,433,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Where to start.. Kuroshitsuji aka Black Butler is one of my favourite anime's definitely in my top 5. Which is why I decided to write a review on one of my favourite arcs! It follows the manga closely (though I've seen the anime first before reading it in the manga). Sebastian Michaelis a demon loved by almost all women he's probably one of our favourite fictional crushes. This was the arc  Book of Circus  where Ciel is ordered by the Queen to find out why children in the city are mysteriously disappearing and infiltrate the circus and work as team members to find out what happened to them. ,21241,434,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It was more like a side story point for the anime series. The way the anime series was presented in Season 1 and season 2 was way more deeper and also more in-depth. ,21255,435,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not bad for a short arc.,21267,436,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It seems more interesting than the other two seasons mostly because there are more characters in it. I was a little dissapointed from the fact that Ciel seems less i-am-never-surprised-i-never-laugh-never-show-emotion-im-not-a-kid-anymore and I have connected him with that attitude. It has a lot of potential in my opinion.,21273,437,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,21275,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was soooo boring. Some of the pictures looked like fanartists drew them. This would have been worth it if there was some really nice character development but really I didn't see that it was needed at all. I guess if you are a guy and like to see some of the female characters in sexy pictures go for it.,21293,441,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,21295,442,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The animation was great but idk if I was that drawn in by the storyline...,21297,443,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I rather liked Yami no Matsuei. It's an older anime so the animation and character designs look kind of weird compared to more modern things but it's still worth watching once you get over the late 1990's feel. However the artwork for the end credits is pretty. The anime is split into 4 story arcs and all of them (I think) revolve around a couple of shinigami and a really annoying bird thing chasing after this evil doctor guy in white.,21305,444,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a beautiful anime and a really great story if you like the more supernatural elements. My one and only suggestion about watching this anime is DO NOT watch the dub. It's a complete butcher of the voices.,21325,445,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was very good and it could have gotten a higher rating from me except that at the end the main antagonist became a old power crazed king who wanted to destroy the enitire universe. Like what are you supposed to do with that. I think that ruined the entire story. All the other chracters did a fantastic job except for this old man with a f**ked up voice who wanted to destroy the universe and everything within. I think that the plot of the story was very good because it had a lot of twists and turns. Overall this anime did a really good job.,21327,446,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i like ecchi anime because of the jokes that comes from it like the start of to-love-ru where they end up naked in the locker and the girl the guy loves sees them i like thar kind of jokes alot but here there is a hot girl inside a fugly robot and the nice girl's Personality turns into a freak with costume fetish (for her self not him) y maybe some other ppl would like this kind but for me its fustrating so if you like the hot girls ecchi anime i guess this isn't it,21329,447,2019-04-13 21:35:40

yes yes i reated this all very well but i have come out of watching this anime seriously disturbed sickened revolted shocked disappointed and i now have no clue what the hell is happening in this anime! if someone can please explain what the hell or even why they released such a psychopathic anime! i enjoyed the neon evangelion apart from the ep 24 onwards but i really am lost with this now can someone please explain this to me it might be because i am only 16 but nothing has really hit me this bad EVER my understanding is zero i hope someone can convice me that this is a good anime by explain to me.,21373,454,2019-04-13 21:35:40
OKay I am an Asuka fan and I am here to complain about Asuka and how she got pushed to the sidelines. She is my favorite character and I don't like what they did to her. It was too torturous they ruined her eye and her Eva REALLY BADLY and Shinji just got even more hateful by going crazy crying and even choking her at the end (gladly she didn't die).,21393,455,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Where can I begin with The End of evanglion a film so insane so crazy and so well you get the idea.  From the begin the series took me by the hand and took me on an unforgettable ride through it's world.  The animation was fantastic for the time and same goes for the musical score.  The story itself was out of the norm with giant heads to robots in space.  End of Eva defines the series with an even more confusing ending than the series ending itself.  Personally I enjoyed the ending to the film to me it was a fitting end. Who would habe thought it to be the END! Ironic right?  The ending to the film has been ripped to shreds with Asuka back to life and if you notice with the same bandages as Rei had in the first episode.  The ending even though said is a fitting end for the two heronines they sit hand in hand togehter on the beach only to wait there end.  What could possibly happen to our two heros?  Maybe this is what Shinji wanted to live in a world full of peace with no fighting no war and no father.  A world where only he can exist with his true love.,21395,456,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This movie is based of an excellent anime but unfortunately the ending is so terrible and annoying it's almost unbearable. The main character through out the whole anime is always sad and worried about the world around and people not praising him but this is written in a way it is NOT irritating. This movie ends with this character crying which is overwhleming annoying. The original ending to this anime is quite good as it ties up all the loose strings and leaves you with no questions to ask just sit there and go wow they finally caught a break.,21405,457,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,21407,458,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't really understand how this anime has so much ranking. It is a big dissapointment for me. Maybe it presented  new ideas  for mecha anime for its time but there are better anime out there now that is more worth watching. It begins ok but toward the end changes its format and it just becomes a methaphisical mambo jambo. The End of Evangelion Movie tries to explain their theories a little bit better but even so they just vomit a long monologue of bullsh** that even if you understand what the author is trying to say its going to leave you with the question  So what's so great abut that? . There is nothing to be impress by this anime the hero has the most patetic personality ever and I rather recommend you to skip this anime or you will be dissapointed or rather  feeling disgusted  as the own series says at the end. ,21409,459,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie is a waste of time in relations to the TV series and ashis is how it wants to be seen (title: END OF EVANGELION) it is aroblem. It does not bring anything new to the story that is worth yourime. On a personal level I think Evangelion should have ended atpisode 24. The last two episodes of the series and this do not dovangelion justice at all. This movie cannot be completely symbolic ift did not abandon itself to the concept from the start (here thetarting point would have to be the series). Ultimately this is whatails Evangelion. I do not know why the director has bothered making aovie that answers some questions but has the most feeble answers toive.,21437,467,2019-04-13 21:35:40

You'll have to forgive me for not making this review an entire novel but I prefer to be clear and make my reviews short. Now onto this movie which I had waited a long time to finally see (english dub). The story was mediocre. It clung on to the same principle and tried to over-use the whole  change the world to make it a better place  theme. Ed and Al were still awesome but here the relationship they shared with other main characters like Roy Mustang was terribly morphed. I know that in the actual series there was never a true established friendship but in the movie it almost seemed like the colonel hated Ed with a passion oh well. Other than that they way they did the animation  bugged the crap out of me the hair looked like shit kind of spaghetti noodle tips and such. Still i'm a hardcore FMA fan and I had to watch it just to see who's ass Ed would kick.,21451,471,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's ironic.  The reason I didn't go watch this movie when it first came out was because I didn't like the animation style from the trailers yet the animation is probably one of the best features of this train wreck of a movie despite a few issues here and there.,21467,472,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It’s approaching midnight and I’m dead tired so the three minutes that was Vampire Holmes could have been a nightmare of some sort. After all I’ve spent much of the day watching anime so it’s only natural my brain would rebel. It started with this theme song that is kind of like my worst fear theme for any anime. There was some Engrish about “everlasting love”. To make matters worse this was followed by an actual program.,21517,490,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is truely a masterpiece of an animation. The story is truly fantastic and everything is completly logical. The animation is flawless the character design is perfect in almost everyway. The animators clearly look their time to put in an astonishingly large amount of detail in ever aspect. The music and the voice acting cannot be any better. Holmes and Hudson are clearly very complex and have deep souls there is so much that can be done to progress them but they are complely perfect on their own. I would rate this show to be among the titans of the indistry! To stand among the AoT FLCL Gurren Lagann and Fullmetal Alchemist.,21521,491,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At first glance this looked to be an anime along the same style as Blade Runner with the initial problem in episode 1 about robots becoming self aware. however it quickly turned into a long journey story like Pokemon. hey this episode we're in THIS city lets deal with danger here. Now on to another city with more danger repeat to death. Good animation and music only thing that had me finish watching it.,21549,498,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ergo Proxy initially builds a highly interesting world but its story does it no justice and ultimately ends up destroying it.,21563,503,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched 8 episodes to date and Im pretty sure that the series already showed me everything it has to offer. I will finish it eventually but it will take a lot of time and it better to write a review before I forget more than I know. ,21569,504,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ergo Proxy is one of those series where you either like it or you don't. For one not only is the japanese highly difficult for the subbers but watching the series itself proves to be very difficult. For those who have a wikipedia-esque knowledge base Ergo Proxy comes as an intellectual delight.,21571,505,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This one is definitely worth the high 8. With the Earth a barren wasteland and people living in refined domes robots are common however they are going rogue a young low level is forced into meeting the mayors daughter and they uncover the history of the proxy named 1. Good watch,21575,507,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ergo Proxy is one of those shows you can just watch in between the series you are waiting to really get to. It's not great but it isn't terrible it's a watch and forget in my opinion..which with my memory is most animes anyway.,21587,508,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have to say of all the anime I have seen this is by far the worst.  Don't get me wrong it started out wonderfully the first few episodes had me hooked and seemed like it was bound to be amazing.  I was wrong.  This is a clear example of an anime that had the potential to be one of the best and somewhere it all went wrong.  Please read the review before watching the show.,21591,509,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ergo Proxy is a very confusing series and you have a lot questions even after completing the series. But I think that's part of the magic of it.,21595,510,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,21597,511,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show I can honestly say was one of the biggest let downs of anime shows I've seen yet. The first episode draws you in pretty good but after that it goes completely downhill. Most of the episodes (especially the finale) were incredibly confusing and didn't make any sense. They did try to make the characters seem intelligent but failed pretty badly. The few things I did enjoy were the Gothic character design and animation along with the proxy characters. Another big letdown was the fact they frequently drifted from the main plot. You can take episode 15 for example when the episode began with the characters on a game show not letting the viewer know how the hell they got there and why they were there in the first place. Don't get me wrong if I could change time and go back I would still go through and watch this show. It has many bad things about it but the animation like I said before is stunning and worth the watch. As for the number of episodes I think they could have lowered it to around 10-15 episodes instead of 23.,21599,512,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ergo Proxy has proven to be a series that you either love or hate.  I personally found this series intoxicating and feel it is a series that everyone should at least give a shot.  The storyline is very interesting to say the least.  It does have a couple of severe misses however.  The bookstore episode isn't that good and the quiz show episode is one of the strangest things I've seen in an anime.  The animation is beautiful.  If you like anime with a gothic feel this is the show for you.  This series combines gothic elements with a cyberpunk future very elegantly.  The animation is not this shows best feature however.  The OP is beyond catchy and the entire soundtrack is extemely well done.  The ending theme fits the series as well and is almost as good as the opening.  Finally the characters are very interesting.  Re-L Vincent and Pino (the main characters) all develop relatively well througout the series.  Some of the supporting cast ends up a little flat however.  I feel that that everyone should check this series out if just for the beautiful animation and soundtrack.,21603,513,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ergo Proxy while having its moments of promise ultimately reveals the poverty of designing a series to fit a particular length. With an attention demanding initial episode and some standard of quality until episode 3 it can be hard to stop watching even as the series reveals that it didn't really have an idea where it was going after all.,21641,517,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ergo Proxy! How dare a show demand my admiration and then as soon as you fit your oily fingers around it's throat you turn into such a let down! I have never seen a series start off so strongly to have such a week progression.,21647,518,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm going to keep this nice and short and save those from the agony that awaits those who dive into this anime. This anime is really confusing. Thats putting it in short terms. Like many other reviewers the first episode had me hooked and eager to continue watching but as many have stated the anime just seems to drop off after a few episodes (1-4). What really made me drop this anime was getting to episode 20. If you so choose to watch this anime you are surely to run into many bumps and hiccups when trying to even comprehend whats going on.,21663,522,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ergo proxy has an interesting world in which it takes place that I enjoyed exploring.  The story sucked me in real quick and kept me watching.  The problem I have with it is that it is 23 episodes and that nearly ruined it for me.  If the anime was only 12 episodes long by taking out the filler that made it go so slowly and feel like 50 episodes than I'd give it 4 maybe 4.5 stars out of 5 insteal of 2.  If you like the themes and can handle all the filler and are fine with slow anime I highly recommend this anime.  If you can't stand filler or slow anime but like the themes than I still recommend you give this one at least a try.,21667,523,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"It had a bit of potential as a very short anime but It just completely stabs itself. It feels like it's needlessly dragged on and on with such a slow pace and then it has an episode where you can barely keep up with what's going on. It hardly explains anything at all and most key components of the anime are just not explained at all or developed. The anime only has 23 episodes yet most of them are fillers. And even the fillers aren't really interesting because they're just random things happening that hardly have any sort of essence and lead up to absolutely nothing at all (at least most of them). Characters hardly get any development. And the characters are very few to begin with. It started bad because it didn't really introduce the audience into anything and it ended on the same note. All this time it constantly feels like a try-hard wanna-be anime. It feels like the creator of this story was some sort of hipster with too much money who wanted to appear so deep and make a story which made people think but the anime makes you think about absolutely nothing at all because it has no essence whatsoever. It's interesting... how can you talk so much and yet leave the audience so confused and bored? And the whole anime just circles the same loop 1000 times. If you want watch an anime and learn how an anime should ***NOT*** be I definitely recomend you to watch this. If you are someone who wants to appear smart this is the anime for you. If you are smart this is not for you. I suggest watching the movie  shutter island . I also suggest comparing this anime to  one piece  and be amazed at how such a short anime can mess up the storyline and be so boring compared to another one which is so long and captivate the audience. It's like they are polar opposites. The animation for  Ergo proxy  is good tho and there's hardly anything that would really iritate me but it was kinda sad and pathetic while watching episode 22 because I could even feel the animators getting bored and starting to draw the characters worse. As for sound... nothing annoying but nothing that would get stuck in your mind. In fact I can't remember a single song in this anime except the intro/outro. And there's only one of each too. As a last note this is just my opinion and I'm fairly confident that this is a bad anime but I suggest you form your own opinion and try to figure out if it's true that there's overall two groups of people after watching this anime... the dumb hipsters who want to appear smart and say  ergo proxy  is amazing and the 2nd group who actually seen what a good anime looks like. I suggest debating by bringing up valid points and just drop the conversation if they bring up something like  I liked how it looked and felt and my faith is that it was nice ",21679,526,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I watched Ergo Proxy online because of a review I saw on Amazon.com. I liked it because the pacing of the show was slow and it required that you actually pay attention to what's going on. It takes its time to let the world unfold and I like the fact that it didn't lay everything out for you at the very beginning.The only really negative thing I had to say was that the DVD itself was a little too dark as far as the picture is concerned. the darker colors just didn't seem to translate well on my TV which could be just the excuse I need to by a better one.

" I think therefore I am.  Sounds like nonsense to you? Ergo Proxy is (in my opinion) a cyperpunk post-apocalyptic seinen anime that reminded me a lot of the movie Aeon Flux. To put things simply it is about the journey of self-discovery for the main characters involved and can be very confusing. It isn't explained perfectly well and some things are purposefully left out or made to be vague. The implementation is flawed yet I enjoyed it immensely. My head hurts now that I've seen it. And I almost fell asleep whilst watching the last few episodes similarly to my experience with Neon Genesis Evangelion. However this anime somehow is able to be more complex and contrived than that classic. It may take a while to explain what this anime is but in short its a psychological experience with a plot about uncovering the truth in a post apocalyptic setting. It's been months since my last review but this anime is so interesting I just had to write about it.",21743,538,2019-04-13 21:35:40

well in my opinion it was evident that this series was rushed to it's conclusion for instance that one battle where I think they suppose to kill the queen or something don't remember there was time lapse or time skip between day and night. Been awhille since I  watched it so I don't remember it in details but I can say this more could have been done with it leading up to the that half cliffhanger ending episode where Kisara revenge obsession darkside finally surfaced out of the blue after kill her first target without second thought and then seemly going insane and switching to light atmosphere and tears. although not such a bad ending but the way it was lead up and throw out there honestly that kinda did caught me off guard there. If should recommend this to anyone I might not,21763,543,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Premise? Sounded great as it reminded me of Attack on Titan's premise a series that Black Bullet has been compared to quite often because of the similar vibe. Humanity fenced off and protected by giant walls against an enemy that is nearly impossible to defeat and the only saviors are the ones humanity hates most. In AoT it was people who could turn into Titans in Black Bullet's case it is not people who turn into Gastrea but loli called the cursed children who have superhuman powers due to their hybrid blood. Okay so this show is pandering to the lolicons even though it's suppose to sound serious. It's difficult to take a story based around humanity's near hopeless battle against monsters seriously when those fighting on the front lines are literally a bunch of ten year old little girls. Alright I don't mind loli in anime but in this case it just didn't match up properly but that's not the worst of it.,21833,554,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The sequel to Hiiro no kakera was very good because the romance develops between Tamaki and Takuma and there is alot more action with more interesting plot lines. I was dissapointed that they changed the opening song although the new one is also fairly good. I would recomend you watch this anime as a follow on from the first series because alot more is explained that was left in the previous episodes. The ending is really good because you finally get to see the full transformations of the charactors. You have to wait untill the final episodes to see this though.,21861,561,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Seriously one of my favorite anime. Music is good although the characters are silent. It's sort of a cross between Professor Layton and the American show Adventure Time as odd as that sounds.,21863,562,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: We start off with our protagonist Shiroe who finds himself trapped in Elder Tales which becomes the new reality for the 30000 players in the MMO. The first problem that they are faced with in the their new world is that they are having trouble adapting to it so Shiroe attempts to form the Round Table Alliance to make Akihabara a better place cope in. Later on Shiroe forms a guild called  Log Horizon  to better help his friends in need. The background story of the game is well fleshed out giving better insights leading to the series of events that happens in the game. The politics that they go in like influencing League of Freedom Cities Eastal to learn more about the People of the Land is somewhat entertaining. Where Log Horizon's plot is at it's strongest is focus on the evolving overworld like how NPCs change over time including their interactions with the adventurers. Some of the in-game mechanics are also a part of the story with some twists like the anomaly of discovering subclasses having more potential.,21891,569,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really feel like the tag POLITICAL should be here the main character is genious the way he manipulates both the enviroment and others that happen to be in power that's what got me hooked. Sure I like a bit of fantasy or stuck in a game world but my favorite part of this show was just how he planned everything If you've read and like the Artemis Fowl Series then you would quite like this. :D,21925,572,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love the intellegence of the main character. He is always 100 steps in front of everyone else he always takes you by surprise. The story line takes a bit to get goin not helped by the fact there are only 15 episodes and some which go a lot more in depth than most anime will but it is great when you pay attention to some of that little stuff. If all you want is battles go elsewhere. If you really want a story but like battles too then stay. ,21935,574,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First of all i've watched this because some people keep talking about Log Horizon. To my surprise it wasn't that bad. The range of classes for every character is unique; main class sub class magics equipments crafting and command skills. It really takes me back to my MMO Days. The story is half good half dissappointing. Its almost as if 25 episodes was put to waste with a simple write up. But giving it a 2nd season means that i will be expecting something :),21941,577,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hi there guys and gals my names Chris and today am going to be talk about log horizon. As you probably know by now log horizon is an anime based on massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).

I have never written a review before but I felt I needed to with this one. To start with I should say that for me its mostly the opening song and first few minutes that get my attention. A good plot and story line along with the voice actors are also a good selling point however I have to say that while the idea was good I found that actual anime its self below expectations.,21967,588,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The biggest problem was everything was too dark. The bad guys are often referred to as  Roaches . The only thing really at all roach like is that they have antenae. Other than that they look like 8 foot tall crazy eyed African body builders...,21981,593,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I initially picked this anime out of a simple random choice restrictod to Sci Fi stuff and well it gave me some nice grounds for a story I might appreciate.,21995,594,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is awesome! If you like against impossible odds blood and people being torn apart. It makes since to me beside the organ thing. But most sci fy shows will have some sort oabstract ideal. It's great! Watch some of they action and try to tell me otherwise,22031,598,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Terra Formars,22037,600,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm an avid follower of the Terra Formars series and I was very hyped to hear the manga was getting an anime adaption. Here is my indepth review of the anime adaption based on 3 episodes released so far.,22039,601,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of those where you need to read the manga to get the answers you want. There's nearly  no closure towards the ending the main character reminds the viewer that no matter what setbacks are put on them they wil prevail. This is probably one of the only stories that made me want to read the manga. Its a pretty good anime overall I liked it a lot.,22043,602,2019-04-13 21:35:40

To be honest this anime started of rather slow and I didn't really find myself enjoying it after watching the first episode however I dont give up on things and so I pushed away that boredm and continued to watch this series and I'm glad I did because it did get better. I have read quite a few reviews that say the music was I'll concieves but really  it does depend on the music you enjoy. Someone who dislikes rock will find the music to be i'll fitting and more likely than not it will ruin the series for them. Zombie-loan isn't something I'd typically watch because I'm not too fond of zombies due to finding them rather bothersome but as this anime progressed I found myself enthralled. The story follows that of a young girl who can see the ring of death around a person's neck if they are fated to die soon or as she learns later if someone is actually dead. This realization is brought about by two boys who  survived  a horrific car accident. But Miss Kita soon discovers that Shito and Chicka are zombies who kill the so called illegal zombies in order to pay of their debts. Miss Kita finds herself caught up with these two boys and soon finds herself indebted to them. With her sight  the two boys realise it will be easier to pay off their debt and thus begins the trials of Miss Kita and her ties to Z - loan  the company to which Shito and Chicka owe their lives too are formed. This anime isn't for everyone and it does have its fare share of bad reviews as their are some weird scenes within the anime but it does have a very interesting plot especially when unknown zombies are given illegal contracts. This is a highly interesting anime and I really enjoyed the plot line once i got passed my initial boredm.  If you do proceed to watch the most sound advice I can give is that it does get better as it progresses.,22055,605,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First thing you'll notice its short (or if you're a big nerd like me the real First thing you'll noticed is that square enix was backing this anime). After that you'll be busy trying to get a grip on the characters and then they throw you into the action which as you'll find out has a bit of a twist (which is strange but i like it). So to keep this review short characters are neat but a little paper thin its short HAS POTENTIAL looks nice if you want a little action some small plot holes (maybe they'll be answered in time) and some zombie action (doesn't exactly mean what you think) watch this its not bad.,22059,607,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hmmm...with what should i start ....Zombie Loan is average animetheir characters are like normal comedy this daystherefore it has its own advantages.,22071,610,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Zombie-Loan based on the manga of the same name by Peach-Pit....A story I began to read 2 years ago in 2009 and that fascinated me back then. I never had the opportunity to watch the anime before...and now it's done my thoughts are a bit mixed about it.,22081,611,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Traige X really wasn't that bad once you face the facts that this series to anyway is a run of the mill series. I would put it up there with it being as run of the mill Akame ga Kill I just wonder with it having simliar overal themes and better characters on paper why people love Akame ga Kill yet hate this series.,22117,618,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm going to disagree with those who feel this season is  padded  (with the exception of the recap episode which I just skipped since I binged all the episodes). If you enjoyed the first season and are giving the second a shot you should be on board. After the initial handful of episodes in the first season I adjusted to the pace so I knew what to expect here. For me there's nothing  extra ; everything either adds to the tension or develops characters.,22145,625,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Boobs. Plenty of 'em in all shapes and sizes. Bouncing and jiggling across the screen and fan-service for just about everything (Not simply limited to maid outfits). The first few minutes set the tone and pace of the show with the male lead accidentally grabbing a fistful of some big'uns. It's really not meant to be taken seriously as one should just revel and ride the waves of ecchi.,22167,632,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you're like me   then you will definitely like this anime,22169,633,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a thrilling ride. The plot is very well done but it is very subtle and the action generally puts the character development in the background. For those that want some action to go with their dystopian post apocalypse thought experiments this is a good opportunity.,22171,634,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well i dont even know where to begin... the animation itself is good exept that the plot is wery tightly placed inside some 11 min episodes that dosent have time to properly explayn for instance the 1 st episode just sort of explayns what is hapening in the world and why. And of course how humans or i should say the mayn characters deal with the problem. Just a warning dont rate this anime just on the first episode because i did not think that it has so mutch plot cramped in those 11 min that it makes a bit of hard to go on from one ep. They should have gone and made the episodes 30 min's  but theres no use crying ower spiled milk. ,22173,635,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In this wild west anime Harlock and Tochiro are gunslinging wanderers in desolate wasteland. They meet up with a mysterious woman upon escape from aorrupt town. The animation in this series is bizarre. Many characters have eyeshat are ridiculously close together and their heads are peanut-shaped makinghem resemble horses. It wasn't a bad story overall though.,22181,639,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay first of all I'm giving this a high score because I think it's truly a great mixture of of what has made Leiji Matsumoto's stories great.  I was first hooked by Galaxy Express when I saw it on the Sci Fi channel in the early 90s and since then I've seen everything I can get my hands on from more GE999 Harlock and all the other stories in the Leijiverse.,22189,640,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"On a fateful summer afternoon I was bored. I was in the mood to watch anime but didn't have any that I wanted to watch. So appropriately as it would turn out I randomly chose a show off Crunchyroll's summer lineup just to see if it was good. I watched the first episode. My reaction in a word:  lolwut?  My reaction in a sentence:  There needs to be a better word for 'random'. ",22231,648,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One word to describe Nichijou is simply random but i would like to say it was a very unique experience in itself and once you got past the sheer randomness of it you start to realize the comedic nature of it.,22239,649,2019-04-13 21:35:40

*To provide the viewer with more in-depth analysis I have written some spoilers. These spoilers won't really affect the watching experience at all since this show is not really about the story but the entertainment itself*,22265,654,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I must say i love this anime. the story and characters are well thought off and shows the story on the road to succes. If you like sports anime I recommend you watching this anime since it's fun.,22273,656,2019-04-13 21:35:40
At the beginning I didn't even look at this show because of the description that Crunchyroll gave me. It led me to believe that it was another incest romance show. I really did not want to watch one of those shows. The colorful colors and the shape of Umaru also misled me to believe that. When I caught up with a lot of the shows I've been watching I somehow decided I'd give this one a go and I absolutely love it now. And just to be clear it's not incest. ,22275,657,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before I watched Himouto I read a couple of chapters from the manga a couple of months before the episode and I knew that the anime would be great too. So was it?,22279,658,2019-04-13 21:35:40
CAUTION: The next anime can be very very addictive.,22293,659,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm hooked since the very first episode. My brother suggested this anime and I can say I'm glad he did. The storyline is easy to follow and Umaru is so adorable.,22295,660,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This review is just based off the first episode but I'm caught up with the manga and regularly check it which the anime follows nearly 100%.,22297,661,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Thus far one of the best sports animes I have had the pleasure in watching. One of the biggest strength of Ace Of Diamond is the variety of interesting characters and how much time is being spent developing the characters aside from the main character Sawamura. It's an enjoyable anime I would highly recommend.,22327,665,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story follows Sawamura Eijun as he matures into a  awesome and realiable  pitcher for the Seido High School baseball team. So its a normal baseball anime that has traninning and matches but the thing I like about this it that it is moving and its kinda of realistic. Usually for most sport animes they keep the core characters even though they are suppose to  graduate  end of season. (SPOILERS AHEAD!) But this the 3rd years do really  move on  and they introduce new characters. The introducing of new characters is more on the season 2 but at the end of the season it shows how the new team forms. ,22329,666,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First of all since its been a while since I watched the earlyepisodes to kick the series off and it's too long to watch even half of the series this will be a condensed review.,22335,667,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overall a very enjoyable watch so much so that I finished it within a week or so despite being too busy to watch anime lately. It does remind me of a couple of other anime so not everything is unique but I think it does a good job standing out from the others by the divergence from the usual let's say pace at then end of the story (I don't want to ruin anything by saying more). It also finds a way for something funny to happen every once in a while without it feeling forced. The opening and ending themes are different but very good especially the first ending song. The quality of the animation was pretty good no complaints there. The characters appear to be static at first but after rewatching a few episodes with my Dad I realized just how much they have changed. I'm probably going to buy the whole manga series since it is definitly worth $4 or $5 each (used on Amazon). When I get and read manga series I will post review on that. Anyways it's a very good anime so give it a try and I hope you'll enjoy it. :),22359,670,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I personally did not like how the story became during around esp 10 because it got way off track of what the story begen with. Well its hard to explain while not spoiling it but the show starts to become weird and changes everything that in the show !!!!!      ,22391,675,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't know why i like this anime so much but i do. I love the superpower theme and it's a very interesting twist to it. It is very special powers and they all have wird conditions that makes it funny. The story is also very good. It is about friendship and fighting and it has this tournament going so if you don't like that it is not sure that you will like it but you should still give it a try. It really is a good anime and the story apart from the fighting is funny and amusing. I kind of wish even though it is an comedy anime that there would be a little bit more serious sometimes when it comes to what happends outside of the fighting but that is just personal opinion. I love the Ueki character. Is is very charming and inspiering. When you watch him it makes you want to do all you can for your friends too. It is actually kind of touching sometimes. I will not reveal what it was and by the way if you don't want me to ruin the obvious that happends in the end you should not read this last bit. Well what really toutched me was what Ueki used his null zai on. I won't say what is was but that kind of suprised me coming from a fighting comedy anime. All in all this anime is worth watching. And how hard Ueki is trying for his friends is admirable.,22393,676,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't really understand why other reviews describe Hatsukoi Limited so negativly. I someone who is NOT a big fan of the romance genre enjoyed this anime immensely. It has a unique story line focusing on the individual story of each of the main characters. I don't know about you but I love that kind of thing. And in the end all of the stories clash together for one great big grand finale. It was a rather sweet anime. It started out kind of iffy for me but the more I watched the more it grew on me. It's one of the few anime I've seen where a character starts with one personality and due to what happens throughout the anime changes completely - for the better. But the thing about these characters that makes it truly great is even though they start the way they do they aren't unlikeable. Through out the anime each story ultimately teaches you that no matter what happens it's all about what's on the inside and to believe in yourself in the guise of fluffy love stories. Not unbearably fluffy but enough to make feel the warm fuzzies you know? Also the story as a whole left me sad that it ended. The merging of the different stories worked in such a way that no loose ends were left untied. I finished that anime with a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. Definitely something I'd recommend to others. ,22417,682,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In 9 of 10 cases if you bring a good romance material to J.C.Staff they will create a very enjoyable show (though somehow cliche). They just have to skill to make unoriginal stuff shine (I consider ZnT 3rd some sort of mistake maybe they were drunk all the time while making it or somehow watched too much Eiken and it influenced him in a bad way...). That's why I went to watch this with high expectations and Hatsukoi Limited didn't disapoint me. ,22421,684,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Even though these scores are pretty low I really do recommend you watch this one. This anime basically teaches you that looks aren't important and there are plenty of twists. also if you have ever watched  Lovely Complex  their is a situation in this anime similar to it. Definately watch this if you are a romantic/comedy anime lover!,22427,685,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If I were to have read the plot I would think that this show would beeally generic and uninteresting. Somehow only one of those were true.t seemed generic but I couldn't help but think it was reallynteresting. Maybe it was the large amount of cute girls that kept mynterest. A lot of the show felt like fillers which is odd for a showf only 12 episodes long. There were a lot of episodes where itntroduced a new romance but never focused on them later on in thehow. Even in the last episode it only focused on about half of them.hat about the girl that was on the swimming team? It felt as if theyust introduced her possible romance but never did anything with it.verall a good show but they just tried to stuff too much into it.,22429,686,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you read the description and thought tihs anime would have played out as it you hoped you have been mislead like I was. Honestly the description needs to be changed saying that instead of revolving around the girl and the two brothers each episode focuses on other characters. I give it a 3.5 and I dropped it after episode 5 I couldn't stand watching any more.  Hopefully you read this before getting mislead and wasting your time and getting bored and ticked off at the storyline like I did.,22433,687,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before starting this series I had the assumption that the story wouldn't get far considering that it was only 12 episodes. The story is full of one sided love and a few of love triangles. Every episode seemed to be focused on a different relationship(except one that is continuous throughout the series). Some of the episodes had its moments where it made me smile. Though some of the humor was quite generic it actually was suitable in the situations. Uncommon in the genre I mentioned that there were plenty of relationships going on. It seemed awkward to picture considering it was 12 episodes. It seemed that numerous relationships were just slapped on as filler (filler from what?). So most of the relationships wouldn't even matter to the viewer because they happened so fast. background music was not rememorable as if I did not realize if I had heard any while watching it. Animation and sound was clean and standard. Characters were standard(though the girl with the brother complex was slightly interesting.),22435,688,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I finished watching Natsuyuki Rendezvous for the second time last night. And after reading some of the other reviews I felt the need to write one myself. I understand what the other reviewers complain about but nonetheless I don't agree and I think instead that this anime is a good watch. I wanted to watch something nice and romantic character-based and gentle; so I felt compelled to watch this anime again which is all of those things. I actually think the first half of the anime up until when Hazuki gets carried away to fairlyland is pretty good. I concede that after that plot and execution get a bit messy but I'm still willing to forgive that. I really like this anime. And one of the reasons I do is because the protagonists are adults not schoolkids. A different take on things. Once in a while.,22443,691,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The Nameko Families is a simple show centered around the daily lives of the family and some problems that one of the family members go through. Each episode is 5 minutes long and each are most often centered around 1 family member. Each episode is ro I liked the way each member was drawn and found them adorable in a way. While the animation I would say is average the way it's drawn reminds me of Usagi Drop but more minimal. The background tune is nice and calm sounding and I like the noises each mushroom uses to communicate. Although you can't tell what they are saying you have to assume from the context. Each character was loveable although I wish that some got more screen time. Overall this anime was good short simple and sweet. I would recommend this for anyone who likes the Slice of Life genre or young children if you happen to be babysitting or have some in your family. This anime was done well but I felt that it was over quickly. This series isn't for everyone however it should be given a chance if you have time.,22449,694,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Subarashīdesu. Wonderful anime with such smooth and nice graphics cool idea in the story that differs from other animes. It's similar to those anime (Detective Conan) when the viewers thinks  When will the characters find out or know the secret?!

Let's just say this: I'm still not sure how I was able to watch 25 episodes of this crap. I thought I'd give it an honest chance but you'd really even be better of watching Yu-Gi-Oh GX. This..

I really myself attached this this anime though I did not fully understand the end I fell in love with both the characters and the animation. The imagery used in this anime captured me both body and mind it was beautiful.,22481,707,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Outstanding animation and art in this one. The use of light and colour is taken quite far and it works wonders for the moods. Sounds are above average animes pretty much what you would expect from a movie. The story lacks focus. It was unclear to me at the start who was the main character and it doesn't delve too deep into the characters throughout. The characters have quite generic personalities and the relateability is a bit lacking. Add in a story that is not really told or shown - its sort of left out there for the viewer to interpret it results in a bit of a confusing mess. The romantic themes come through very well and the movie even manages to be a bit touching but the main story is very difficult to understand. In the end it is a beautifully made unnecessarily confusing romance movie.,22483,708,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The premise of this anime sounded promising and I'm sure if they decided to remake this it would be a pretty good show.  The cover artwork is misleading as it looks very clean and modern especially for being a late 90s anime.  However I dropped this after suffering two episodes and normally I'll give it a good go before walking away.,22489,711,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I was expecting Kare Kano to be yet another silly romantic comedy. I was wrong. It's different from the rest and oh so refreshing.,22497,715,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kare Kano (AKA His and Her Circumstances) is an anime about a group of freshman highschool students during the late 1990s. To say it follows the story of just one character would be inaccurate despite Yukino Miyazawa and Soichiro Arima having the most story and screentime. There is a good amount of romance and more importantly there is a lot of comedy in this anime. Still things happen relationships are formed hostilities take place and people become friends. I'm very worried that I may spoil this anime during this review due to there being significant story progression in the first half of the anime. EDIT: I managed to keep it spoiler free :),22499,716,2019-04-13 21:35:40
His and Her Circumstances (Kare Kano) is about a girl in her freshmen year at high school that is not what she seems to be. She masquerades as the perfect model student but under her disguise she is a totally different person. His and Her Circumstances is the story of how she releases her true self to the world and the things she discovers about herself.,22503,717,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is consistently one of the top rated anime movies so i had to watch it but i have to say that i don't 100% agree.  I mean i will say that it was a very unique idea and story and it was interesting and entertaining but i wouldn't think that it makes top 20 all time (or top 10 according to Anime News Network).,22569,733,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Although a really good anime movie im not sure ive just got mixed emotions because on one side its a pretty good anime moviewith this weird other spirit/alice in wonderland type world  and on the other side its this major must see hyped x 1000 movie which is probably the reason it wasn't as good as i expceted for me it was overhyped by my friends family pretty much everyone to the point where it never really lives up to expectations that and the fact that i had pretty much no idea what it was actually about i was actually expecting a story similar to the book dragonkeeper (which is a 5 star/10/10 awesome book!!!) when i always saw the posters of spirited away with sen and the dragon so when i actually watched it it was just wayyy different from what i expected but other than that it was still really well done but also just not really my kind of movie,22571,734,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is very beautiful in both its art style and its story. I love Miyazaki’s work and this was one of the very first I watched. The storyline feels as though it is a tale of growing up facing your fears and learning how to take care of yourself. We start out with a girl sheltered by her parents slightly who doesn’t want to move. She’s grumpy thinking that no one cares about her own feelings about the move and has some fears about going to a new place. Because of her father’s stupidity (in a sense) they end up at an old abandoned gate in the middle of nowhere and go on in. Turns out this place is a gateway to the spiritual world and the family is swept away into a rather enchanting world where only Chihiro will remember. She is separated from her parents forced to work in a bathhouse and learn what her own strength is.,22573,735,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Spirited Away may very well be the greatest animated film of all times. Not just in anime but in the most general sense. The storytelling is perfection itself the characters developed to the perfect point the animation memorable and an artistic milestone that combines the traditional Japanese style with more modern techniques the soundwork fantastic on every level from the brilliant voice acting to the flowing soundtrack. If you do not love Spirited Away then the part of you which has a sense of wonder isn't working right.,22575,736,2019-04-13 21:35:40
An incredibly charming video one of my favorites. My favorite thing about it is the fact that the main character actually acts like a real person (albeit extremely brave) in the absurd situation. ,22577,737,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh my goodness Spirited away The anime which introduced me to anime and to this day all these years later I am still in dear love with this anime It is hard to put this movie into words for me since I remember being only a young kid watching this so much just because of th entire art style beautiful story and amazing characters I love everything about this anime and still to this day can watch it without worry Studio Chibli being one of my favorite anime companys knowning them making this is outstanding but the only way I feel to tell you what I think about this anime is for you to take the time to go and watch it yourself I do not want to ruin your feeling of your first time but all that is to be said is that is one of the best anime ever out there for me.,22603,744,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm in the Anime Club for my Highschool. Yes we have an Anime Club. We had a lock in a few days ago and we started watching this movie at 2 o'clock in the morning. I was wide awake(usually how I am when watching anime). In the beginning of Spirited Away I was confused and thought this anime movie would be long boring and dragged out. that lasted about 2 minutes. The animation stunned me it was so amazing. I've never seen something quite like this animation-wise. The sounds were very clear and unique. Every character had a name and a place in the story. The story is so freaking good. After watching this movie I realized it was better than any animated movie I've ever watched. It was full of so much emotion and thinking. This movie was made so very well and I will always respect it. The story also keeps you watching it won't simply let you go and get a snack. This movie had my attention one hundred percent. There was so much suspense at times so much laughter and happiness at other times and so much sadness at other times. This movie is full of surprises and great animation. I recommend this to everyone who wants to watch a great movie that will be remembered forever after you watch it.,22607,746,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"The movie that made me who I am today. The very first anime I ever watched. I don't remember when my mom first showed me this movie maybe I was about 3 or 4 but I do remember the soundtrack some epic scenes like when the paper birds were hurting haku and how attached I was to the movie. I can't even keep count on how many times I've seen it and EVERY time it  makes me cry my eyes out. To me this is a gate way to the anime world. It prepares you for action spirits strong emotions and scenes that will make you go what the fu-shut yo mouth! XD This is a type of movie where the scenes are just stuck in your head forever. For example after my first time watching it wasn't until I was 9 when I saw it again and at certain scenes I remember saying:  I've seen this movie before! ",22615,750,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Why is this show so poorly rated? Sure it's not work of art but it's not that bad either. It's the kind of anime where you just sort of shut your brain off a little and enjoy yourself. The main character (for part of the series) is Koichi and he's the  openly perverted MC  that started to become more and more popular. The rest of the cast are at least okay and work off of him rather well. My one complain is for reasons I won't say for spoilers sake the focus of the series changes to a new MC for a good chunck of the series. This new MC in honestly rather annoying and is more your typical  Scared boy  type character although to his credit he does gather enough courage to protect his girlfriend.,22625,755,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Whenever I view a film or series I can usually tell by the end whether I enjoyed it or not based on the feeling it gives me. Being a big fan of the 2012 anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica I was aware upon finishing the original series that a third film was in the works to continue the story and not recap it. And after seeing it I can conclude that the film has caused a huge divide for a reason mainly for its controversial conclusion. ,22635,759,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's what the fandome has prayed for. This story is about homura akemi finding out what happened to madoka after she became a god. The sound track is amazing. The song Clara is basted to homura because the both mean flam and passtion and light. My name is clara so it really afected me. Watch it!!,22639,761,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Mostly this movie was a pretty solid visually spectacular and occasionally confusing experience. However he last 20 minutes or so were completely out of left-field and not only end the movie and entire series on an unnecessary downer but also destroy any sympathy I had for one of my favorite characters. I have to respect their ambition but I just can't believe they thought that was a satisfying ending.,22641,762,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really felt this film did not live up to the series. Suddenly Homaru has ridiculous levels of power like Madoka. They Spent far too long having a scene of Japanese puns about what kind of food the girls were. The 20 minute battle scene between Mami and Homaru literally put me to sleep. It felt like it was trying too hard to be too many genres and thus strayed from them all.,22643,763,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well... it's an nine minute love story and the synopsis covers about seven minutes of the story all but the conclusion; which you can probably guess. It's not much in terms of anything but considering the short length it's forgivable; it ain't easy to come up with gripping narrative or characters that you would die for. The animation is lacking and feels cheap the sound does nothing special... and yeah. It's nine minutes and not that bad a waste of despite the rating.,22683,778,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Loveless was one of the first anime I saw. And it was really unsettling. But it's also probably one of the reasons why so many years after I'm still watching anime as avidly as ever. As I was watching it I remember thinking that it was wrong in so many ways; Ritsuka is only 12 years old and Soubi is a university student without mentioning him always being banged up and abused by his mother and I think it's the only anime I've seen up to now where the protagonist is seeing a shrink - I mean there are some controversial themes. And I also distinctly remember feeling that it was also wrong that I should love it so much. Years have passed since then and it's not so easy to shock me now. But it's still one of my favourite anime.,22777,794,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Cat boys in chains are generally amusing to me and enjoyable the the one in Loveless was rather annoying and very unlikeable to me.,22791,797,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It begins with a lonely boy that lost his brother then he finds his bothers friend but his bother was murdered not by some avaedent but at the end it leaves me hanging there but I love it any way it is a good story but I wish it had more episodes then what it has so I know why his bother was killed and what dose he mean he still a live just not him self it just a so much drama that I love it.,22831,803,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Already one of the most recognized comic and cartoon characters on the globe for 45 years Doraemon finally made his animated debut in the United States in the summer of 2014 in an edited 26-episode dub produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment and licensed by Viz.  The dub comprised episodes of the current (2005-present) Doraemon TV anime which is the third one to be produced (the first one in 1973 flopped miserably and the second which lasted 26 years from 1979-05 became a worldwide hit).  And despite the controversy among many anime fans over the localization process for the English dub - namely the changing of the setting from Japan to the U.S. on-screen edits to change Japanese cultural mainstays to American ones name changes etc. - the dub is still a very enjoyable watch.,22887,814,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Now and Then Here and There is a groundbreaking anime. It makesxtremely good use of the 13 episode format. There was not one momentn this where I thought  we've hit filler town! . Whatever scenes wereeused added to the affecting moments of the series. Surely thesecenes are not meant to be pleasant to watch but they definitely makeou feel. So for just that reason one can see the greatness of Now andhen Here and There. However it does not stop there Akitaro Daichi hasade a masterpiece using all elements that make one: involving storyomplex characters moving music and at times brilliant visuals.,22977,824,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well it starts off pretty good and  everything's all happy and cheerfully then things take a turn toward the worst when someone precious is taken away. They soon overcome this tragedy and Georgie is growing up. Soon the brothers feelings for her start to intensify but Georgie is clueless (given the face she's more of a tomboy but soon outgrown these ways). Soon after one of her brothers leave for England and 1 year later when he is to return Georgie meets the soon to be love of her life. ,23007,837,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have watch ll seasons of Supernatural the original season so when switching over to anime(which I love) I find it hard not to be partial. I love the fact that Jared(Sam) is the voice actor in the anime since he actualy plays the character in the in person TV show. Speaking of voices the voice actor for dean does not and never will live up to the voice of jensen Dean in the in person shhow). Though the animatiion of their faces and expressions is satifying. the story does run very truely along with the originaly series. though I can be very nitpicky about detials. Overal I would recamend watching the original series online somewhere but if you prefer anime this is up to par. ,23023,842,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Have you ever started an Anime and felt completely lost?  I know there are Anime out there that the director and writer purposely leave you in the dark till the bitter end.  But Supernatural seems to make assumptions that you have already seen the live action series for there is ZERO character development in the first few episodes.  If you need a bit more background into the charters and what drives them you either have to be patient or ask a fan of the live action series (lucky for us our anime group has one).,23029,843,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved the actually Supernatural Series.  I thought I would enjoy the animation.  NO!  I could not even finish the first episode.  The drawings were horrid and the story was all over the place.  The only credit it got was the voices.  But then I have to wonder what was the cast thinking?!  Bobby's character looked like he belonged on Family Guy Nothing like the actual character.  So the series starts in the middle/end of season 2 with no explaination of who they are or what is happening.  Sheesh explain things to those who may not have seen the original series!  This was the first anime I have truly and utterly given up on.  I have a few other questionable ones but I will not try to watch this again.,23031,844,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For fans of josei Honey and Clover will prove to be a joy. Not unlike stories like Paradise Kiss and NANA Honey and Clover gives a realistic look into the lives and relationships of young adults. Instead of going on a long and dark route of drama this show takes a more lighthearted approach by taking the building of relationships slow and laying a lot of the shows focus on the development of the individual characters. Comedy was also present plentiful and hilarious (and generally of the non-spastic kind) making the 24 episodes go by smoothly.,23053,850,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i'm not sure how i would rate this anime. i did like it- it was very unique to me. but it didn't tie things together very well- which may have been the point because of this- this anime to me was a very realistic depiction of what adult life love and connection is like.  it is not all happily ever afters and if you try hard enough everything will come together the answers will come in time... it's about just getting in there and getting your hands dirty and trying to figure it out with no guarantees- all of it. life and meaning and love and what to do with all of it.  this anime doesn't give you many answers. it only makes encourages you to keep going because the journey is very important. however it is not always glamorous and tearjerking like in a movie.  sometimes the person you love no matter how long you keep at it and how dedicated you are to them will not ever love you back. and sometimes we don't quietly accept this and move on- we might get drunk and cry in front of them over and over cling to them in the daylight and make a fool of ourselves it's uncool and it's foolish and desperate and awful. sometimes at the end of a long expensive college journey we still have no idea what we want to do and even after taking a soul-searching journey across the country we still come up with no answers.  and sometimes love is so rattling that we'd rather settle than struggle with passion.  life is messy. so is this anime.  i've never watched an anime that leaves so many loose ends and that has so many profound musings about life and adulthood that will suprise you because you always noticed this or that but no one else had ever said it out loud so you brushed it away.  It puts into words very beautiful ones a lot of lifes really awkward and unpoetic feautures and makes them into lyrics.  i really enjoyed the dialouge of the fan subs they made me think deeply about my own life and the people around me trying to draw parallels and asking myself if this or that was what was troubling me so the things I could never put a name to.  ,23063,855,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A great series if you are looking for a complicated love story. Don't be afraid of how young Hagu looks; she is a young adult who is underdeveloped and the characters romantically interested in her are not Lolicons. It's a great mix between wacky comedy and tender romance and will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's also a great coming-of-age story and I know many people can identify with that :) I will warn you the end feels incomplete because it is; you have to watch the sequel to get the whole story and to feel satisfied. ,23067,857,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Best anime of this season if not the whole 2013 year. Absolutely fell in love with the characters ant totally enveloped in the heart wrenching story. The only draw back to this is that I have now finished it and am amost certin there is nothing else now where as good out to replace it. 10 of 10 ,23201,887,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Absolutely loved it! The brilliant story the unexpected ending (which was yet very much in line with the idea of  love beyond reach ) an interesting way of story-telling with flashbacks and flashforwards wonderful musics... This anime brings a fresh breeze to the romance genre for which I have been waiting for a long time now. Definitely a must-see for all the romance lovers out there.,23213,889,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is the first time I watched an anime like this. First I thought that Haruki would be with Touma. But then I noticed the way Ogiso looked at Haruki and so that started. But then I was feeling like Haruki had messed up completly but the point is that it was confusing with the whole story but I really liked it.,23227,891,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really enjoyed watching WA2. This is one of those few anime that I watched repeatedly. I liked how this anime went by from first episode till the last however I am not really satisfied with the sad ending (Kazusa & Haruki apart). I wished that Kazusa stays with Haruki since it was so clear that they are truly madly deeply inlove with each other. Actually the scene at the airport Haruki running over Kazusa in front of Setsuna then kiss gives me the hope. Then suddenly a plane departed as the two of them watch.. I was like WTH. Then there is still Setsuna clinging at Haruki like this girl has no shame at all. She had already seen Haruki and Kazusa kissing and yet she can't give up her love. Damn she is so selfish. It was right of her puting the blame all to herself. Yes I would not argue that Kazusa and Haruki are partially at fault not having said anything about their feelings and Haruki accepting Setsuna but what of it if Setsuna haven't made that move and took advantage of Haruki's kindness this sad ending wouldn't have happened. Haruki and Kazusa are deemed to be a couple in this anime. That moment she held her hand I know they are just meant for each other only if Setsuna haven't come in between only if that girl doesn't force a love triangle. But I'd praise Setsuna for knowing all that for admitting that it is her goddamn fault. I don't hate Setsuna at the beginning coz she is like your typical sweet girl wanting to become friends with those two but how come her character develpment has become worse. That's why I hate her now and I would continue to do so if she doesn't realize that love is not supposed to be selfish. Geez they are your bestfriends you should know when to let go.,23229,892,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've just finished watching White Album 2 and I felt very much like trying to write a review. So here I am and this is my very first review :-),23233,893,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I never thought I'd be writing another review. I created this account as a joke just to piss off my friends by giving Fart On Titan a bad review and ended up liking the site and sticking with it. I love Rock and recently started getting into romance anime so I was very glad I found this series since it had both. At first I loved the characters (especially Touma) and really related with the main character because he loved the guitar even though he sucked at it but eventually he found a spot on my hated characters list. Honestly I'm very picky with almost everything so I haven't seen hundreds of anime like some people so I know I don't count as an Otaku but I have to say this anime has the worst ending I have ever seen in a show! I may listen to a lot of heavy music and like violent anime but I couldn't help but feel digusted with episodes 10-13! I wish the series would have ended after they're performance or something! The music was amazing IMO but I'm not exaggerating when I say every single character disappointed me in the end. The reason I'm writing this review is because I want to give people the warning I never got. Here it is: THIS ANIME HAS AN ENDING SCHOOL DAYS STYLE SO IF YOU LIKE COOKIE CUTTER ROMANCE ANIME LIKE ME STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!!! I'm going to watch Your Lie In April soon and I'm praying it doesn't have a horrible ending like this one.,23237,894,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Vividred Operation although not a masterpiece from any standpoint has more merit to it than many people assume. I've seen it hailed as a Strike Witches or even Puella Magi Madoka Magica clone before and that's about as far as I've seen anyone go to describe it. I personally would prefer to watch Vividred Operation to Madoka and in many ways I think it exceeds Strike Witches as well. Vividred Operation beats out Strike Witches in nearly every way which is not diffiult to do and it doesn't have the pretentious hope vs. despair narrative or the shock value deaths of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Vividred Operation gives a nice blend of moe pandering and interesting plot devices.,23247,896,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Another anime that could have been a classic D.N. Angel has a fantastic story as well as plot but then dies out during the end of the series. The animation wasn't nothing too spectacular but it worked for the time I guess. The sounds wasn't too bad although there might be many out there that will argue. The characters themselves were memorable well in my opinion they were however there could have been more of a back story for most of the cast.,23269,902,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As all of the male descendents of the Niwa family on Daisuke’s fourteenth birthday – after failing to confess his feelings for his crush Risa Harada – he transforms into the Phantom Theif Dark stealing valuable art as the rest have before him. In opposition to the two Satoshi Hiwatari possesses the mirror image of Dark – an angelic looking figure known as Krad (who is ironically the antagonist) who despises Dark and the feeling is definitely mutual. The premise is interesting and it does hold your interest though at times it can get a little overly sappy (of course I have a low tolerance for cheesy sappy romantic stuff in romance anime/manga books movies etc.),23277,905,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,23283,908,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this anime is realy good nice story and characters the mother is realy cool when she reacted to elsie reason for staying at there house (see it i don't want to spoil it) well anyway see it its great,23285,909,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The initial plot was promising not exceptional but promising. But the more the show goes on the more it gets boring.,23289,910,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The World God Only Knows,23305,915,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I finsihed watching all three seasons and this was a really good show. At first i really didint understand what i was watching the character was a gamer who didnt want to face the real world for it was boring for him and dating sims games were his ultimate escape but as the story progressed i wanted to watch more and more of it. The target character were all really sweet and the romantic plot setting was really good. It all really brought in the feels and passion of the characters. I am glad i got recommended to watch this because i wasn't dissappointed. So thanks and i hope who ever did not watch this yet will enjoy it as much as i did or even greater.,23309,916,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Show is still ongoing but so far i wouldn`t say that it`s a bad show. It`s simply to understand and funny at points. It starts off with a guy who only plays those dating sim games but then he has to start getting real girls to love him. It's interesting to see how he used his game techniques on real girls. Recommend to watch but it isn't a really lovely dovey show especially because he changes girls after like very episode.,23311,917,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,23313,918,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Keeping in mind the source material this is a faithful and enjoyable rendition. As an adaptation of a lengthy manga it is hard to stand on your own legs as an anime at the 12 ep mark. Nevertheless I highly recommend this series to anime fans whether they've read the manga or not.,23315,919,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was one anime that I was rather reluctant to watch. Reading the synopsis nothing about it seemed to catch my interest. However many people have been talking about it and I have been recommended it by a number of people so I decided to give it a try because it was a rather short series.,23317,920,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's funny how trends tastes and even perceptions can change over time. Less than a decade ago being called a geek nerd or otaku was considered an insult and while those terms have maintained their derogatory status to a degree (especially in Japan) the steady march of technology has dictated the rise of the  Beta Male  and nowhere is this more apparent than in the entertainment industries.,23319,921,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really like this anime because it never fails me to smile in each episode. Some episodes are not that funny but you will really smile because of KEIMA-SAMA. The story of every girl that keima tries to seduce is so heart-warming or intereting. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH THIS ANIME! specially the boys! you should watch this so you can understand US! teehee ,23321,922,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i never really used to like watching romance/school life shows but this show really got me into it; The characters are lovable and I laughed every episode.

Being someone who has watched all the different seasons muliple times I must say. The mere idea behind this story is great. A guy who spends all his time playing dating simulators has to use his vast knowledge to conquer real girls. The main character himself is awesome to som extend. He doesn't give a damn about anyone else but he excels in everything he misses some serious character development though because these conquest doesn't seem to effect him in any way what so ever (atleast not until later). The animation is my favorite thing in this anime. I am a sucker for those obscure and weird twists in animation style at key moments and for what ever reason they crack me up every time.,23353,932,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When watching this anime you will find a lot of battles full of action and it can get your heart raceing a little bit it can be a little confusing in the beginning but all animes can be like that ( which is why i recommend and use the watch 3 episodes then judge rule) It gets better it just depends on how you see the overall anime it's self. ,23409,948,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Otaku no Video is awesome.  It pretty much tells the story of Gainax in animeted form while having interveiws of various Otaku in between.  The Gainax people are cool the interveiwed... not so much.  The message here is that being obsessed with anime in an unhealthy way is well... unhealthy and will lead to unhappiness.  but if you can apply that love to productivity in your life you can find fulfilment.   The ending is epic.  I think that any person who likes or loves anime will enjoy this! I love the animation style because it reflects the time period of anime I like best and I am partial because I like Gainax a lot.  Really cool interesting video. Watch it! And it's funny. The animated parts are more interesting than the interveiws in my honest opinion. STRIVE TO BECOME THE OTAKING OR GO HOME AND GET A REAL LIFE! lol.,23487,962,2019-04-13 21:35:40

DVDs and BRDs are the lifeblood of the anime industry and there's many a hook that's used to make us part with our hard earned cash. One of these methods is the offer the so-called  unaired episode  which is essentially nothing more than a single episode OVA which can act as an addendum to the main story provide closure to certain plot threads allow for a new perspective on certain characters or simply give the viewer something fun to watch.,23515,965,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you haven't watched this yet when you do you'll burst into tears. This is possibly one of the funniest episodes in the series and should be deserving of a perfect 10 but I have my reasons as to why it didn't. So lets start there...,23517,966,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,23519,967,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this was just a filler episode that they created after the anime but was timed somewhere in the middle.  I gave it a slightly reduced score for story because This really should have been part of the series and i gave the series a good score but as a stand alone peice it was not bad at all.  It was really really funny good to watch if you liked the series.,23523,968,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I think someone confused tension with excitement since there wasn't really a lot of tension just a lot of excitement or enthusiasm. So other than the fact that someone can't read a dictionary and understand what they read it was good. It's a full length episode that fits somewhere in the middle of the show. The episode uses some new ideas to be funny instead of what was often used in the main series. The biggest issue I found was the animation. It's like when you try to use your camera and there is just too much light so you have this bright spot and everything else sort of fades a bit. It's interesting I suppose since the two and a half minute special is darker than the series and this special is lighter than the series. Darker is better. ,23537,969,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I thought it was a good show with a lot of dull episodes thrown inhroughout the show. The ending was great. It had potential but itnded up being just average. The characters were average too. Not toonteresting,23605,983,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A post-apocalyptic/cyberpunk tale where the apocalypse is in the form ofassive flooding due to global warming. Kuniko is a girl struggling to surviveith her people in the real  urban jungle  that Tokyo hasecome.

Overall the plot was full of holes the characters were in need of development and the relationships weren’t well developed if developed at all. In some cases it felt like we knew more about minor characters than main characters. Some of the minor characters actually seemed more developed that the main ones. There were a lot of conflicts and events that seemed related only by the thinnest of strings and way too many issues for the short amount of episodes. There were too many ideas all crushed into 24 episodes so that none of them could fully develop much less actually wrap up. The animation was good for the most part but it was inconsistent. Sometimes it was very bland and lacked detail and other times it was very detailed and exciting. There were too many characters to keep up with in my opinion. I think part of that was due to having so many conflicts and stories going on at once. I mean there were crazy plants that shot their seeds and were taking over everything. There was the whole prison side story thing. There was the problem of Atlas not taking the outsiders in fast enough. There was the whole navy boat thing. There was Karin and Medusa and then Mikuni all that went on with her. You had the carbon market thing and metal age. There was the green haired lady and the screaming child in the room with eyes. On top of that you had these blades and the three people who had them who didn’t even know what the blades meant. The plants heirs and Medusa are enough without all the other things.,23613,987,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Absurdly comedic high school harem is how I would describe this show. It is mostly entertaining but at times too absurd. ,23615,988,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Short review of The K Project. I loved it but the story could have used more detail. The plot was excellent and I loved how it covered so much in so few episodes. It gave me plenty of things to think about and I loved the little plot twists it has in it. I love the way the story formed I loved the concept of the Kings and the Clans- I even found myself wondering what clan I'd want to be in. I just hate the fact that there were clans mentioned that weren't involved in the story. Overall it was a good anime one of my favorites but then again I haven't watched much.,23623,992,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Initially the anime feels sort of like a mystery story.  The central figure's character is developed pretty well but then it changes drastically which can and does leave the viewer feeling a bit lost because it does a couple things.  It plays down the aspects before the change way too much and it doesn't build up or develop the changes enough either.  Anime frequently has the same problems understanding a good story and good story development.  This show sadly is no exception and the cause for most of its negative aspects.  Most of the other clan characters are centered around and developed about violence and or conflict though there are attempts feeble as they maybe to show socialble friendship elements. It is a nice effort however it can feel forced or somehow disconnected from the rest of the story and characters.  One problem there is the main social character is gone from the show before the events of the series start and only appears in flashbacks.  The issue here is all the things he said did and displayed to his friends in the Red clan seem to have vanished the moment he died so all his efforts and friendliness feel totally wasted.  Likewise the way the viewer is frequently lost or left hanging throughout the story is very frustrating.  Though you are sort of rewarded but at the same time there are too many things left either unresolved or unanswered so that viewers never really feel fully in sync with the story.  The most interesting characters are the black dog guy the character they want revenge for by the red clan the prechange main character the guy who left the red clan to join the blue clan and the blue king.  To lesser degrees but also worthy of note are the blue clan's second in command the hearless woman and the red king.  Sad to say but none of the other characters are developed solidly or strong enough to form satisfactory connections to the audience.  The psuedo girl friend of the prechange main is somewhat noteworthy but because too much is left blank about her and she is left basically hanging as the series closes she misses the mark.,23627,993,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay so k Project. . . was pretty good.  I look at the length of anime and often times 12 episodes is not enough to get much done.  However K Project was suprisingly good.  It covered a full story with plenty of twists for a 12 episode series.  The only reason I didnt give this a 10 was because there was a lot of lore that they didnt cover ( 3 whole clans werent included).  However they are making a movie called   the lost kings  so hopefull that will cover everything that was not in the series.  ,23637,996,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So I honestly had no idea what I was getting myself into but after I saw this anime I was SO FLIPPIN HAPPY that I stumbled across it. In these 12 episodes you get so attacked to all the main characters that its fricking amazing. Definitely a Must-Watch for me!,23639,997,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I had high expectations for this anime and began watching this with a feeling that I would enjoy it but sadly this anime fell very short. Although there is great promise for the plot with many characters and potentially a lot of history and lore this anime falls short of giving any kind of decent eleboration. It was because of this that I found it very difficult to really engage with. I imagine that the manga and light novels help flesh out the plot a bit more but honestly I won't be checking to make sure.,23641,998,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The anime is only 12 eps long but even though it's so short it was done pretty good. This anime got me from the first minute and I really enjoyed watching it. In these 12 episodes it has a story developement equal to a 100-something anime with plot twists at the right places illustrated in beatiful visuals and perfect music (I love the opening!). The characters are great too. A few minus points for the story because some kings and their clans weren't introduced at all and then there's this open end which leaves everything else to our imagination... I really hope that they make a second season.,23647,1,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Lets do a bit of a role call:,23651,2,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First of all I wanted to start by saying this is an anime that you want to love from the beginning. It has so much potential with adorable characters a pretty interesting beginning to the plot and fun character development even within the first maybe two to three episodes.,23659,3,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I rally liked the show itself and had a great ploy. One of the few things that I disliked about this anime was that the characters had little to no depth. This also applied to the clans only four of the seven kings were shown. Overall a seven .,23661,4,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the things that I loved most about K was the vivid colors- the colors in this anime are probably the most beautiful colors I've ever seen in any anime which is really what kept me going back- and unique story line However the middle of the anime gets confusing and a bit boring in my opinion which made the anime become drawn out to me.,23665,5,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I will admit part of my dislike of this show was due to the fact it couldn't keep my attention constantly so I missed things and ended up with only half the story. Then again if a story can't keep someones attention then that is a sign it is not the best. There were parts I liked and parts I didn't. When it came to the main character the cat girl and the  black dog  I did pay more attention. I found that to be decent. I watched six episodes till it was 2 A.M. I wanted to find out who Shiro really was and whether he was the murderer. It kept switching to other characters and the red and blue kings which confused me and that is when it lost my attention. There were just too many characters and so the characters ended up 2 dimensional. I couldn't keep up with who was who either. God forbid they change clothes during the anime because I won't recognize them. There was too much going on too fast with too many characters and I just kinda got lost and couldn't keep up. Granted looking at the picture for this anime with so many characters on the front cover should have told me that the amount would be overwhelming. It's too many characters even if you made it 24 episodes. If I really wanted to try to know who was who and why who was doing what I could have kept going back and forth between episodes but that is ridiculous. Overall the characters just were not developed enough and the story was too complex and squished in to too few episodes. I only kept watching to find out if Shiro was the murderer. Actually I just let the episodes play while I paid enough attention to know whether Shiro and the other two were on screen or not by episode ten. ,23673,6,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,23675,7,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime oozed style and elegance.  If you're looking for a visual enticing series this is a good one.  Great character design beautiful scenes and pacing.  The opening scene in the first episode hooks you right away and the music blends seemlessly with the visual atmosphere while not being distracting or overpowering.  Many of the themes had that Yoko Kanno esque feel to them.,23677,8,2019-04-13 21:35:40

K or K Project as known by the majority of people has SO many things good about it. Sure it's only 13 episodes long but it's 13 episodes of pure epicness. You might not understand the story from the beginning but you have to watch the whole thing to understand it. The plot is very well made and the characters are all unique and different. And don't get me started on the graphics either easily the best graphics I've seen on ANY anime I've watched so far. The only complaint I may have about it is the rushed plot. In the manga it seemed more slow and easygoing but the anime was a little too fast paced. But it's still greatness.,23701,12,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hands down one of the most unique animes I've ever seen before. The characters all have a deep backstory (most are told in the manga though) and the powers while usually similar are almost all unique in some way. I would describe this season of K as a murder mystery type of story. It's set in a world very similar to the one we know albiet more advanced and the adition of the Kings and their clansmen adds more excitement to the already deep story. I highly recommend this to any anime fan and for those that love ecchi there's also a cat-girl with an aversion to clothes and a swordswoman with an unusually short skirt,23719,18,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Edits will be done in bold.,23721,19,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well having just finished K i thought that i would write this review while it was still fresh in my mind. It was a great experience but it did have a few flaws that were evident as you continued to watch it.,23723,20,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The newest season of Bakugan Battle Brawlers is very interetsting and entertaining. The anime so far has been nearly flawless. So far this anime has the best start so far and is off to a really good start. If this keeps up then this anime will have a really good ranking. This season already show the main antagonists and the main protagonists. I can't make this review very long because I am basing this review on only 2 episodes and so I am not going to draw any main conclusions on how the plot of this new season of Bakugan Battle Brawlers will work out. BUt i can say this that this anime will do very good because just from the first 2 episodes it had many viewers.,23731,24,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Madhouse Madhouse Madhouse... whatever will I do with you? As usual magnificent animation top notch sound (slightly marred by the voice acting of the young player) a good premise... and that's about it. The story is explained in the name. Billiards Death that's it. Putting your life on the line causes people to act a certain way puts extreme pressure on people and causes them to act differently. This is a very classic theme in film and literature.,23733,25,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death Billiards is a rather unassuming title. It is a short that only has a ½ hour episode going for it with an interesting name but a lacking synopsis. What story could possibly be told in a half an hour that could engage you? Well this hidden gem not only told it well but left me wanting more.,23735,26,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Whew finished this just in time for the new season! Overallt wasn’t really a bad show and it started getting a lot better towards thend. The show really could of done without the ecchi it got really annoyingfter awhile. The one president with the sword in the last 2 episodes…. Holyhit she’s amazing and probably my most favorite character in the series.OPEFULLY she’s in season 2. And season 2 also looks like it’ll be A LOT darker  then this one with what happened at the end.,23775,38,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,23787,42,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Overally after I finished watching Asura Cryin' I was left mostly unsatisfied.  The series didn't really seem to become interesting until like the last couple of episodes and by that point it was already to late to become a good show.  Now that was my intentional impression of the show which of course changed after I went and watched the second season.  Which I found after thinking back on it the first season of Asura Cryin' actually may have done a better job than I had thought.  In that it created a rather nice stage in which to launch the second season from because the first season took care of some more of tedious work like character introduction and background story.  As a whole I found the combination of a supernatural and sci-fi theme to be somewhat interested and I don't know why liking that little phase that was uttered when one of the mecha came out.  The animation was average it did nothing special and I didn't come to find myself liking or hating to look at it.  As for the sound the opening and ending did take some time to get use to and once I did I found myself enjoying them quite a bit.  The characters were likable but none of them really stood out as being all that interesting.  So overall is Asura Cryin' worth watching?  Only if you plan on going and watching the second season afterward because by itself it doesn't do enough for someone to actually sit down and watch through it.,23799,43,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"While watching this series I just kept feeling that there was something... missing that could easily make it better. After finally finishing it what could make it better makes an appearance (probably what made the second season so much more popular than the first) but by then it was too late for this season to be redeemed. ",23815,45,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I am a bit surprised at the low reviews this seems to have gotten I rather enjoyed this series. Watched both season one and two all at once. The story is a bit ecchi heavy but I can hardly hold that against it. A good watch with an interesting story. Not for everyone and not a 10/10 but still worth checking out.,23819,46,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ahh geez... where to start? Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture was THE ANIME to get me hooked. I remember my father video taping a show he wanted to watch on Sci-Fi channel and fell asleep and it picked up a  anime marathon  they had starting with this. The last 15 minutes were cut off but I watched that movie 5 times before finding the means of finishing it haha. That being said by today's standards it's pretty lame but at the time it blew me away. So take into consideration most of my ratings for it are from what it was at the time. Yeah they were good graphics back then possibly an 8 but by todays more along the lines of a 3. I think that's fair :],23855,54,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite sci-fi series and when I found out about Arise I couldn't wait to see it.,23863,57,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Short and sweet. The characters are the same and have the core three personality traits of the originals but they are very two-dimensional. As a stand alone anime it ranks just barely above average. Ghost in the Shell's name was Xeroxed and put on this miniseries and it shows. I might finish it just because of the name but that's the only reason. What they failed to take into account was the struggles that took place in the original series and how it brought so much more meaning. The side characters are poorly designed and bring little to the show leaving just the diluted Motoko to her pedestrian struggles. They should have let a sleeping dog lie.,23865,58,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Seriously this is the best anime i have ever watched and now that i am finished i feel as if a part of me has fallen off and died. this seasone is way better than the first two and the only thing i would critisize was that lala went from being always there to hardly there. but thats ok because it left room for Momo. Oh my god when momo first came into it i didnt particulary like her but by the end of this season i friggen love her and her dream for rito is to hold a harem for him lol.,23899,68,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story: I stared watching this b/c I had saw it was meantion right along side xxxHolic ((which is another anime I really like)) I was looking for new stuff to watch so I gave it it a shot and fell in love with it. The story from what I've seen so far reminds me a lot of the Travle Channle shows Ghost Adventures and Most Haunted. I love how everyone trys to get more involed with each case they do.,23901,69,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wouldn't rate any anime perfect in a review but this one gets very close. It's rare that you can find a shoujo (it's leans toward that genre) anime that manages to focus on all the characters has a good mixture of action and talk- time and manages to insert romantic interest and mystery. If that isn't enough to amuse you listen to Father John''s voice in dub; he's an Australian exorcist with the most adorably funny accent. Even if you're sensitive to horror you can enjoy this one as it's light really (I have an overactive imagination and I was fine) so don't let that put you off it. As for the gore junkies there's not really much here for you but the Bloody Maze and that's one of the last stories so you'll have to wait a bit that was the only episode I would call truly creepy.,23903,70,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Heart-pumping extreme ghost-hunting anime. This anime is rather dark and mysterious. It starts off as three young girls are telling scary stories in the middle of a dark classroom after school one day. But for one of them Mia it turns into a real career opening when a strange young man walks in. After giving them a scare he asks to join them in their next meeting. And then one weird thing happens after another and Mia finds herself working for the young man as his temoprary assistant as a ghost hunter; seeing how it was her fault that his own assistant couldn't help much due to an injury he received while saving Mia from a falling bookcase. During thier first case there are four other specialists brought in to help solve this ghost-haunt. And also during the first case Mai awakens to certian abilities she never knew she had. So she too has a place on this ghost hunting team of experts. ,23911,72,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When I watched this my mind was blown because I really enjoyed the way the characters had a love-hate relationship with each other and that relationship really helps gulp down the scary situations.Several times there was a moment that made you jump then the next minute Mai is brawling someone(or something) that made you carry on watching.,23915,73,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The numbers added up about perfectly this time thats somewhat suprising.  The first thing I have to say is SOMEONE PLEASE FIRE THAT FEMALE LEAD VOICE ACTOR.  Dear lord she rarely ever talks normally.  This is one of those voice actors that tried way the f**k to hard and sounded like a complete idiot while doing so.  Her voice was always shaky even when absolutely nothing was going on.  Maybe its an attempt to add emotion to the anime??????  I have seen completely emotionless moments bring out more emotion then her stipid @$$ voice did.  The thing about her is that she plays some amazing parts in other anime.  It seems like the only roles where she just sounds stupid as hell are the lead roles like in Kaze no Stigma.  I went crazy when she opened her mouth in that anime too.,23917,74,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely love this anime. I have watched it completely threw 4 or 5 times and select episodes too many times to count. I really dont like scary stuff and refuse to watch scary movies but I love this anime. I dont know what about it is so great but something just makes it stand out. No matter your interest I think that everyone will find at least something in this anime they like. And the charaters? They really come out to you. They have real personalities and you can relate to them especially the main character Mai. I dont know another anime that could stand out like this one at least one that is any good.,23931,75,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let me open with this : I anticipated a romance. Contrary to my expectations this was in no way a romance....well maybe a very insignificant 1% and that 1%,23933,76,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So... Ghost Hunt. I started this anime on a nice october afternoon (who cares right?) whilst searching for nice animes to watch in preparation for Haloween. Having seen this under the #horror tag I tought I'd give this one a try.,23943,78,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The mini stories are good and the suspence is thirlling  your in the edge of the seat in most of them. While the stories progresses slowly the characters involment and explanations are precise to the point of been blunt. The main character is what you expect of a dark cool kinda of character secrets lurk behind the shadows . THe main heroine in this storie is a preseant one due to her evolment in her own self worth  while is kinda anoying her yelling shes not useless and for once the boobs were up to a minimum. Its an open ending story so if to know more i guess manga is the next step . I would've enjoyed it more with the romance on the main chara but that is only in onces dreams . I cant deny that this story was worth my time and probably yours if you dont mind open ending stories.,23971,82,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Overall a good anime. Althought the story line seemed to look like it had a repetitive side it was made clear as each case was investigated that there was clearly a lot more to it. I have thoroughly enjoyed this anime.,23973,83,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm normally not into horror movies or anime but I rented this series because of the high ratings. Even though it was spooky at times I'm glad I did! The synopsis is a little off. She didn't join Shibuya Psychic Research because of her abilities. She didn't know she had any abilities at all(hint). I guess you could say she was black mailed into joining lol. Shibuya Psychic Research is a team of indiviaduals led by Kazuya Shibuya that take on cases that involve ghost. Everyone in the group has their own unique abilities and contributions to dealing with ghost. For example some can sense them hear them see them perform exorcisms some are just knowledgable etc. This anime can be very suspenseful at times as it urges me to watch the next episode. I love the cases they take on and trying to figure out why someone wanted revenge after they died and so on. I recommend this anime to all anime watchers except children! Enjoy. (P.S. Check out my list for the best of Anime-Action),23975,84,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A typical paranormal anime. The main story is divided into smaller chapters (liek Bakemonogatari) but they follow a storyline. Highly influenced from western world according to paranormal. The title of this anime says it all.,23979,85,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime was really good! The story was good but could be improved. This seems kinda close to magical girl and romance anime but then has its individuality with the fact that there are so many other bonds that don't rely on romance. The story line: This girl named Samire has a special power and can destroy viruses with just a touch because of the anti-body that she contains inside herself.,24037,97,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The fifth season of the Digimon series installment. The fifth season is ok seems to be rather old school with the animation. But enough of the old style animation the characters are great as usual different and better for the most part. The only character that hasn't changed is Agumon from digimon tamers. The story seems to be better than the last season. The story evolves around teens in high school that end up learning that digimon are accidentally entering the human world and it is up to them to send them back. The sound quality is quite amazing and overall the show happened to entertain me to the fullest. ,24053,103,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Anime Haters usually say that anime is 'teh ghey  and that only teenage girls like it. Their second (and more intelligent) argument is that it's stupid because things happen that make no sense at all. Luckily enough most people who tell me that tend to be comic book fans or fans of doctor who and Star trek which throws the stupid argument out the window.,24071,104,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I started watching this anime my expectations were that it would at least be a good waste of a few hours and that’s it but even these expectations where to high. The story of an alien race attacking humanity that can only be stopped by mecha is standard and can be done well this anime however just feels empty.,24089,109,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Taishou Yakyuu Musume's story starts off  and ends with a sweet innocence for a game that I love very dearly baseball and puts a love story into the mix as well. I didn't find any real dull moments with the story I did how ever find a good sense of comedy which to me really helped out the story. The animation feels a bit dated but it's not as bad as many might probably think. The sound wasn't too bad either hearing the crack of the bat ah what a sweet sound *.* (sorry again my love for baseball). The characters were also unique even though a huge portion of the cast did seem to be variations of characters from other anime. (not naming those anime for various reasons). Overall Taishou Yakyuu Musume gets a nice healthy 8.5 out of 10 and yes mostly because of baseball but also the fact that I have a huge love for women who play baseball. But the other main focus of me giving this anime an 8.5 out of 10 is the fact that our main character's story was done very nicely. I was actually expecting something different but there was a huge sense of uniqueness that was put into Komue-chan. Well that's where I'll stand on this anime if you're a fan of baseball and love girls who play well this anime is a good fit.,24127,114,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"This show takes an interesting look at old Japan but makes it not very interesting tossing in womens rights and baseball.... yeah i dunno. I really enjoyed the character designes though. Very eye pleasing even though it wasn't really anything special. ",24133,115,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This review is done after watching the first 6 episodes. It's about sake/beer and food clear and simple. At about 2 minutes per episode this is not the series that you go to for plot or character development. You do get some snippets of the main character's daily life mainly related to her workplace. Working ladies would especially be able to relate. For foodies you'll appreciate how the dishes are animated they look quite mouth watering. Don't get thrown off by how the main character is animated I think they intentionally made her look comical. I'm a foodie so I love these short episodes that get straight to the point. Fu-pshuuuuu....,24139,117,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It reminds me of the korean drama  Lets eat . I think the opening credits can be apart of the episode so that it doesn't take away from the two minutes. Its ok. It has the slow pace that I enjoy in anime.,24151,118,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay this story is a very unique comedy. The voice actress who played Sawako did a wonderful job. This is a romatic dramedy and a an excellent one at that. The story surrounds this awkward girl named Sawako who has been dubbed Sadako after the girl in the Ring Movies ( Japan version). Unfortunaley unrelated to the movie she wears her hair in the same way has a light toned skin and has a hard time interacting with her classmates since she has never really had a friend in her life. Then she meets the most popular boy in school and he begins to like her and helps her find herself and helps her experience all the things she has missed in her youth Friends Rivals Boys Karaoke Dating and yes at the end Dating. My Favorite characeter besides Sawako is the teacher who reminds me a lot of Stiffler from  American Pie  without all the cusswords. Very well written story. Yes there will be times you want to punch the TV but be patient. *Spoiler Alert* they become a couple in the end. My favorite episode is 11 funniest part is from the party to the beach.,24181,124,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved 99% of this show. I just loved the characters in it. Theyomehow made just ordinary events extremely interesting to me. Lookingt the show I realize that it was really slow paced and nothing muchould happen in an episode. Somehow though it just flew by. I felt like was really rooting for Sawako and I was very happy when somethingood happened to her. The 1% that I did not like was the ending. Theynded it to look like there will be a sequel but there was no realliffhanger. I was wondering if that was really the last episode or not.t just ended without really solving any problem.,24197,125,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I started Kimi ni Todoke after a recommendation from my friend since I’m not usually that keen on romance anime I wasn’t exactly in a rush to watch this. But am I glad that I did!,24199,126,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really loved this story.  It was a beautiful glance at an innocent first love and lasting friendships.  Sawako is a girl who is viewed as scary due to her quite personality and her searious gaze.  She starts to break out of her shell and share her lovely inner self with those around her due to meeting a young man Kazehaya Shota. ,24201,127,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I enjoyed watching Kimi ni Todoke. It was refreshing and interesting. The attention to more than just the main characters was also nice to see. Even though the manga had a bit more to it the anime stayed close. I loved the opening/ending themes as well. ,24259,133,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I Lowed Sawako because I could relate to her. I am an akward person (inside of me xDD on the outside I'm loud always doing things for fun) when dealing with people a lot of the time... mostly when I move to a new town (that happens very often). So I understood Sawako and felt a conection with her (otherwise she would have been painfully boring since she is so quiet).,24261,134,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First off I'm male and that is obviously not the target audience for this show.  Although I do enjoy a good romance (such as Jane Austen's Persuasion) and I think some shoujo comedies are hilarious (Ouran High School anyone?) this show just didn't do it for me.  Sure I guess it's cute.  Well the entire thing is designed to be cute.  Every single line.  In fact Kazehaya the male lead is the most perfect bishounen I've ever seen anywhere.  He's even insecure and nervous in all the perfect ways.  While his character design is not strictly bishounen since he actually looks like a normal guy and not a woman his personality is designed from the ground up to be the most perfect man you will ever meet in your life.  And he's supposed to be a high school freshman?  There's just no way.  There are NO high school freshmen like Kazehaya.  Maybe a couple guys in their early 20s but that's it in the world population.  Seriously Kazehaya always says exactly the right thing all the time.  Does exactly the right thing.  Is exactly the right thing except I think most girls would be extremely frustrated at just how freaking slow he moves.  ,24273,137,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Having never read the manga for this lovely series I watched the first season of  Kimi ni Todoke  on a whim only to find it haunting me as I fell more and more in love with the whole series and watched the 2nd 2011 season as well.It's an incredibly sweet at times impossibly-hilarious and highly enjoyable shoujo-romance anime.,24347,144,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In my opinion this is one of the greatest animes I have seen in a long time. It reminded me of STEINS;GATE  a bit which is another favorite of mine. The story may be a tad hard to follow but it's super interesting! The whole concept and world this anime is set in is totally awesome! Beautiful beatiful animation and the characters all have great personalitites. Some kind of pop up and you probably won't know who they are but overall this is a very straight up badass anime with lots of action and twists and turns. I'm gonna recommend it to a lot of my friends for sure! ,24373,150,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a fairly good anime. It has a good story line to it but I wished that the episodes were longer then one minute. The animation of this anime was good but I thought that in some places it need a little bit more details. The sound of the anime is very good. I has good music that does not drown out the characters voices. I love some of the characters voices and now I want to know who is playing them. The characters of the anime are very good. I love what the brothers are willing to do for thire sister. But I still wish that I could have seen more of this anime more then 5 minutes. But over all this is a good anime to watch.,24443,160,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Moyashimon es un anime que toca un tema poco común (a mi parecer) que es sobre las bacterias. Al principio cuando vi el nombre no me llamó mucho la atención pero ya después de que leí la sinopsis fue que me decidí a verlo. Primero hablaré de la trama en mi opinión esta me ha parecido bastante original y el hecho de mezclar los temas estudiantiles con la comedia ha hecho que esta serie no se me vuelta tan aburrida al momento de verla. Luego están los personajes todos han sido bastante de mi agrado. Cada uno tenía una personalidad diferente que los distinguía de los demás. Algo que que si no me gustó de ellos es que se faltó conocerlos un poco más. No se sabía casi nada ellos sólo que eran estudiantes. Tal vez si la serie hubiera tenido más capítulos tal vez se les hubiera podido introducir un poco más. Después está la ambientación de la cual no me quejo mucho uno de los lugares que sí me hubiera gustado conocer más es el campus de la Universidad especialmente los ambientes los cuales vi que no se apreciaron mucho en toda la serie. Espero que en la siguiente temporada eso si se pueda ver. Por último está la animación y el diseño las cuales me han parecido bastante sencillas y normales pero le doy un punto a favor en esto por el simple hecho de ser un anime educacional.,24451,162,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Unique and interesting are two words that describe this perfect anime.  I wish there were a million episodes because this is an underdog anime that doesn't get the praise it deserves.  Who would have thought about the idea of a boy who can see microbes?  There are cute keychains sold at the Giant Robot store in California of these little bacteria.,24453,163,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is a waste of time! Don't watch,24489,171,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When I first started watching Arakawa Under the Bridge I didn't really find myself liking it all that much.  It didn't seem all that bad but at the same time it just fell to catch my interest and so for a time I stalled on this series.  But then when I got word that a second season was coming out I decided to buckel down and finish it and I've got to say that I was quite surprised in how wrong I was about the series.  While the whole grand plot could be said to be mainly made up of Kou as he lives under the bridge which would mainly be true since that is the basis for the overall plot.  But watching you notice at each episode is broken up into several couple minute segments that will focus on something in particular before moving onto something else.  Though of course you find that every now and then the story revisits those segments to progress those stories along either within the same episode or in some later episode.  The animation as whole is done rather nicely and it of course easily gives off a feel that one would come to expect from Shaft and seems to fit the tone that the series is trying to give off.  The soundtrack was marvelously done with the background music able to easily switch to something new and setting the atmosphere and mood for the next scene.  The opening and ending really become either lover/hate sort of thing.  With either a person liking the opening/ending or hating them to which I found myself liking them quite a bit.  The voice actors all do their job wonderfully especially the male lead and female lead.  The characters who as individuals are rather interesting as a cast create certain problems.  With things never going as far as they could between the cast members making it feel as though things could be so much better and entertaining.  Overall once I got a couple of episode into it I found myself rather enjoying the series and was glad when I decided to pick it up again.,24501,172,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not everybody's gonna like this anime but I love it! The characters made me love this anime much more. If you want to be entertained get to see random story along the way with a bit of character side story here and there and a whole lot of crazy silly comedic entries then this anime is for you.,24527,173,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One word to describe this anime: weird. Yet that is the one thing that makes it so delightfully entertaining. With so much anime/manga being made now-a-days you can expect things to get a bit cliched. However this anime takes you into the world of Nino a girl who thinks she's from Venus and lives under a bridge. Kou is intellegent wealthy a bit egotistic and never indebted to anyone--that is until Nino saves his life. From a first look it seems like another hopeless romance trying to stick out but what a shock! -- there is actually a whole city of weirdos waiting to astound you (some in masks/costumes some with mental problems) e.g. the  mayor  who looks like a frog who just rolled out of a pond oh yeah he also thinks he's a 620 year old kappa. Kou must live under the bridge as Nino's lover since it is the one thing she wants in return for saving his life. What Kou didn't know is that he'd have the  others  to deal with too.,24549,176,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Absurd. That would be a word that best portrays this animé. Others? Odd. Weird. Incomprehensible. That I presume is its charm and the reason why I greatly recommend it to be watched.,24573,177,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,24575,178,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Beautiful anime with deep lessons within most episodes. Some are mostly for comedic value however still very entertaining. If you like gintama and random humor you will like this. mostly a dialogue driven anime. I found the animation to be absolutely beautiful. The colors were out of this world and refreshing. To be honest it has been hard to watch other anime's after watching this one. The instant happy mood it bestows is almost impossible to top.,24577,179,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've seen the first season and the second season that is online so my regards about Grisaia it is a good a anime the action and story line are very well made and you can see so much happening in this anime that you say i want more but the scenes when diffrent things happen are well made.,24591,180,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series will have you looking for diamond dust each winter.  It's magical.  I love it personally because there are several main characters with a variety of personalities.  The storylines are quite emotional and often dramatic.  It has a bit of a soap opera feel to it without being too over the top.  The animation is not the best I have ever seen but the storyline makes up for that.  The music is absolutely beautiful and heartbreaking.  I have watched this series several times.  I watch it in the winter and when I just need to calm down.  It is so soothing.  My Mama knew nothing about anime.  This was the first one she watched and she actually loved it.  Maybe you can watch it with your mother too!,24625,183,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I went into this expecting very boring and drawnout crappy dramabout love and some weird stuff called diamond dust. I expected oneull on story as well. Yet boring crappy and one story isn't what iot at all. I recieved a tale about 6 different females in veryifferent situations that captivated me for all 12 episodes. Diamondust playing a magical part in every story Each story had 2 eps to gethrough their tale and I think if each story went on for any longer theyouldn't have been as good.,24629,185,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Stylish slick and and with the guys from Redline and A Woman Names Fujiko Mine behind the helm you know it is going to be gloriously striking (more on that later).

Although the anime was short and the ending was like a rip off; but overall the anime is really good. It's like a one shot anime short series. Supposely the anime was going to continue but it never did. Most animes they ALWAYS say  to be continued  don't believe in it because it won't happen. Anyways this anime is really wonderful the main character isn't like those upsy guys that brags about how cool they are or whatnot. But overall this anime is like awesome yeah I kind of said this over three times now in my paragraph. That's how much I love this anime ^O^ LOL. I watch this anime 2 years ago well i started 2 years ago no it doesn't take me to 2 years to finish an anime. Its called  re-watching . (: But lately this anime keep on getting removed or licence so it may look like a new anime; but its really not.,24683,198,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty neat concept pretty bad anime in reality. Music/sound is nothing memorable characters are nice and intriguing. Story gets confusing and doesn't acutally end. Has some sweet background stuff and kinda messes around with myth's in a fun way. taking that all into account this isn't a great anime actually you probably shouldn't watch it.,24687,199,2019-04-13 21:35:40
definitely an excellent anime. i'm really hoping that there might be more to come. afterall it really does seem like there should be a season 2,24695,200,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I found that overall this anime was not bad to watch but there is no ending.... The last episode is a flash back to explain something that happened like 6 episodes earlier.  I find that that was the most disapointing aspect of this anime. The plot was uncomplicated and simple but that also made it easy to follow and easy to get drawn in at the same time... The low rating I gave was from the fact that it didn't conclude like a series should even if they were planning on a second season and it didn't happen there should have been some feeling of conclusion and yet a cliff hanger to make the watchers interested in the next season.  This felt more like they stopped airing the show mid-season.,24699,201,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a good anime. I like that it has one main story line to it instead of branching off into side stories. The animation of this anime is very good. I like the songs in this anime because they are really good and they don't drwon out the voices of the characters. I love most of the characters in the anime because they are really awesome people. Alos some of the voices of he characters are really good. So over all this is a good anime if you like animes that are set in the past.,24701,202,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This summer special further explores the flashback backstory from the main series. The events are set during the middle of episode 8 so if one wants to watch thhis alongside I'd suggest watching this after episode 8. This follows the day to day life and comedic escapades of Kanna and her guardians Uruha and Ryuya during their journey to find Kanna's mother. And of course this is set during summer. Watch this if you enjoyed/are enjoying the main Air anime series.,24719,206,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie is a revamped summary of the first part of the anime. The  revamping  of the animation was really not that spectacular but it was nice as a die hard fan of the original to see the story get a bit of an upgrade. It definately doesn't reinvent the wheel here if you've seen the original anime series than this is just the first arc with new animation. If you haven't than you may very well be upset and confused as the pacing is way too fast and the movie doesn't take the time to explore certain story elements that the anime did. The characters are not at all developed in this movie with the exception of Guts and Griffith. Even Caska is left out of the lime light here. I enjoyed watching this movie simply because I LOVED the anime. I believe these three movies will cover what happened in the anime then set the stage for a sequel to the 1997 version. Which in my opinion would be phenomenal. ,24773,213,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King es la primera parte de una trilogía de películas por parte de Studio 4°C para intentar abarcar todo el “arco dorado” visto ya anteriormente en la serie. Sabiendo de antemano que es un arco ya animado hace que si uno nunca ha tenido una prueba del mundo de Berserk se pregunte ¿Veo solo las películas? o ¿Veo la serie primero y luego procedo a ver las películas? Para auto contestarme debo decir que es de suma importancia ver la serie primero. Esto debido a que la película tiene que adaptar casi 9 horas 30 en 4 horas 30 minutos esto quiere decir que muchas cosas van a ser simplificadas o desaparecidas del todo cosas que si bien no afectaran el curso de la historia si le restaran profundidad a la trama algo en lo que Berserk se apoya mucho básicamente con esta entregas de películas Berserk baja de un Seinen a un Shonen. Ahora bien si de antemano han visto la serie esta película viene a ser un gusto para las pupilas no solo por el obviamente salto gráfico si no en el nivel de inmersión que ofrece.

Nodame Cantabile has always had a special place in my heart.  I am a musician too and so I have always felt a special connection to this series.  As such maybe I am slightly biased-but I will try my best to be fair!  I will go through my review in each of the four categories: story animation sound and characters.,24791,219,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series was such a disappointment. Let me tell you now it's not worth your time. First off they can't even sing. Second off there is no character development. They have no specific personalities. Theres actually an owl in the series and he has the most character. And story? Ha. There isnt one. This series is so dry for content that it hurt. They jumped from one random thing to another and it just wasn't slightly enjoyable. Not to mention how painfully average the animation is that it just makes this the most boring series I have ever possibly watched. Idk somebody might enjoy it. Im not even going to touch the second season I had to force myself to finish this one. ,24807,224,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I actually like this anime. I have been watching too many animes from 90's since my chilhood so I'm quite flexible in terms of anime(graphics & genre). I love good graphics but I also check if the story was good even if the graphics are so-so that's why I don't just drop anime without giving it a chance.,24809,225,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really enjoyed this Anime. Now I havent read the novel related to this Anime I felt as if I was attached to it after the first episode the bieginning with the Mystery totally pulled me into the Story. It was spooky Mysterys and yet at the same time had me somewhat on the edge of my seat.The story utilized the characters potential and used them to bring a more spooky yet calm feeling to it and then throw you a curve ball it made you think about who it may be at the end like a true mystery it made you guess and investigate yourself.,24839,233,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really enjoyed this anime. At times I found myself so afraid I had to turn down the volume and turn on a light in order to keep watching. It is not your typical  horror  anime but more so one that just creeps you out and keeps you guessing at each twist and turn of the story. ,24843,234,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a creepy horror ghost story what I got was something much more confusing and strange. This anime was a pleasant surprise but I wouldn't really call it a horror. The story itself however was quite unique and I think perhaps that's what made it so enjoyable. I have to admit there were various points in this anime that I questioned what the hell was going on and it really had me working up various theories as to what was happening. Another is confusing enthralling and unpredictable.its probably one of the better mysteries I have seen. ,24873,245,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I wanted to watch this show mainly to see the death scenes. I pretty much went into the show blind. The show's soundtrack is haunting and beautiful the same time. The backgrounds are also very good and pretty to look at. The mystery around the show kept me on edge and guessing on what would happen next. The characters I felt like where a mystery that were not solved. I wanted to know more about the secondary characters no matter how insignificant they may have been. This is an anime where you should pay attention to even the smallest detail. Watching it for a second time around I saw things I did not see before. ,24987,269,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was my first non-mainstream anime. I was hooked on it by the first few minutes. The story is amazing from the start. Every detail was perfect and it had that skin crawling feel to it. From the first episode to the last had a detective show feel to it mixed with the pit in stomach feeling of horror. There were a few characters that I thought were pointless but other than that it is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to those who like a horror/detective story.,25011,275,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a very beautiful anime. i will tell you that. it has a horror and at everystep someone will die in many ways. and it is the people that you never know why it just hapend. overall this anime is worth the while. the voices are pretty good and the story just keeps you at the edge of your seat.,25029,279,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a pretty good horror thriller anime. In terms of sound I loved the theme song and the background music. Story wise I didnt like the ending so much or the direction it took towards the last few episodes but other than that it was still pretty good. ,25035,281,2019-04-13 21:35:40
At first I didn't really quite understand what was going on in the anime nor could I really tell why things were happening etc. It did confused  me the first time around but watching it a second time did make much more sense. But I did like the horror in this anime and the random deaths that occurred which took me by surprise. A nice anime to watch and the animation is beautiful. ,25045,282,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Another anime is quite complicated at the beginning of every episode and get another tajemice by what makes you want to watch the next episode. The series tells the story of the mystery of unusual deaths in a third grade . The main protagonist and his friends trying to solve this riddle and protect against premature class descent to the underworld . Anime outright przewspaniałe the night session .,25059,288,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ok This is my first review so if I mess up please correct me.  Another  was a awesome anime. At first it made me question it a little but then as you go along it gets better. It is a anime that you think you know what will happen but no! It completely shocked me! It is a anime I would recommend to others. It is more a Thriller and Psychological anime more than anything else.  Another  will make you question often. You think you will be able to guess the outcome but it takes a different route than what I thought. This is a anime/ manga I would definitely recommend. :),25061,289,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Another is an anime faithfully based on a novel written by Yukito Ayatsuji.

Oh man where to begin with this one.  Ok the story.  For the first half as others have said this anime was pretty bad.  Well only the first few episodes were genuinely horrible what with the ecchi and mahou shoujo elements.  But once you got used to the mahou shoujo and they let up a bit on the ecchi things settled into a tolerably watchable comedy.  Then things start to get a little trippy what with some people dying and the conspiracy theories heating up along with a few WTFBOOM explosions.  Then Mai-HiME plunges headlong into deep melodramatic tragedy which is actually pretty good.  It's melodrama sure but it's still fun.  Don't expect too many normal people among the cast since there's only about four sane emotionally well-adjusted characters in the humongous gathering of like 20 girls and their assorted crushes.  But it's still kind of interesting to watch everybody else go nuts from the pressure of certain spoiler-tastic circumstances.  The show starts writing itself into a corner and I was seriously interested in how they'd end this thing.  And it turns out they end it in about the second-to-worst way they could.  It's ridiculous.  It invalidates the last ten episodes or so.  It made me roar with laughter along with shouts of  Is this seriously happening?!   Just make up your own ending instead of watching this one.  But who knows you might even like it it's just that this type of ending has never cut it with me.  ,25089,302,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The way I discovered this anime was that I was watching a guy's  Top 10 Worst Anime .  Watamote was #10  on his list and said that there was some redeeming factors that keep it watchable to his perspective.  He described it as a bit too awkward for his taste and that's the type of comedy I like.,25139,312,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story; [8/10],25143,313,2019-04-13 21:35:40
~ Watamote~ is (too put it plainly) just there to make you laugh at a social misfit. now im not saying thats a bad thing but thats the entire premice of the show and its pretty much all that happens. the main charicter Tomoki is a typical outaku nerd girl with almost no social grace or status and a very warped perception of reality. the show follows her and her bizzare antics to try and become what she sees as popular (which to the rest of the world would be  normal ). so if your not into that kind of thing then dont watch it cause thats all there is with only a couple redeeming caveats. the first of which being the main charicter herself the show manages to strike just the right balance of dumb enough you just have to laugh at her and relatable and cute/innocent enough to keep you interested in her long enough to care. the second redeeming factor in this show is its OUTSTANDING music. seriously tha was pretty much the main hook for me in this show. even the openingwhich could have just been another cop-out generic J-Pop song that were all used too takes what the show is and just runs with it into left field. so overall its a very  niche  anime but if u find that  niche  appealing then you'll love it.,25149,314,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Its one of my favoite animes becuase of how simple it is and how relateable the characters are many people have felt like the main characters and fell things are boring and repetitive things are. The anime is 99% similar to the manga only thing is the order of wventw are diffrent. id reccomend this for when u have nothing good on its a good filler. it has a real nick animation style it fells like corpse parties animation,25157,315,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Anyone who has ever suffered from or known someone who has suffered from social anxiety disorder will struggle to watch this show.  So perfectly have they caputred the pathos that the presentation of the main characters struggles as comic have sparked controversy.  However you may feel about that WataMote is both genuinely funny and deeply heartbreaking.  The kind of show everyone should watch even if it isn't exactly appropriate to call it  enjoyable.

Overall this anime is pretty original. It looks like a typical screwball comedy but after the jokes the main character Tomoko has actual character development. I kept expecting some cliche sort of bully to put her down but that never happened. She has an ongoing hatred for the talkative group in her class but they never actually bother her. In the end she is her own worst enemy.,25193,321,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of the most humorous anime I've seen in a while. Whether it be from laughing at the awkward moments or... Oh yeah all the funny parts were at awkward moments. The concept of this anime was one of the greatest I've seen. The opening was also really nice(I have a weak spot for anime with good openings). All-in-all not many anime or anything in general I find funny. So it says a lot if I thought this was hilarious. You can't help but feel bad for all the troubles she goes through in this though. Definently something you should watch.,25241,322,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have been having a hard time finding anime's that interest me recently i would start one then stop because i am not interested. This anime however made me stick to it till the end all of the awkward moment allways tend to crack a smile on my face. Music is also nice i tend to listen to a lot of music from anime and this is a metal type of music genre. I give this anime a 8.5/10 overall. I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a good anime as my friend did the same!,25253,323,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've see better and Ive seen worst anime's. It not that this was a bad anime it's just that there was not much happening through out the 12 episodes. The story line along with the message of the anime were very clear. However the anime lacked the abilitly to remain consistantly interesting as the episodes continued.,25283,329,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I re-watched today after it being a couple of year. I can agree with some of these reviews in some ways. I haven’t watched any other “zombie animes” before so I can’t say this isn’t a good one or a bad one. Personally I like it. There was a lot of hentai screenshots of underwear and so on. But in general if you’re looking for a kinda funny with some kinda deep moments along with the killing of zombies this would be it. But in all honestly the general story line is okay if your just looking to buy so time try watching the first episode and see if it bores you or not. It’s hard to get bored when watching about a zombie apocalypse. ,25329,338,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I feel that Highschool of the Dead had a great theme but due to its short length I didn't feel that it was enough to fully develop the characters and a solid story.  The actions scenes I will give an A+ however if you look at the anime I have given 5 stars you will notice that in order for me to fully classify this as a great anime it needs develop all elements of it (e.g: story characters etc.) in the way that they are meant to be developed.  Highschool of the Dead I felt was meant to be a much deeper anime than I felt it actually was.,25341,339,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really liked this anime. It was filled with blood and zombies and I really like those. And echhi ofcourse. :P It isn't really a new topic zombies. But what this makes different from the others is that it's awesome. I don't really know how to say this i cant really right reviews :P (spoiler alert:) I like how just one zombie comes to the school gate and then everyone turns into a zombie from that one zombie. The best parts are the bathtub part and the shoot-from-boob part. Nonetheless a great anime I would like to see again. Can't wait for season 2!,25345,340,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you are a real zombie fan and looking into seeing an anime that is all about zombies gore and survival...Look elsewhere. This anime is not about the zombies. It seems the artist was so concentrated on making this as close to a hentai as possible without classifying it as such. Every five seconds (no joke I'm being literal) there is some kind of ecchi scene. It is really annoying frustrating and ruins the hell out of the anime.Not to mention that there are some scenes in which are unrealistic to fighting but that's not too uncommon in anime's so I won't rate it for that...It's just all the damned ecchi. So if you're looking for zombies not ecchi then yeah this is not the anime for you.,25389,346,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Everything about Highschool of the Dead is great... but... the fan service is... ugh... It's a great anime if you don't mind frequent panty shots and unnecessary bouncing. It has great characters. my favorite is Koichi Shido. Shizuka is my least favorite. oh well enough of that. If this anime had less fan service it would be great. but you should still check it out. ---Update: The reason I rated it so low is because of all the panty shots and what-not.,25393,347,2019-04-13 21:35:40

How I got in to this was the Manager at FYE at the mall near me and we telling me about the show and more or less about Ep. 6 and for you haven't seen go watch it. In some ways i agree with him that seems pointless but in away not but overall a great show and I can't wait to see more.,25429,349,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of the best series i have ever seen. I love zombies and everthing else was great too. The only issues were that the characters made much progress from being simple students to zombie killers all but the nurse. The nurse's only influence was to help the students out of the school and a few other things including some fan service but did the most progress in reinforcing the  dumb-blonde  stereotype she bumbles and bumps into everyone throughout the series. The story also left something in the way of explaination as  Why are there zombie?  and  What is happening to the characters family? .  I give this series two thumbs up and i am waiting to see if more come out.,25439,352,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The series started out interesting and remained interesting enough for me to marathon the 12 short episodes.  The story itself intrigued me.  The zombie apocalypse?  Awesome!  I also personally love apocalyptic/survival animes so it was a no brainer that I was definitely going to watch this one.,25461,355,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I completely fell in love with this anime from the start of episode 1... Highschool of the Dead sucessfully combines so many genres some are; action romance comedy adventure thriller horror ecchi sienen drama harem and probably more that I forgot. mainly if you like action/ romance anime definitely give this one a go because you will be begging for a season 2 just like I am!,25495,358,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Warning: Spoiler Alert,25503,359,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I started to watch this anime purely for the zombies. I had never seen ecchi before so I didn't know what to expect. Had I known I would have given this a miss. The fan service was completley over the top (I thought - I don't know if it is normally like that.),25517,360,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kolejny nudnawy Horror. Czy aby napewno? Otóż nie Highschool of the Dead wyróżnia się chyba wszystkim od innych horrorów. Jest to pierwsze Anime w którym są Zombie (jeżeli jest inne to przepraszam ale nie znam jeszcze) Akcja HOTD zaczyna się (jak sam tytół wskazuje) w Liceum już w pierwszym odcinku mamy okazje zobaczyć Zombie i lejącą się krew. Jednak jest jedna gałązka która wystaje od reszty drzewa. ECCHI... Tak jest  Highschool of the Dead  jest to Ecchi Horror w którym Ecchi jest dosłownie Tyle samo Zombiaków. W tym tytule nie ma odcinka bez Majteczek na ekranie. No i teraz nie wiaomo czy to dobrze czy też źle. Jedni mówią (np. Ja) że to naprawde dobry pomysł i nawet nadmiar tego wszystkiego nie przeszkadza a nie kiedy u fanów  Pantsu  wywoła chwilowy uśmiech na twarzy. Zaś inni mówią że w tym tytule Ecchi jest zdecydowanie za dużo i to psuje klimat tego Anime. Jeżeli mam być szczery to ja akurat nie wyobrażam sobie tego Anime z Cenzurą  podam przykład z pierwszego bądź drugiego odcinka gdy jedna z głownych bohaterek siedzi oparta o murek kolana ma przy klatce piersiowej. Nie wyobrażam sobie by w tego typu scenach miałby być w TYM miejscu cień czy np. Logo Tego Tytułu. No Ale nie urodził się jeszcze taki co by wszystkim dogodził. Moim zdaniem To Anime naprawde zasługuje na wysoką ocene bo: Historia może zbyt ciekawa nie jest ale ujdzie w praniu Kreska zaś jest naprawde dobra tak samo jak dźwięk Postaci no przyznam że niektóre mogłyby być lepsze ale nie jest źle. Dlatego odemnie ocena 9 (plemniczek xD),25537,363,2019-04-13 21:35:40
With the end of what I hope is only the first season of High School of the Dead I'll review what probably should be one of the most popular animes of 2010. Theres no denying that Zombies are in right now in Japan and with the always impressive Madhouse at the helm they churn out a show thats strangely brilliant combining a typical anime slice of life/romantic comedy with a western style zombie flick/story. With High School of the Dead being one of the only animes to involve classic zombies you the reader can only imagine the hype surrounding the anime that seems to shamelessly hit every demographic in Japan. Zombie apocalypse high school life random panty shots relationship troubles boobies serious drama High School of the Dead seems to have it all.,25541,364,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"As the series is incomplete I will refrain from making any terribly in-depth judgments on its quality for now. But based on what I've seen so far the series has a number of things going in its favor. The main character is one I am fond of and while his backstory hasn't been developed fully yet he transcends the stereotypical protagonist that all the girls seem to be attracted to for no apparent reason. He adheres to his principles and sticks with them through the episodes so far which is one of the things I like about him. As far as the action sequences and the horror element there are plenty of moments where the atmosphere is appropriately tense what one would expect of any zombie movie or show. Art and animation is by no means top-of-the-line but certainly detailed enough to get its message across to the viewer and then some. ",25543,365,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Other then the characters being shallow (which I REALLY dislike) this is an amazing anime. The gore is good based on gore from a zombie movie. I kinda dislike how it is ecchi but oh well. I am expecting this series to be awesome but not to go that far. I will probably be picking up the manga here soon and I might change my review according to later episodes.,25545,366,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh Highschool of the Dead (HOTD) why do you tease my visuals with so much wonder only to fail the delivery of content?,25567,369,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There isn't much to say about this anime it's an anime about zombies. The story line was predictable. The fanservice in this just blows your freaking mind I'm a girl but when i see fan service I think 'huh thats great animation for a boob jiggle'. I loved the dub because it was pure mindless fun and it's just I laughed my ass off every single moment. It's a good start anime for guys and evenfor girls if you turn off your mind it's just fun. Music is great but yea again no development storyline or just plot in general,25589,370,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Highschool of the Dead is a Romance Action anime with lots of blood gore and a decent bit of fanservice. The only problem I had with it was the fact that it was only 12 episodes and I finished the whole season in 6 hours.,25591,371,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At first I went in with a  same 'ol zombie show  attitude. I was pleasantly surprised just after the first episode. The dynamics of the characters and how humanly they are portrayed is amazing. You don't have the feeling that each character represents some sort of stigma. The way they speak and think is very natural. You don't have that  here we go again  feeling. I was also very impressed by how it was  filmed . The different camera angles and panning effects really add to the action of the show.,25599,373,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I frist watched this show I was in love. I never had seen such violence and boobs plasterd in animation. I consider this show the first anime I watched knowing it was an anime. I really want to take the story seriously but it is hard to do so when there is panty shot after panty shot. The characters are fine nothing really stands out too much about them. In fact they could be considered your average anime characters in a zombie apocolypse. There really should be more zombies in anime with serious storylines and characters. I will still watch this show in the future as it does have good backgrounds and a decent soundtrack. ,25619,382,2019-04-13 21:35:40

How do I start with this anime as for its name it may as well just be called Highschool of the Boobs. The anime is practically a hentai I have no idea what the creators were going for but it wasn't a crazy zombie survival anime with badass strategies.,25633,385,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As it stands this is my all time favourite zombie anime... Not that there is much to choose from in terms of the zombie genre in anime but still this is worth the time to watch. I gave Highschool of the dead a 9.7 because hey nothing is perfect.. hrmm maybe Clannad but lets no go there especially when this is kinda on the other end of the spectrum.,25717,397,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't say I really enjoyed this anime. The concept was good and the characters were decently interesting and I did like the little monkey and it was certainly better than listening to the drunken idiots across the street.......It isn't labeled episodic but it felt episodic which is something I tend to dislike. This made the story feel choppy and like there were holes. This is also a 12 episode anime and like many other 12 or 13 episode anime it feels somewhat rushed. ,25915,426,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Going into this show I thought it was going to be much like Samurai Champloo with rap and hip hop during the Edo period of time. I was definitely mistaken by that idea as this seems to be set in a post apocalyptic world where both technology and samurai values are intermixed. This follows a black samurai as he seeks revenge for his father’s murder. Sadly there is a lot of stereotypical depictions of black people as almost all of them have Afros and and the ninja that follows him talks in a rather gangster style.,25943,431,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Afro Samurai is interesting in that it is a bit of a different take on the typical ronin seeking revenge.  The story is about a guy named Afro who just happens to also be a samurai as he goes on a journey to find the guy who killed his father inorder to take the title of Number 1.  Afro being the one who currently holds the title of Number 2 is the only one who is allowed to challenge Number 1 but there are several people who want to tak the Number 2 title away from Afro so that they can challenge Number 1 themselves.  So that's the basic premise of the story and truth be told it works well for the series.  We get some pretty good action and never really become bogged down with boring details.  The animation looks really good and creates an atmosphere that really works for the series.  Having a rather dark vivid color pallete the does wonders for the show.  The sound gets high marks because of one very simple reason and that is the fact that Sameul L. Jackson does the voice over for the main character and include a good soundtrack and there's not much to complain about.  As for the characters they tend to be a bit flat and uninteresting.  There's Afro who doesn't say much instead leaving that to his inner self that voices all the thoughts that Afro his having without him actually expressing himself.  Which is a major problem Afro never seems to change and instead always has that same stern look.  As for the other characters none of them have any real depth to them and the only purpose they really serve is to end up as bloody stains on Afro's sword.  Overall the series is still pretty entertaining and will fill anyone in need for a fix of violence.,25967,434,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Afro Samurai is in my opinion wasted potential. That may seem unfairly harsh as an opening statement but watching a show that had the potential to be great get ripped to shreds in the face of cliché bordering on generic action-hero dialogue from everyone but the show’s saving grace Ninja Ninja was painful. There is very little character development and what there is seems incredibly forced as if the characters are only grudgingly growing as people and even then exerting the least energy possible—it would actually be ten times more interesting as an anime if it were actively acknowledging how two-dimensional all the characters were but I digress. The show takes place in Japan sometime in the past but with clearly anachronistic technology which would have been really interesting—had they given any time to explain it at all. They seemed to be trying to keep it purposely ambiguous but with the lack of any sort of info about the setting exposition based or otherwise it made it difficult to get into the story. The animation overall was awesome but became very difficult to follow during scenes of heavy action. Sound fell into a similar problem—the music and voice acting was lovely but seemed to fall apart during heavier scenes sabotaging basically any chance of becoming attached to any character or the story. Sadly I can say with fair certainty that I would not recommend this anime to anyone I know unless they were looking for something to be disappointed by.,25971,436,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Afro Samurai offers lots of fast paced action but if you're looking for an anime with a really in depth story this isn't for you. Afro Samurai is a straightforward revenge story. Most characters are very simple from wanting revenge or power. Even so since it is short it is worth while watching.,25975,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of the best animes for getting new people into anime. It's overly stylized visual aspect tends to capture the attention of people normally pushed away from anime the Samul l Jackson english dub also gives newbies a familiar voice to grab onto and feel more comfortable and finally the western influenced music (mostly rap i think da rizza or however you spell that did the soundtrack) connects everything while maintaining solid background noise.,25981,441,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As you will be able to tell from the scores I loved this . It was the first anime I watched and it has got me hooked.

With all their cyborg ninjas hip hop style and hot women . This is a must watch . Get on it now,25991,445,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Now Afro Samurai was on my to watch list not really because I actually wanted to watch it but for the fact that it was pretty popular in United States when it came out. It was to be one of those titles that I had to watch just to say that I actually watched it; and I really had no intention of watching it anytime soon. ",26007,447,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well let me put it this way. You have to be engaged within the story to like it. It really depends on how you look at it. The animation is rather nice and the beginning and middle are brilliantly developed and give the story an edge but then as we reach the ending things start to slip. Where it is revealed that Afro killed his master for having the #2 headband which he must obtain to get the #1 headband (I know I know dumb rule but that's how it is). Why is Afro aiming to get the #1 headband? To avenge his father's death at the hands of the #1. Everyone is planning on attacking Afro to get to kill the #1 but Afro is too strong. Then later in the story he comes across a former friend who was a fellow student of the master Afro killed for having the #2 headband (seriously if he wanted to hide it why didn't he just give the headband to Afro and fake his death would've worked out a lot better for both of them). So his friend tries to kill Afro in hopes of getting revenge (which is rather hypocritical because he hated Afro for choosing revenge over forgiveness). DUDE THE GUY CUT HIS DAD'S HEAD OFF!. So it also ends in a stalemate with the outcome ambiguous (not cool).,26009,448,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Afro Samurai the story of a boy who fights for the honor of his father. As a young boy Afro watches his father get killed by the holder of the number 2 head band. Infact the man was his fathers friend. Afo swears vengance and the story follows Afro on his strugle to obtain the Number 2 head band.,26017,452,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Afro Samurai is made up of 30% action 33% style 30% badass and 7% everything else. It's main purpose is to show how awesome Afro is and nothing more than that. Straight up this is a tale of revenge; Justice kills Afro's father and Afro goes for revenge. That right there is the story. There are flashbacks to Afro as a child to give him more depth but that's pretty much it. Unfortunately Justice doesn't appear much but it is mostly about Afro journey to get revenge so that probably explains it. It's also a mix of modern technology and samurai-era weaponry which works quite well. The battles are the bread and butter of the series and is what you should be watching this for. Violent and pours out style just like a slash wound. Fights where Afro is against a group of foes are basically curb-stomp battles but are fun to watch and the best ones are 1 vs. 1 particularly some of the ones later on.,26019,453,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is the first and only gundam I have ever liked. I have seen tons of the others and this one is the only one that made me understand why people enjoy it. I loved the characters the conflict in the story the resolution of the conflict and everything in between. The charcters are diverse and realistic in the sense that none of them come off as perfect. They make mistakes and learn from them. They grow. The story is never boring and moves along at a good pace. no jumping and skipping everything is explained so there is no confusion. the art was good not great but good the sound was good again not the highlight but good. All in all a definite must see.,26031,455,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Errrmergherd! Season 3 is finally here :). I absolutely loved the first two seasons due to its action-packed scenes with almost super power-like moves (the Aomine - Kagami battle was intense!) humor beautiful animation good character development (Aomine is best) and strong sound support. I've only watched the first episode now but I'm hyped! I like how they introduced a new character in quite a natural realistic feeling way.,26089,468,2019-04-13 21:35:40
How bloody long have I waited for this amazing anime to emerge again and season 3 is even more intense it has excelled it awesomeness and I am just indulging this anime so much right now.This anime is indispensable for any anime list and must watch for any sporty anime lovers.Everything about this anime is just stunning ^^,26091,469,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,26093,470,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I feel with a traditional martial arts story in relation to anime I feel it could go in certain specific ways and I felt it was a damned if you do damned if you don’t situation with what your typical martial arts movie or series could be. Allow me to explain in the games Akira is portrayed more as a serious old school style martial artist and tends to really have no sense of humor. While in the anime his behavior is juvenile sarcastic and has an appetite like Gokuu from Dragon Ball. Despite that he still has a deep respect for the martial arts and is always willing to defend the weak. So I guess in some ways this is a good thing just to prevent Akira from having a one-dimensional and too cliché personality for the time. Pai is also portrayed as child like but has some skill of her own. I enjoyed the portrayal of the other characters since most of their personalities are more faithful to that of how the game portrays them and are expanded in this anime and each character has their own unique use and development.ut unfortunately the series does tend to move a bit slow and tends to rely on sci-fi mechanisms at times which isn’t really what I like in traditional martial arts media at times. Even though there are some accurate portrayals from the games there are some ret-cons such as Dural who is really Kage’s mother. While in the anime Dural is a robot soldier project from the Kouen-kan. And even though Lau serves as the primary antagonist we also have the use of Eva Durax who is the company’s chief scientist who is hungry with power and to destroy her enemies. So you’re getting something more original in story but for the most part in characters tend to be faithful which both have their pros and cons.ell the art and resolution is very flat and I feel that the character designs are childish. Despite my criticisms of calling it childish I still can see how on the other hand the designs can possibly symbolize the more campy nature this anime may have intended to have. But in most cases the costumes hairstyles and the fighting styles of the characters are dead on perfect. The fights are ok. You know how some people have criticized the fights in Record of Lodoss War of mostly having still shot like paintings for the fights? Well personally I have to say that this anime also serves that exact same problem showing the budget of this show. But they are dramatic and still have good angles and colors.ut what really makes this anime stand out is when they do show the fights in motion and whenever a character does a trademark move or to introduce some kind of fighting style like Jeffery’s pankration the anime will re-cap to that move and explain how the move works and what its purpose is which I found entertaining. Also what I also can’t stand is the recycle footage of Akira preaching that martial arts shouldn’t be used for evil blah blah blah. It gets older than Jesus after the first episode and it gets somewhat annoying after awhile.he Japanese voice cast has some very good names such as Miki Shin’ichiro as Akira who still continues to play the role in the Virtua Fighter games to this day. He does an excellent job of being childish when it comes to food and mature when he has to explain that he can’t stand the unjustness of what he sees sometimes. Pai Chan is played by Gundam veteran Matsui Nanako and Matsumoto Yasunori the voice of Niijima in History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi and Takagi Wataru in Initial D does a great job of being the all out no nonsense Jackie Bryant. The English dub on the other hand I find to be very terrible. Especially when Leon’s voice in the games is not at all represented. Yes Leon does sound cheesy but it’s what defines him and I just felt that lack of presence alone in the English version was what ruined it for me. I know that some people may not like that but as a fan it did upset me.efore giving the final score I have to talk about the music. This was the anime that made me a fan of Vivian Hsu who is Taiwanese but yet is singing Japanese music. Vivian Hsu also sings Moment one of the songs from Gundam SEED and plays the frail girl in the Jackie Chan movie The Accidental Spy. She sings the ending songs to this anime Kuchibiru no Shinwa and Kyouhansha. I just love how multi-talented she is with these songs. With Kuchibiru no Shinwa the song is very innocent and carefree but with Kyouhansha it’s very seductive and much darker and I felt both songs really represented some of the female characters such as Pai and Sarah. The opening theme Hot Wild Vision is also a pretty sweet song itself. It’s very calm and energetic. But I do have to give the English staff credit for making these songs into English. Granted the singing is not the best I have to tip my proverbial hat off for their efforts.ell unfortunately Media Blasters cut this anime series 11 or 12 episodes short and I can’t find the rest. If you do PM THEM TO ME!!! It may not be the best game to anime adaptation but I do like how in some ways it does try to stand on its own. I felt of this anime came out to America in the mid-90s after the series was over I felt it could have had better success with the market at the time and people could have caught on. But the style of fighting and the fact that Virtua Fighter in general isn’t really that popular outside of Japan and Korea would prevent this anime from getting any popularity. Still I don’t think you need any familiarity with the game series to give this a try because it does a great job of explaining things to you though as I said before it does detract from the games to some extent but for all the right reasons and done pretty well. Granted I still don’t think it’s something special or top 10 I felt it did expose me to new things such as Vivian Hsu and it had some concepts which I would say later influence Naruto in explaining stuff to see it paved way for other things for myself in the long run. Then again I could be wrong. But I feel confident on how I overall feel about this anime nothing really outstanding but still descent.,26095,471,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I didn't really like this anime special in my opinion it didn't realte back to the main story of the anime which I was looking for. The story line was okay for a 1 episode anime special. It had some good animation in the characters desings. It had some good music to it. However I didn't like some of the voices of some of the characters. I liked one or two of the main characters but the others I think didn't add that much to the story line.,26097,472,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not really sure what to say about this one. It's like they had some extra money in the budget and made a fanfic episode. Watch it or don't. It has nothing to do with the main story or anything else.,26099,473,2019-04-13 21:35:40

After watching first season and being introduced to the one of the most interesting sf worlds in anime last years I hoped that new episodes will deliver even more. Bringing answers to the lore develop some characters and reveal some secrets. Unfortunetly except first and last two episodes all the series is about daily boring life lot of anime cliche scenes and unnecesary harem background. What's worse instead of mysterious and dangerous chimera alien the new character turns out to be typical cute anime child-type animeal (worm) which destroy dense atmposhere of the series completly.  I also didn't like new opening and ending or maybe it's first season which was so good in it. There are still good parts about this series but overall season 2 looks like one big filler with plot typical to all anime those days and hardly any plot development. However the main story and some characters are still interesting and I would love to see some anserws in the next season which I hope will be done after manga will be completed to avoid any more unnecesary fillers. Except fillers and chimera worm (unfortunely content of main plot) Battle for Planet Nine is still old good Sidonia although it's a shame that only in few of the 12 episodes.,26109,478,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime isn't great. It doesn't have an amazing story or creative characters but it does serve a function. If you look past all the panty shots and breasts. You can notice that it does work has a sleeping aid. Some people listen to music or the ocean but for the anime fan those may not cut it but it does feel good listening to a girl gently sing and hearing the slow gentle breathing as if your partner was next to you. I can't say I love the character or the story but I do love using it as a sleeping aid to let me rest easy at night ,26139,488,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The BEST thing about this series (and in a way about the first installment) is the theme music truly marvelous. It is possible to watch this series without the first which in a way is more recommendable sometimes the plot line diverts into a character driven situational irony and that seems to be kind of annoying as you go along. I can recommend this is you like cardcaptors and sailor moon but with a ninja theme. It was alright but like I said the theme music was the best i've heard ever.,26155,496,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Psycho-Pass Movie is a strange film as it combines aspects of the first and second season with a marriage that is not very solid. I don't know where in the story this takes place and I don't know how certain characters are here when I could have sworn they died but I do need a refresher course in the series as I've totally forgotten much of the second season so perhaps the timeline does make more sense than I perceive.,26229,514,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Personally I try to avoid movies based on pre-existing series. Usually they come off as fanservice and do not further the main series in any way. And when said movie has tied into the main series it is often very rushed and poorly structured mess (I’m looking at you Gundam 00). The Psycho Pass movie is no exception. .,26237,518,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just finished the movie. Quick review just to say that I don't get what they're raving about. I thought the first season was good enough: the concept and setting - if not extremely original - were interesting and the pacing wasn't bad. I'm fascinated by this kind of dystopian stories I find them in most cases thought-provoking. The second season was a let down mainly filler in my opinion with boring new characters. I was hoping this movie would be better as it was bringing back Kougami which in the first season was a decent character. Wrong.,26239,519,2019-04-13 21:35:40

All I can say is WTF is with this story. Its like Clannad mixed with Sailormoon mixed with Fruit Baskets. It goes from a sad story to a miracle...after the first episode which ISNT explained then to repairing a whole village to a magical transforming girl. AND EVERyONE HAS BANGS.....,26247,522,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The best thing about this series was the intrigue. The very first scene pulls you in telling about a man walking on the beach beside God. The story is interesting because it is both slice of life and supernatural at the same time.,26251,524,2019-04-13 21:35:40

H2O - Footprint’s in the Sand is a 12 episode harem ecchi anime with themes of bullying and comedy also claiming to be psychological. Initial impressions looked positive the main character is blind and a girl is getting bullied for some reason it seemed promising. I wanted to enjoy this anime but I soon found it to be rather shoddy with various pressing concerns. Especially the story. The title refers to the names of the three main female characters Hayami Hinata and Otoha. It sounded like the sort of anime I’d like I was expecting it to be quite serious and thought-provoking. Keep reading to find out where this anime went wrong.,26259,528,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm kinda happy that Kohinata is alive yet have that twinge of annoyance that she came back.  The story was great in my opinion but it killed itself at the end when she came back over 15 something years later.  Now my question for future series is:  How about when the main girl dies the guy goes for a new one?  I haven't seen many series that actually focus on the getting over it part.,26261,529,2019-04-13 21:35:40

was a generally good anime with good story beautiful animation and visual effects and great sound track the only thing that would stop me from giving this anime a 5/5 star rating is that the gimmick with all the female characters in regard to the main male character is that it was all the same they all got jealous of small things and got repetitive in the character development.,26295,546,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The only reason it didnt get the full points is because the end is a bit cut off. (There was still one match to play). The characters and the story are awesome except for the last match as in my opinion took to long. (20 episodes).,26297,547,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The best action sport comedy anime ever with great story line and cool animation. Really enjoy it. The story lay to their main character Sena that had brought us to american football world more detailed. This anime more life with another main evilcool character like Youchi.

To me this anime was another Romeo and Juliet story just add ninjas blood and a competition to she who will be the next heir and that about sums this story up. It wasn't one of my top favorites mainly because the plot is very depressing yes the anime its self was good but it could have been better in my opinion i'm not sure what but it is missing something. I do recommend this to anyone who likes the Romeo and Juliet concept and Ninjas. I hope i was to some help!,26319,558,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I cannot really stand this show. I was glued to Aishiteruze Baby and was disappointed and put off by the show's darkness and constant crying by a character so I decided to check out Papa no Iu Koto o Kikinasai it looks more interesting anyway. It's sort of like Aishiteruze Baby and I was expecting something more light-hearted and innocent like Usagi Drop but this is not a children's show. I am very displeased by the thought of a little toddler molesting an older girl what kind of sick toddler is that?

Darker than Black Gaiden is a 4 episode OVA bridging the gap between season 1 and season 2 of this sci-fi action anime series which was unfortunately released after season 2. It’s set before season 2 and will explain a lot of the plot in addition to following the main characters after the events of season 1. It is much like season 1 with a similar vibe to a gritty superhero show and almost combined with a spy movie since there’s a lot of running around various locations. I made the error of watching the second season before having watched this. Which would have made more sense had I done so. This is not set after season 2 thus it doesn’t do anything to repair the slight sequel-bait ending in that season. Funny since season 1 just wrapped things up nicely. I will disclose my hate for harem/ecchi and pointless fan-service as usual.,26441,576,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was the best thing about Darker than Black shame to say considering it was so short. I thought that the first series was rushed it didn't explain itself very well and showed off characters who then never apperead or had further mention but it was still enjoyable good fight scenes and decent animation with hei's personality changes quite interesting.,26443,577,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The second season of Silver Spoon is just as good as the first if not better. It continues and develops the story that in the first series was presented so well. There is now a greater focus on the characters and their development and not only Hachiken as was the case in the first season: now Mikage is a main character as well.,27369,582,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Segunda y última temporada de Gin No Saji aunque para mí ya lo tenían de antemano animado y simplemente decidieron dividirla en 11 capítulos por temporada. En esta nueva temporada nos encontraremos con los mismos personajes de la primera más una integrante nueva pero que si acaso logra aparecer escasamente en 3 capítulos (Supongo el manga aparece más). Ahora bien si en la primera temporada nos enseñaban de que iba en el trabajo de los granjeros esta nueva temporada se enfoca más en la vida de estos nos enseña la otra cara de las granjas sus financiaciones como puede prosperar una granja o como puede caer irremediablemente en la banca rota. También profundizan en la relación de Hachiken y Mikage creando un extraño pero simpáticamente mediano arco de amor entre estos dos también nos presentaran a los padres de Hachiken y enseñándonos un poco más la bastante complicada relación que mantiene con ellos.,27371,583,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overall I liked this anime I found that the animation suited the usually light hearted scenes in the anime. The plot did need work however and I felt as if it was going back and forth with Haru confessing to Shizuku and then her confessing to him but getting rejected. It felt slightly silly and I can't say that at one point I wasn't screaming at them. It did have a ton of good moments though where I felt genuinely sad for the characters or laughed at the crazy stuff that went on in this anime. It was actually a really funny anime. I usually don't watch slice of life anime but this felt so exagerrated that I couldn't help but fall in love with it.,27417,595,2019-04-13 21:35:40
wasnt the best anime ive watched but not the worst either had mixed feelings about this one as it had a good main character romance story with bumps in the road and such but some of the other characters just didnt care for or their little side stories and such.,27419,596,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The thing is this was exactly what I was expecting since we've been knowing each other for a while now (I mean shoujo anime and me).

Have you ever watched an anime that was usually hard to watch at the very few episodes but later on it gets a little better? Well Tonari No Kaibutsu-Kun is what I'm going to explain in the anime right now. I have never watched the OVA yet but the upsetting part was that the manga ended in 2013. I wish they could at least get out of their shell so they can make the 2nd season. The anime is a combination of romantic comedy school life and maybe slice of life altogether.  ,27495,610,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I wanted to kick myself when I first began to watch this but after watching the whole thing I want to kick myself for actually thinking it was good. For its time it had some pretty good philosophies to offer still its a shame that people relied on mediocrity to interpret these meanings. The comic relief in the show helped keep interest the switch of personalities were what actually drew me in I especially liked Kiroberos and Spinner's little rivalry. Anyways being an anime that I never would've guessed would be good I actually recommend it.,27525,618,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was my favorite anime when I was younger; I must've watched every episode like 100x. The anime is about the life of a girl named Sakura she releases Clow Cards with magical powers and is appointed to be the Cardcaptor to reclaim them and be their master. She then has to transform the cards into Sakura Cards. I really love the storyline and the animation and sound are great :) I love the opening and endings for every episode. The characters are slightly cheesy (now that I look back on it) But I literally worshiped this anime when I was in elementary school. I rated this as a 9.5/10 but gave it 5 stars :),27559,622,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Let me first say that I am a sucker for romance animes. This anime made me cry so many times. Especially with the songs they had to go with it. There was a love triangle involved and sometimes I went back and forth of which guy she should end up with. I loved this anime so much that I finished it within a day. I definitely recommend this one.,27629,637,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Bokura ga Ita interested me because I was bored.  I rarely watch these kinds of romance-y animes but recently I've grown fond of them since they tend to be short (20-30 episodes) cute and funny.  However I feel Bokura ga Ita could have been finished out in 12-15 episodes.,27631,638,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As old as Speed Racer is its still a blast to watch. Its fun too see all the ways they tried to preseve the budget by moving the camera around in a panorama style and using stills of Speeds face while we hear the voiceover voice speeds thoughts.  For being so old the show is actually somewhat violent with many fatal car crashes and explosions.,27681,645,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Since 2006 light novel adaptations have gradually become a regular feature in anime as producers in the industry scrabble around in their attempts to find the biggest cash cow since the advent of Suzumiya Haruhi. The surprising thing is that the fallout from this has actually been a lot better for fans than one might expect and while titles like Guin Saga Kemono no Souja Erin Ghost Hunt Baccano! Kure-nai Rental Magica Spice & Wolf and NHK ni Youkoso! may not be as commercially successful as KyoAni's behemoth they do represent a gradual shift in the industry towards creativity and originality.,27787,660,2019-04-13 21:35:40

XXXHolic Kei works as the continuation of the fisrt season. It spreads on 13 episodes instead of 24 like it's predecesor. It develops manga chapters from volume 8 to 13. And again like the first season before it it completely put aside the links with Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. In the paper version both series have important links to each other. It is startling that in the anime version you do not feel at all this important aspect of the original material.,27829,667,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm a real fan of magical girl anime. This show really hit home with me on some parts because it really made you feel what the characters were feeling during turning points and crisises in the story line. Mainly the thing with Fuyuna. I love how at the ending the two of them finally got to talk it out and they both recieved some sort of closure. I feel like the story is incomplete though as per usual with seasonal anime. Hopefully the series gets a season two because I feel like more things should be explained. Like Akari's mom's past and I would like the rest of the tarot users to be introduced into the storyline some how. Anyway over all for it's magical girlness and cute art style and theme I give it a pretty high rating because I enjoyed watching it even though I still have some questions unanswered. It reminds me a lot of Madoka and I really hope there's more to both series.,27843,673,2019-04-13 21:35:40

While Chaos;Head is my favourite anime so far like with Lain I can see why it isn't everyone's cup of tea. It's dark and confusing* and the main character has drawn huge amounts of flak simply for not being like the majority of people. At least with Takumi Nishijo you know that if he's going to get up to something it will be in his own home and he won't be drunk. ,27857,680,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It looks like japan anime industry is for hikkikomori. Stencil character types pseudo-scientific story and lack of logic in character's actions. Yeah it was kinda fun watching this anime but its all.

When I first saw the anime I thought it was not interesting at all. Although as the storyline progressed it became a little more interesting. It may seem like a Harem at the time but I say give it some time if you start it. It could be better but then again it is perfect for its sound story line and Characters. The animation of the fight scenes and in general it is better than some other anime I've seen.,27911,688,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Anyway Chaos head is in no way as bad some people make it out to be its jst a matter of opinion sure i may be baised as well but there is a story maybe no the best but people who gave it one were HARSH seriously whats wrong with some slightly spastic storyline I seen worse trust me.

So this is my review for the winter 2015 anime Shirobako it is a slice of life anime around a group of people in an animation company. It is a very light-hearted anime and is great for a marathon. It follows the story of 5 girls who want to make an anime together like they did when they were in school but it wasn’t as simple as they thought it gives us a view on what the anime industry is really like and I enjoyed that (which is why I gave it such a high grade overall).,28021,711,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ginban Kaleidoscope is an anime that probably has a lot of people wanting an alternative ending. The storyline was different from any other ghost stories that I've seen/read about so far which I consider a positive. I mean I've never seen another anime that involved figure skating and ghosts. The characters and their personalities were moderately detailed and were hilarious -in a good way. The moments of comical relief -with Tazusa threatening to consume tomatoes and her yelling at her friend when she is actually yelling at Pete- caused a reaction involving laughter and tears.,28045,716,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime both 1000% and 2000% have been in my number one slot since forever. I fell in love with it the moment it came out and hadn't wanted to share it with anyone even with my apprentice anime lover that i got really into anime back when we were little X3. She barely found out and watched it this year after i got over my selfishness and recommended it to her.

It's central focus being that though things may come easy to certain people it's important to never give up in accomplishing your own goals.

Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an average anime. I'm not saying it's bad just that it's completely in line with what you would expect from a romantic-comedy set in a high school whose protagonists are teenage kids. It's entertaining and enjoyable if you like this type of anime but it doesn't deviate much from the standard clichès of the genre for what concerns the plot and the characters especially so for the male lead. I wonder why anime creators seem incapable of producing a male lead with some personality. After you've seen a number of anime like this with always the same kind of indecisive wishy-washy boring and clueless male protagonist it gets very frustrating: there's no understandable reason as to why he should be surrounded by multiple girls who inevitably end up falling in love with him. In this case you have this completely normal high school kid who has no idea about what he wants to be when he grows up whose life gets turned upside down when he meets a girl who is a prodigy at painting and with very clear aims for her professional career but is at the same time completely inept at looking after even her most basic everyday-life necessities. So boy meets girl with an additional twist given by the fact that it's mediocre-boy meets genius-girl. This plotline gets repeated and kind of hammered into you because there's two of the secondary characters who are in the exact same situation. And how this is presented and developed makes for a good watch. Apart from the predictable protagonist threesome (boy + two girls vying for his attention) there are at least five other secondary characters (once again anime stereotypes) who are likeable all have a back-story (at times overly-simplified) a definite personality and undergo some development. Apart from the prodigy girl meets average boy theme and the trivialities about finding what you're passionate about fighting for it and working hard to make your dreams come true there's also the topic related to the value of friendship and interpersonal relationships. Obviously regarding the love story our male lead is absolutely clueless as to the girls (and his own) feelings. So it's all very innocent up to the very end. No surprises. ,28073,727,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story,28077,728,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There is a reason why the  3 episode rule  exists. Although in this case it's more of an 8 episode rule. What starts as a fairly typical school life romantic comedy (albeit with a somewhat unusual premise) filled to the brim with ecchi situations and fanservice morphs into something very real and meaningful somewhere along the way. Sorata Kanda is the only normal responsible person in Sakura Hall the old run down dormitory near his high school that no one actually decides to live in. The residents are all those who have been kicked out of the normal dorms for some reason or another and as such are generally seen as unfit to take care of the dorm's newest resident: Mashiro Shiina a (noncanonically) autistic mangaka-to-be who is an amazing artist but cannot consistently clothe feed or bathe herself properly. To summarize: normal guy surrounded by crazy peers including a pretty girl who is almost always partially naked. If this sounds generic and awful to you I can't blame you but seriously hold on a sec. It gets good.,28085,729,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've been in an anime rut for the majority of the year but today that anime was broken by this beautiful anime. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an underrated anime. What starts out as a simple comedy soon turns into a romantic drama and you can fall in love with all the characters in their own way. For anybody who's tired of the same thing look at this anime. You won't regret it.,28087,730,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Come one Anime I know you can do better than this. Can't you go two minutes without some buxom female character literally begging to have sex with the protagonist? And you too anime-planet staff: if it's ecchi then tag it as ecchi. I don't care if the rest of the show is pure as snow I watched two minutes of this and that two minutes was more explicit than the first two minutes of most pornos. I was looking for a school-life comedy not some drawn out sexual fantasy from what I can only assume is the most repressed and socially ignorant person in the history of mankind.,28099,735,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't really like drama animes but this is one of the only anime shows that are an exception.  I mean this show has a combination of almost every theme an anime show could have and I think that is what makes this anime show unique.  I mean this show almost reflects how life would be in entertainment business.  All of the characters in this show struggled with their careers future careers and with life but out of all that hardship there were also some comedy in it.  And I think that was amazing.  If there would be a show with drama in it it would be Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.,28111,740,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When i first started watching Sakurasou I was like  Oh this is just another school guy and awkward girl type Anime.  After a couple of episodes I was getting really into it I was realizing it was much more than just an awkward girl and guy type of anime + all of the house members are becoming a lot more developed and getting into the story. At the final episodes every single episode had me crying because of how the characters got attached to me. It literally became my second family it was like I was living the happiness and sadness with the characters. In the end you can't just build your opinion on Sakurasou only by reading reviews you just have to watch it for yourself and feel every emotion the Anime will offer you. Deffinitely my personal best romantic comedy slice of life Anime.,28119,744,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This would have fallen flat if it weren't for the characterisation of the central characters. A pretty basic plot rescuing a damsal in distress with a small twist and the fighting wasn't hugely compelling or particularly interesting in their animation. Only a few of the relationships interested me but some of the characters geuinely seemed to develop and impact on each other more than in a lot of series I have seen. I hated the opening and ending themes passionately and didn't notice the soundtrack at all. ,28149,748,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kurenai’s gist is that teenage secret agent Shinkurou becomes a bodyguard to a little girl Murasaki who has never seen the outside world before; and she must learn about society while living with him develop into a more resilient woman and return to challenge her oppressive family. But viewers might take a while to discover its essential concept since Kurenai chooses a convoluted path via comedy musicals slice of life and supernatural mystery. Watching Murasaki in a whimsical conversation about romantic relationships with one of Shinkurou’s neighbours for instance I started reconsidering whether the show was worth my hours. But other times I’d appreciate the unusual contrast drawn between the independent unconventional women Murasaki meets on the outside and the hopeless resigned victims she is used to seeing within her family home. Moreover the dialogue often achieves on-the-beat dramatic timing while the performances from Murasaki and Shinkurou ensure a strong emotive core to anchor the flimsier peripheral concepts.,28169,752,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Set 4000 years in the future humanity is facing the prospect of annihilation at the hands of the Gnosis beings who can phase in and out of normal space. Artificial humans known as  Realians  and combat androids are created to counter this threat.

Akagi is an incredibly good anime to watch. I watch a lot of board/card game anime and this is just a masterpiece. Its story is not so great as no conclusion is met in the anime. This is another anime which I would be pained to give any lower than I have.,28205,758,2019-04-13 21:35:40

DearS,28241,767,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I had high hopes for this anime with the premise of it being a cute funny ecchi anime that I could enjoy watching. However this did not turn out to be the case. From the first episode it shows it's true colors with ridiculous ecchi scenes that made even my jaw drop. The main point I want to stress is my dissappointment in the writers of this anime. They had a  decently  original idea that had a Chobits-feel to it and could have made it into a very enjoyable anime. What they DID do unfotunately is make a very poor plot with sub-decent characters and no ending to speak of. If you think this would be up your alley I suggest you keep looking.,28245,768,2019-04-13 21:35:40

DearS is the story about a boy and an alian girl who comes into his life in the most wierd way. The alian girl just happens to want to fullfil his every desire which makes for some funny situations. I did not really enjoy this anime but its not totally bad.,28249,770,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Wow I'm really not getting where all the hate for Dears is coming from.,28263,773,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is probably my lowest rated anime.  The STORY was poorly constructed and failed to keep my interest in any way.  It's impossible to have a completely original anime.  However there just seemed to be a lot more promise that this anime had to offer and in the end was completely overlooked in exchange for more sexual innuendos. Don't get me wrong - this anime is an ecchi anime so of course there needs to be over-the-top situations and I'm not against that.  However you can have an ecchi anime that also has a decent plot.  This anime didn't seem to understand that fact.,28283,774,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was amazing. It portrayed that a alien race crashed on earth and was accepted into society and a anti DeerS guy pratically falls for the first one he meets . It was amazing the story was well thought out and very nicely made ,28285,775,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I totally love this anime. It's about a family of royality who live in modern society. There happens to be nice siblings (3 brothers and 6 sisters) who have different but unique superpowers. Through this anime we find that one of the siblings is to be elected  King  and which some want (they have their reasonings). I like this anime because it just doesn't focus on just one character but all of the other characters as well. It takes point of views from their sides and we get to know each character a bit more throughout the episodes. I also think that this anime has some funny parts too like when Akane forgot to put on shorts and wore her shirt and only underwear to school. That was tooo funny! I totally recommend this anime!,28293,776,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Of course this anime isn't over so this is a small summation for people thinking of watching it.,28297,777,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I do like the story  Its all about who will be the next king  of this 9 siblings each of them had a screen view even do its only 12 eps they wrap everything but I do like the ending so predictable. There is no problem with the animation its well maded but if its all about animation im looking  for high graphic . I like the opening and ending . The characters well I like Akane suit in her image I like how all their siblings have each powers ^^.,28305,779,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Background-In the late 1980's the world's polar ice caps are melting due to global warming and thus causing water level to increase. With the threat of water levels rising to coastal areas like Tokyo they started the Babylon project in the early 1990's. The Babylon project is a plan to build a barrier to prevent the sea from taking the land. But thanks to the rapidly development of hyper-technology a humanoid machine called “LABOR” is being used to help project Babylon and in almost every field of the industry. Howeverit has also created the new social menace of “LABOR” crime. In order to curb such crimes from happening one after another the Metropolitan Police Department has established a special department the “Special Vehicle Section no.2”. It consists of a company of patrol “LABOR” known as PATLABOR.,28309,780,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mirai Nikki is a very dark anime that will really dick your mind but in a good way. The story follows main characters Gasai Yuno And Amano Yukki on the journey to defeat the other ten diary keepers and become God. In my opinion the character developement could have been better and felt a little rushed to me but I guess thats what happens when you only have 26 episodes. However I believe almost all the characters are pretty likable all around and will definitly leave you with a pit in your stomach as the story progresses. One thing I find to be a good aspect of the story is Yuno and Yukkis twisted fucked up love. I think that Yuno represents how love drives us to insane places and Yukki represents our fear of love that is ever present in most humans. All around this is a good anime that will leave you with laughs as well as some tears I highly reccommend this to Anime lovers everywhere go ahead and give it a watch and let me know your opinions! =,28371,791,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The only reasons this anime wasn't a 10/10 for me was I thought the sound wasn't the best it could have been and the story can be diffcult to follow. But otherwise I loved this anime and it has became one of my favorite anime's (if not my favorite) period!,28377,792,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you like dark/violent animes this one is extremely good. It has quite the cast of characters each with a very unique style of fighting and appearance. There is also has a very large twist later in the story. It comes off as a simple concept at first with events being played out based on what is written on each persons diary (phone). The constant changes turn it from being predictable to resulting in something completely unexpected. This is what makes the anime so addictive as you constantly wonder what happens next and have to watch  just one more episode  over and over.,28405,798,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Everyone has one of those friends. S/he is pretty dumb and might even be offensive at times but you love him/her anyway. S/he might really REALLY piss you off occasionally but you always remain friends because you’ve spent so much time together. Kind of like a socially acceptable Stockholm Syndrome. And that’s what The Future Diary is. It’s a disaster zone of overused tropes character archetypes and clichés. It’s chock full of contrivance deus ex machina (literally) and macguffin. The story is a convoluted mess that devolves into an indecipherable mess by the end. And yet despite all these facts… I thoroughly enjoyed it.,28431,802,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is god dam perfection it moved me in such a way I became a different person overnight the characters are loveable and always kept me on my feet. After finishing it within the day it was about 5:00ish AM and I had a breakdown because it was so great plus it did not have a second season which just killed me inside. I recently watched the Redial OVA but I wish I had seen it right after the anime because I felt empty inside Some people may not feel the same way I did about the show but it is the best anime I have seen in my entire life.,28433,803,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I realize this isn't what I would consider a overly popular anime at this point it came out in 2011 it's old news honestly but I felt like people didn't give it a fair reveiw. ,28439,804,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mirai Nikki features a fair amount of cliches sure. A disenfranchised school boy protagonist a life or death game with high stakes predicting the future etc. But it also has a lot of original ideas and elements that make it fresh and new.,28479,806,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I recommend everyone to see after the credits and even the last OVA because the story progresses!,28483,807,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My only complain; though is a small one is that there was to much blood and killing. But since I'm very sensible compared to the rest of people about this stuff it was fine. The story had humor emotions surprises questions and answers. The characters were good insane or both. When I was watching the last episode (SPOILER ALERT!!!) I was expecting an bittersweet end and of curse it was. What kind of anime hasn't one? Although they leave space for a sequel. But I think Yukki III and Yuno III might meet (not that I'm not aware that the OVA is already out but I finished watching it today) and Yukki the god might enjoy and ship their relationship (just like I do!).,28485,808,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show shocked me. I was taken by the big twist and kept on my toes about the mystery surrounding the plot. Everytime I stopped watching an episode I wanted to watch more and know more for the next day. The animation is average infact I thought the show was made in 2006 or 2007. After a very heavy episode it was always a joy to watch Murmur do some funny stuff. ,28547,821,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Straight up I did enjoy watching this BUT there are a few bones I want to pick with it. First thing first the animation style is rather good and it never seemed to go wrong there was a lot of attention to detail. The reason I marked it down was the eyes there was something very off about them but beyond that I had no issues. Now the reason I marked this so low was it's storyline and characters. Character wise I did like the majority of the characters and the way they played out but Yuno and Yuki were my bad bones the amount of times they jump personalities was kind of annoying. I also believed the 9th made way too many random  Appearances  it seemed like if they had no plans they just sent in 9th however they did make it work in most occations. I had some issues with the the way the story at times made no sense and would completely drop off. Some of the points were explained later on but they are delayed so long I simply dismissed them. I had a MAJOR issue with the ending avoiding spoilers it was just plain bad there were more options than the one they went with which at one point made no sense and didn't explain what just happened and it pretty much finished with a monlogue which is a pet hate of mine. OVERALL Good anime but lousy ending with average characters. 4.5/10 ,28551,823,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you like twisted bloody and crazy this is an awesome anime. If you like a good story with plot twists surprises and a variety of characters it's got that too. Normally I only write reviews on my blog but I wanted to share this one on here. Going by the summary on this site and on several others I hadn't really considered watching this anime any time soon. The only reason I did start it was because of a comment on another site describing it as  twisted f'ed up and bloody but at the same time beautiful and sad.  My point is if you are expecting something with very little gore and little insanity go find something else. There is blood before the opening song even starts so that should tell you something.,28565,830,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mirai Nikki commits the worst crime in anime: it does everything right yet fails completely to do something special. The story is rather good. The characters range from slightly annoying to awesome and in general are a solid cast. The animation and sound are top notch. It is a professional and well thought out production through and through. Ultimately though it is a forgettable experience.,28575,835,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I was EXTREMEY disappointed with this anime which (in my opinion) had a lot of potential but fell flat. Not very likeably characters bad plot and some ridiculous logic... no I'm sorry but this is not a good anime. The only thing that made it watchable was the comedy and suspention. Even though I hated the story and many of the characters I couldn't stop watching. It was never dull and had me saying  WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? HOLY SHIT!  many many times.,28581,838,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I first started watching anime this was the first horror title I picked up. Considering its popularity I assumed that it must be very scary. And that is true; this anime can be pretty scary at times. But it also exceeded my original expectations because throughout the story there was so much character development and character interaction. I was even surprised by how many characters I actually liked. Every episode just made me like the show more and more and kept me interested in the plot until the very end. While the anime does have its notable flaws it was still executed very well.,28593,843,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Let's make this one quick okay?  This OVA is bad.  It's pointless; the animation is awful(wrapping paper hair freakishly thick eyes terrible movement etc) the story is disconnected between the two episodes and is dumb anyway and the characters are completely detatched static and unlikable.  It was not an enjoyable experience.,28621,851,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of those shows you wonder why it even was made. The first episode story amounts to nothing except for maybe a moral about not jumping to conclusions. The second story is about remembering the past. In episode one there are fish that pop up for no reason. Also the one girl dreams about being in a dress but apparently for no reason. A lot of wasted time spent on scenery and animals making it so slow paced and boring. Ghosts also appear out of the blue. This is an anime I had to grit my teeth to finish. Good thing I got a badge for it.,28623,852,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There is a reason the badge for watching this is  Wrapping Paper is not hair . I realize this was basically a preview for a game but it was so... bad...,28625,853,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Halloween is coming up (Or already passed depending on when I finally get this review done) and so what better way to get the chills is to watch a show about corpses coming to life and killing people right? What I didn’t know about this was that there was a whole bunch more to this show that meets the eye. It brought some questions I never thought I would have to ask myself.,28639,856,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Loved this anime.  Very interesting story that was definitely something you haven't seen before.  I loved the animation very clean.  Sound was great and the only complaint I have on the characters is that they are stereotypical - the quiet shy Sakura the too-cool-for-you but popular Rin even the reserved and closed off Saber [not to mention Illiya or whatever her name was].  Nevertheless it's well-known stereotypes that we all still love to watch so I didn't have much of a problem with it.  The main character Shiro did slightly annoy me at times with his  saving everyone  bit but it was still an awesome anime that I'm happy to have added to my repertoire.  Definitely worth the watch.  Go to episode 2 or 3 when the plot really gets going.  If you still don't like it you can always drop it and only have lost an hour but definitely give it a try.,28655,861,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Normally I just watch each anime once. Just a few twice I could count them on the fingers of my two hands. This one... This one I've seen it three times and still I watch it with the same enthusiasm of the first time. There are no useless things but this does not mean that particulars are neglected. It's 24 episodes of suspense maybe sometimes slows down a bit to let you take a breath but not really that much.,28701,875,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I know I know. By the majority of the dragon ball fanbase this is hated. Though to its credit its really not all that bad. For me it seems like most of the haters are all fanboys who just went along with the hate wave. I mean it was disappointing and thats why I think it got a much more hate than it deserved. But in this review I will try to justify the goods things in Dragon ball GT and at the same time show that im aware of the negative things.,28755,884,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I know I know. Many don't like DBGT to much still It's a great show in my OPINION(keyword there I'm a big dragon ball fan). The show is great the story is pretty damn good. Goten being older is a plus for me as he was always my favorite person in the whole series. The end built for the movie even better than all the other movies. It's a must watch for a Dragon ball fan and for most that arn't even the biggest of fans.,28759,885,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm not sure why not many people like it. It was an add-on of Dragon Ball Z one of the greatest animes out. However it was merely adequate - yet still good to relive the DBZ world.,28761,886,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Its been years Uub's training is over but now we travel back to Dragonball days...well at least Goku does. many new problems and trials arise but just didn't have the same impact. If you are a huge franchise fan and don't watch this then your a quitter. if you havn't watched Dragonball Z or even just Dragonball then I say watch them 1st.,28765,887,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Ah Gurren Lagann. Now this show is one of those odd ones. It follows all the formula for a shounen series and then decides to exagerate everything about it just to show how utterly rediculous this genre is. ",28815,897,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The last series I watched before typing this so I could go on for hours but I'll try to keep it simple. Simmon is a Digger he finds treasure the treasure is Lagann a gunman (battleship) that has the ability to merge with other gunman. The small town is threatened and Simmon must escape a feat which without Kamina (Love this guy) would be impossible. Due to multiple circumstances Kamina leads a large gathering of oppressed ground people much like him and Simmon into a war. A war which decides not only their fate but the fate of Mankind. Without a doubt this anime will make you laugh cry sit up lie down. Enjoyable right to the end,28817,898,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First and foremost I must say that if you are on the fence about watching this DO IT.  It is probably one of the greater series out there right now.  The plot starts off simple enough and then slowly grows more and more epic in nature and the ride is one of the best rushes I've felt from an anime in a long time.  The actual plot of the second half isn't as good as the first half in my opinion but is still really good and provides some moments near the end that will  put you in a state  of disbelief.  This series loves going over the top but does it in such a way that it isn't corny at all.  The art simply put is beautiful.  The mechs look amazing and the character designs are out of this world.  Unfortunately as you've probably heard there is one episode near the beginning of the series where the art takes a severe drop.  I'm not picky when it comes to things like this but this drop in quality was so severe that it made it extremely difficult to continue watching and left a bad taste in my mouth for the next few episodes that drops the visual score quite a bit.  The soundtrack fits this series perfectly.  The opening theme will be stuck in your head for days and that is not a bad thing!  Pretty much all of the music in this series is addictive.  Finally the point that I feel this series does best on is the characters.  I find it funny that Kamina is always speaking of his fame in his pre-battle speeches simply because people who haven't even heard of this series know his name.  He is truly one of my favorite anime characters of all time.  The rest of the main cast is also really amazing.  Overall this series is probably one of the best series I've ever seen and really made me remember why I watch anime in the first place.,28833,904,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Absolutely FANTASTIC. greatest anime ever especially to this reviwer as it was solely responsible for bringing me out of the dumps. such a great message of spirit and hope infuses the anime. And its characters are excellent especially KAMINA [obviously!],28835,905,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Disclaimer:h the first modern anime I watched and the reason I decided to givep decades of prejudice against something I really had no reason toate.  If you haven't read the prologue to my anime life then you mightant to pop over and do that first but in reality it doesn't muchatter.  Anyhow...,28841,906,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Gurren Lagann is quite a different experience for a fan such as myself. When I started the series I had 2 things in mind;  If the plot sucks at least the redhead is attractive  and  Well... maybe it's cheesy for comedies sake! . I was right on both ends I suppose. Up until episode 17 Gurenn Lagann is a pretty funny neurotic comedy full of cheesy one liners  When you screw it in give it a hard manly twist!  and awkward sexual innuendos. After episode 17 the series takes a sort of turn towards a more serious side and I quickly started to lose faith in the series.,28843,907,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There are simply no words to describe the feelings this anime gave me. I have enjoyed it more than anything else I have ever watched and I dearly hope everyone else does.,28851,908,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't know why it took me so long to get around to this series. It had been recommended to me many times but I kinda had it on the back-burner. However one day I saw the entire first series on Nyaa Torrents and decided to grab it. I'm so glad I did. It is a hellofalot of fun. Plenty of energy humor and action. For those who haven't seen it I highly recommend that you do. It is my belief that it is a pivotal series in the evolution of modern anime.,28853,909,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mi anime favorito. Puede que al principio el estilo artistico y las animaciones te resulten extrañas pero luego las amaras. La historia es en un modo simple pero eso no quita que sea increible. La banda sonora es de las mejores que escuche al punto de descargarlas para escucharlas separadas del anime. Los personajes son increibles sobre todo Kamina que seguramente sea uno de los personajes mas carismaticos que hay. ,28885,915,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I had to bump the rating down a bit because of the ending.  If not for the ending this would have easily been an 8/10.  Instead I have to rate it a 6/10.  Without spoiling anything I will simply say that the final ending brings a very depressing end to a series that was filled with hope.  I hated what happened to Nia and Simon.,28887,916,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If this series stopped at the first season I would give it a nearly perfect score sadly this is not the case and during the second season they fuck everything up completely as far as the story goes as well as any speck of physics. Everything gets really fucking stupid... They even breath in space.... If you really like this series during the first half but don't like anime that take things way too far and get WAY too far fetched. Like... WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY over the top then stop at the first season before the time leap otherwise the second season will ruin your good memories of this anime because it takes  over the top  to an unbelievable level. You'll just be left thinking  wow this is just getting stupid . However don't let that stop you from watching the first 14 episodes. YOU WILL LOVE THE FIRST 14 EPISODES.,28927,925,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had a friend say to me recently that everyone should watch this show atleast once. I wnet back and watched just part of it and the nostalgia that came back over me was somewhat overwhelming. It has been less than a year since I have watched it yet I want to go back for the ride and go on the feel train that is Gurren Lagann. I know there are many out there that say it's overhyped or that the viewers are only there for Yoko (she is a massive plus on its side) but they are wrong. It is one of the few shows that has taught me soemthing. I felt enlightened by it. I laughed and even cried once or twice. The plot was cruel to some charactyers yet they stayed the smae old lovable people they would always be. It gave me the motivation and output to see life differently. Kamina made an idiotic rant yet it meant so much. Its an amazing show.,28953,928,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,28955,929,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Man I look at the other reviews and I actually see people taking this show seriously.  How do they do that?  This is the most awesomely ridiculous show I've ever seen in my life.  Every single action scene had me roaring with laughter.  The entire thing is one impossibly over-the-top ball of cheese.  I just had to laugh whenever Simon fights.  He starts losing then  No!  I believe in myself!  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH....GIGA DRILL BREAAAKEERRRR!!!!!!   And then he blasts through everything and everything in the entire universe explodes.  I seriously think the director of this show took all the tired old standards of mecha and shounen fight shows and exaggerated them all beyond all belief just to show how truly ridiculous it all is.  But make no mistake this show is very very fun to watch.  Tons of stuff blows up.  There's tons of really funny-looking mecha.  There's cheesy lines galore and impossible stunts.  The main character basically blows through the universe with the strength of his will.  Everything imaginable transforms/combines into a mecha.  Giant drills pop out of nowhere and suddenly embody the hope of humanity.  And there's even Yoko who is pretty much the personification of ecchi if you like that sort of thing.  ,28957,930,2019-04-13 21:35:40

STORY:9/10 Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann definitely has one of the best stories that I have seen in an anime. The pacing is perfect there is absolutely no filler and the time gap in the middle is not confusing as time gaps usually are. The story itself is actually pretty decent and entertaining and certainly feels full. There are a few unexpected plot twists here and there (which I will not spoil) that also make it more entertaining and makes you want more with each episode's passing. That is why it certainly deserves a 9/10 for the story.,28979,936,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Nothing's perfect. The story was good but for those waiting for the actual series this is a massive spoiler personally I don't mind. It was fairly romantic which isn't my favourite genre but it was good. The animation was better than most anime and considering I judge anime by its art it was good enough to watch. There weren't many tracks in the anime so there wasn't much to go wrong in the sound. The characters were good the opposing characters were good for their parts as well I mean nobody's perfect. Overall I give a 9 which may or may not be generous but considering that I am easily pleased it was bound to get high results.,28987,939,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I personally love this anime there is just something about the way the characters flow and work  off of eachother that just makes this so enjyable to watch. this is one of only five anime that i have ever rewatched. It combines hysterical comedy with fantastical action what more can you ask for?,28999,943,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When I first watched an episode of Beelzebub I thiught that it was a weired anime and I stoped watching it but awhile ago I could not find any anime that I could possible watch so I chose this one. And behold I sort of ended up liking it after all and sort of really liking some of the characters.,29003,944,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was a very pleasant surprise for me!,29017,945,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Beelzebub is the story of a High School delinquent (Oga Tatsumi) who one day picks up a baby (baby Beel a demon who is the son of a demon lord) by a river. As the story progresses we are introduced to a wide variety of characters as we see how Oga eventually deals with inheriting this burden.,29027,946,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ohh man! When I first saw this show I had not anticipated just how funny it would be. I'd have to say this is probably one of my all time favorite comedy anime of all time. ,29035,947,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Bellzebub is an anime that's best for people that want to pass their time with something light funny and longg enough to last a good amount of time. While the characters don't really change or evolve throughout the story they remain funny in their ways enough to draw s laugh from you even towards the end of the show. ,29053,948,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Oga is a high school student who frankly doesn't care about his fellow humanity. And yet a transporting demon believes him to be the ideal father of Beelzebub's son. In other words he's chosen as a demon prince's substitute father!And if that wasnt enough the baby's birth father told him to destroy humanity! So of course Oga tries to  dump  the baby on someone else. Athough its harder than it sounds since the baby only likes strong people and will electricute anyone he doesnt like! But how would a teenage boy raise a child let alone a demon prince! Simple Hilda the maid will teach him all the ropes. After all there was that little misunderstanding when she inerduced herself and the baby to Oga's parents leaving herself in their care! We watch as hilarity ensues as oga tries to raise a demon baby set on destroying the world while fending of others that aren't always human. ,29067,949,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Beelzebub is one of those shows that grow on you. At first it sounds too absurd to be true but give it some time and it will grow into a show that is not as good as the manga but is good none the less. It is worth to note that after episode 50 or so there is a lot of filler and two episodes at the end round everything up in a way that feels very rushed and unbefitting. That being said I would still recommend this anime because of its incredibly funny moments. The characters who all behave like delinquints (because that is what they are) but all of them have other sides to them too which you find out about later. The manga does a better job at showing that but still... ,29083,951,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Yup! I gave it an overall 10 <3,29085,952,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a very different show then what Studio Ghibli has done before talking more about a regular family and not having a continuing plot. In my mind this could have been a couple of 15 minute shorts more then a actual movie and it probably would of done a bit better since as I watched I became very confused. They time skip a lot making it sometimes hard to figure out where we are in the story but then there are things that really don’t need a time too.,29107,961,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Beyond the boundary. Here you have an immortal half demon male protagonist. Really does sound like me though heh XD. Anyway and there are two protagonists in this anime and one's a girl who has blood so cursed its like acid. These two meet become great friends and deal with some normal problems like rent; and some not so normal problems like fighting demons. if you want to watch a good anime with lots of ships and cool characters this is the one for you,29179,974,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Synopsis,29235,981,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Beyond the boundary is a very interesting anime all the way through the only downside is the ending. I wont do any spoilers but i feel there was a lack of information on what happend though its still a good ending. I started off skipping beyond the boundary when it first came out but i regret it now as it was really good with a load of funny interesting characters where one is a perv who love glasses but overall the idea of the main male protagonist being this over powered creature is always good to see as it makes for a interesting story. I would higlhy recommend this anime to the fans of supernatural anime and it even has a great romance side to it which we havent seen much of just yet but theres definatly hints of it. Hopefully there will be a season 2 to carry on this amazing anime but unfortunely the ending didnt leave much hope for one but you never know.,29247,982,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was apparently an entry that got an honorable mention (no winners...) in some kind of contest for light novels held by Kyoto Animation. If this got animated over the other entries it makes you think how bad the rest must have been. Seriously this was one of the worst stinkers of Autumn 2013 for me and it had some stiff competition.,29249,983,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To call Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou “slice-of-life” is quite thenderstatement for this anime is not merely a “slice” of life; it’she entire goddamn pie.

I found this anime innately creepy. Either I'm misunderstanding a pretty major concept or this anime is one of the most perverted ones I've ever seen because it appears to feature shota-con. The relationships were all creepy namely the one between Mira and Kyousuke because of their significant age gap as well as the implication they have been having sex for a long time. I didn't really let myself like this anime because of the implicit paedophilia but it was okay.,29301,994,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I like yaoi. i came across papa to kiss in the dark and as i watched it.. it was weird. i thought maybe at some point they would explain how the father and son weren't related. i saw  half of 1 episode when the father and son kissed i just had a twisted chill. i wont be able to get through this ,29347,1000,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Initially I thought Queen's Blade was rather dull watching the first few episodes. Then it got to episode 5 and quite frankly I'm glad I decided to give this anime another go. It surprised me with how well told the story is. The characters are very endearing and the animation is great. Initially it had disappointed me but then redeemed itself by delving into it's potential and the results showed. While still flawed it told it's story magnificently and then it hit home. I honestly am glad I decided to delve into it further I did it with Fractale and that sadly still fell short but this didn't. It hit home (especially episodes 9 - 12).,29373,13,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Usually when my friend forces me to watch the first episode of an anime I don't like it at all. So when she told me she was going to show me the first episode of El-Hazard I was like:  Oh no not again.  But this time was definately different.

I felt like the plot behind this movie was broken. I liked the themes they decided to focus on as Kakashi is one of my favorite characters ever and I love his saying about rules and comrades.

As of episode 8:,29481,55,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I will preface this review with a somewhat obvious statement: If you did not like the original you aren't going to enjoy this one. If you enjoyed the first you will probably enjoy this one too. I will start out by saying that the first episode or two will be a punch in the stomach for those of you that were thrilled by the end of season one... because they basically go back to square one. Or worse. And it is just as... frustrating as the small set backs in season one but if that doesn't make you fall more in love with the series then you probably couldn't have finished season one and wouldn't be giving this season a chance. I will also note that this series is only 12 episodes giving it a feeling of missing some attachment I had for season one which is a little disappointing but that isn't by any means a completely negative comment. That said I shall get onto the bulk of the review.,29483,56,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a fairly good anime. It has a good plot to it but sometimes I donot like that it goes off on to too many side stories and sometimes you can loose track of the main plot. But the story line is still really good. This anime has very good animation to it. The animation at the begining of the anime is a little wired but as the anime goes on the animation gets better in the details of the characters and the moves that they make during the games. I like the voices of most of the characters if they are subbed and some of them dubbed and some of the voices ofnthe characters leave something to be desired. I like the sound of most of the music in the anime. Most of the characters are fantastic and just pure awesome. So over all this is a really good anime.,29505,67,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is an adult based OVA with full of nudity and fan service. People who want to see lots of boobs can watch this OVA. In the end there is a little bit of love shown by the main character.     ,29507,68,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Chuunibyou was one of those shows labelled as a high-school comedy and I really had no cause to think otherwise until late on. It had a lovely cast plenty of good humour in the right amount and managed to somehow make something that should be cringe-worthy actually adorable. The chuunibyou syndrome is something a lot of people can relate to.,29549,82,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Like Toradora but with a good ending where he actually fights for the woman he loves instead of spending 20 agonizing episodes blue balling us and then finally confessing to each other and gettnig married and then getting left in the lurch and just being like  welp at least she's being responsible now!  Wait this is a chunibyou review not Toradora right? Love the  moeblob  chara designs and FINALLY I have a chara I can cosplay with Aimee - The Dark Flame Master!!

As a lifetime fan of yugioh in general I can honestly say this is my favorite installment in the series.  It introduced some of the coolest cards in the series has a beautiful theme song .  And the duels were excellent the animation is great and I love the characters .  I'll always have a nostalgic love of the first two but I feel this did the themes of fighting and friendship the best its a contender for my favorite anime of all time . ,29643,107,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I watched this Anime as a recommendation.  For me it was really weak.  Almost the whole Anime was not strong until the very end where they finally focus on Misuzu.  I feel like the whole beginning to middle-ish was wasted on the two girls whom to me didn't really matter to the story.  They were just two characters with overly-depressing stories that did not pertain to what to me was the real purpose of the show the flying girl.

Okay so I know I may sound a little harsh. But in honesty I didnt much understand the anime and when I looked at forums I found varying theories and understandings. So overall at first glance this anime can be confusing. After a second time I was able to pick up a little more and after much thought have a solid understanding of my own interpretation. However even going on that the anime isnt very clear in its intentions. ,29673,120,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A great anime not one of my all-time favorites but definitely in my top ten I loved all of the characters but I was still confused when Yukito left Misuzu but he was still there in the form of the crow not a very easy to understand but a very emotional anime the bond between Misuzu and Haruko is amazing and the ending is shockingly sad I just wished he could have done something to save her this time.,29681,124,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As a note I read the manga but that was years ago. I know the anime differs greatly from the manga but I like the additions because they ease a bit of confusion that the manga presented.,29687,125,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I'm sorry. I'm just not going to put this out there as one of my favorites. Air had all the elements of a compelling story but I'm going to go on record in saying that I don't think it was well executed. You had two sets of stories that were completely irrelevant to the overall storyline. I understand this was adapted from a Visual Novel. But I feel like the other girls were placed in the series as a means to torture Yukito. ",29708,131,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story,29711,134,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of my favorite little anime. despite what others say I liked the charactors of the main story because they all related to the world in some wayeven if at times they didn't feel nesisary to progressing the main plot. the order of eliments could have been improved with the flashback to the origin story being less jaring when you watch but that aside I liked how eliments from one point of the story were touched on and explained later in the second run though from the birds perspective. What really got me about the story is it wasn't a happy ending it lead you along the emotional roller coster up and down like maybe after all taht thigns would finally work out. but it has such a sad way of ending. you can delay the enevitable but breaking the cycle isn't so easy. true kanon is a simmaler kind of story in roots and style but that had a happyer ending then this one and so for me has a differant tone for who I would recomend watching this or kanon. ,29712,135,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ah. Air the only word that comes into mind is  sad . and i don't mean that it’s sad as in depressing. But i mean the word sad as the word you say when a really fat skateboarder smashes his face in the concrete after pulling an impossible move.  sad  as in wow the poor fellow was trying so hard but failed....pretty bad. But when this skate boarder hurts himself. you'r not laughing you just payed money to see this kid do something awesome. and he just wasted your money.,29716,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40

GAAAAOOOO! Is what I got out of this… The one person Ictually liked was the Aunt. She was awesome but other than that it wasediocre and full of drama fluff that drove me up a wall. The best set ofpisodes was within the third arc of the series. It takes place way way backn the past. The story felt better told and it ends tragically in that archich is probably the main reason why I liked it. Lots loved this show and Ian see why but it’s definitely not for me even though the drama wasemi-decent.,29719,140,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Air is a chilled out drama romance anime with aspects of supernatural fantasy. I got major Clannad and Kanon vibes. This anime is a lot like Clannad IMO think the supernatural aspect of that anime but more. IMO only people with bad taste could hate this anime especially after watching all of it. Perhaps it is for a more tasteful and mature audience? I honestly found little to hate about this and it was less boring than other more story-driven action-packed anime. My eyes were peeled to the screen at all times. This is a lot like Clannad and if you're wondering which I mean both.,29727,142,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So I didn't get the story of this animé very well. It confused me once in a while and the switching perspectives used in Air don't make it much easier. But even though the story was to difficult to understand I think this animé is very beautiful. Especially the episodes in the end made me cry. The episodes I liked the best where the episodes that explain where the girl in the sky and Yukito originally came from. Some of the stories around specific characters Michiru and Sora kept confusing me.,29731,145,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story is intriguing! It was one of the first anime I ever saw. I love the animation it is beautiful! And the characters are all very memorable . The only complaint I have is that the anime switches to an old era with different characters who are tied to the main storyline. It was presented in a confusing way with not a lot of warning or detail. However I do love the use of drama in this anime,29740,149,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The first was great and this one slightly improves on the orginal with the continuing story of Rune Balton as the film begins exactly where the first one left off and this film focuses on Rune re-covering from her wonds in a place called Paradice then it switches to a rather intresting game of gamberling in the second half. The first one had alot of action and was very fast while it is the same length as the first one there is hardly action in it and Rune Balton's revenge starts to become less violent as it was in the first one but I find it more interesting...,29746,155,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Fine film length story involving the Bebop crew attempting to stop a madman. The animation sound and English voice cast continue it's high levels of quality. The characters motives and backstory are all explored and some scenes (the ending and the monorail fight) get my vote for some of the best anime scenes ever. Just one piece of advice. Only watch this movie after you have watched the series. otherwise you will struggle to find a reason to care about the characters.,29756,163,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay so this anime really had a so-so first season but this was overall an improvement. The visuals were beautiful the story between the fights was magnificent with little to no disappointment at all some of the characters were really amazing and the interactions between some of those said characters were actually well executed. That being said it did have it's flaws. First off the fights were overall boring (with the exception of Leina's fight with Aldra) as most of them involved a bunch of idiotic dialogue and anti-climactic win tactics that ruin the atmosphere. Second some of the characters really served no purpose such as Nyx and Melpha. It was almost like they added them in for the sake of they needed more characters. And finally the part where Risty gets possessed by Queen Aldra made almost no sense you might as well have just put the word abracadabra over everything Aldra was saying. ,29759,166,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When watching the series I expected my rating for story to be lower. It seemed it was mostly filler episodes with hardly any episodes dedicated to the main plot. It wasn't till later did I realize that the show had a lot less filler than I thought. Those random episodes now seem less random when you connect the dots. The problem is that all of the important information in one of these episodes can be summed up in a few minutes. They just stretched the story a lot longer than it should have been. That could be bad for some people but I still enjoyed it. There were still a lot of episodes that were completely filler and the show didn't need it. They could have cut the show down by fifteen episodes and would have been the length of a standard series.,29796,186,2019-04-13 21:35:40

After many torturous struggles and the loss of Inkidu he was entombed.

This  DVD Special  is Episode 4 from the series. For whatever reason they decided to leave the episode out of the original run on Japanese TV but added to the DVD and for subsequent runs.,29820,198,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,29821,199,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What can I say? I absolutely loved this show. Although the animation is older looking they do it all very well the story was great and the main thing I don't like about this show is how it doesn't have a season two. It was fantastic,29822,200,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story of the Crow is incredibly funny and well animated. However there isn't much to the story of the show since it's first half is overflowing with fan service. However the show has a fairly decent soundtrack and the battles while fairly thoughtless are awesome to look at. Air Gear is a show about high schoolers and their big dreams t become kings of their sport. It is a must watch for high schoolers but will grow stale with age.,29823,201,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's a nice day to read dear reader.  Read on as I lose my train of thought and repeat the same thing but in a different wording.  Ah well Air Gear is worth reviewing because half the other people don't know what they are talking about.,29829,203,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It is definetly one of the  funner  shows I've watched. On the surface it's nothing too special. Another one of those 'dime-a-dozen' Shounens but once you start watching the show you understand what makes it so great.,29830,204,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Just looking at an overview of this series and it doesn't really look like it's anything special.  The concept seems like it's been done before and the characters don't seem all that interesting.  But then it happens you start watching the first episode and you're surprised that you find yourself enjoying it and then you watch the second episode and then the third and before you realize it you're already halfway finished.  And that is what makes this series so good.  You start out thinking that it won't be anything special but then when you actually start watching it it draws you in and you start enjoying it.  The concept has been done many times before but the only difference is that Air Gear seems to make more enjoyable.  It's story stays interesting throughout the entire series and also manages to have a good blend of both action and comedy as well as being somewhat emotional every now and then.  The animtion is anything great to start out with and as it progresses it begins to go down in quality and yet strangely enough I didn't really mind it all that much.  Though it was still noticable so that was a problem.  The music wasn't all that great in my personal opinion but at the same time it seemed to fit with the series so prefectly that it did add a certain something to the series.  The characters were like the series not very original but still much like the series I found myself enjoying the characters nonetheless.  Overall I found the series to be extremely enjoyalbe and actually went to read the manga just so I could see what happens next.,29832,206,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime.  Has a great story good animation and the characters are easy to get into. The reason why I gave it 5/10 is they stopped making it right in the middle of the series.  I guess it didn't get good enough reviews over in Japan which sucks because everything about it was awesome.  It sure is a waste though.,29833,207,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A very good sports anime not one of the more emotional ones that I usually watch but definitely an amazing plot the characters were a little mismatched but when extremely different things that are normally bad on their own come together to make one great thing it just shows how a conglomeration can become something amazing. I loved Ikki and the girls from Sleeping Forest especially how Ringo always looked out for Ikki from an older sister's point of view. I also loved Semka and how she was always there to cheer Ikki on and when the time came to take Genesis and join Ikki's team the only bad thing about this anime is the ending I don't know if they might make more but ending halfway through the story isn't a cliffhanger it's just bad storytelling all in all this anime would probably rank in my top 25.,29834,208,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime what a fantastic one but I can t give it the score I'd like to because of the way it ended I seriously think there should be a second series to this so people can have all the questions answer that they now hold because of the ending. The art was well done and to be honest this anime was something I really did enjoy watching.  (Sorry this is my first review),29843,213,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime has a some what good story line to it but sometimes it is a little confusing. I like that there is one main goal for the main characters to follow. The animation of this anime is fairly good. Some of the characters in the anine have very good details to them. I don't like some of the songs in this anime espacally the opening and the ending songs. However I like some of the songs trough out the anime. I also like some of the voices of the characters. Some of the characters in this anime are a little weired but I still like most of them.  Overall this is a very good but weired anime to watch.,29851,217,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have recently started back up with the series and have give it much concideration to finish it as much as I also would want others to finish if you haven't already. As a great series Air Gear is an under rated anime/manga that others should reconcider to read rather than watching the anime. With the manga continued unlike the anime which ended on a bad note most of the character development happens slowly. The story is what really draws you the viewer into the series the main character not so much; Iki in the anime makes you want to punch him in the face (mostly because the way the animators made him out to be not as much of his character in the manga). He is more on the line that he has a brain but rather steroitipically be the perverted horny japanesse little boy that he is. Altough the rest of the characters in the series are well thought out and give great support towards the main character which helps him develop more thought the story. Over all this series deserves the reconition and attention that it needs along with more supporters for the animators to re-boot the anime series; this is a great series to read do no watch the anime. Just Plan Horrid,29853,219,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Oh Nellie!  I have to admit I'm a bit ashamed to have watched Air Gear but to my surprise (and likely an increase in my shame) I actually kind of enjoyed it.  So without further ado let's break it down:,29854,220,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i got to say i really loved this anime unfortunatly as many others before and after it ends just when the fun starts so i recommend that people also read the manga sports anime and supernatural anime is becoming mixed more and more instead of the common RPG kind of anime with fairy tales and stuff and something like this alitle closer to reality and competative  shows  makes it just more fun and even if its only skates just by adding motors the creator mad it so unbelivably fasinating and fun to watch and ofc the lilte goffy main character with the unbelivably instinctive skills,29855,221,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story- The story does not ask much nor show much as it follows quite a simple path. A boy seeks to find a girl he saw one day and this leads him into a new world he never new existed,29856,222,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm not what you'd call a fan of sports anime but recently I've found that shows like Eyeshield 21 and Hajime no Ippo have well constructive narratives and interesting characters that I actually care about. And then theres Air Gear. You could argue that this isn't a sport anime but seeing as it is done professionally I would say that it counts. But does it stand tall as an entertaining series with a plot to match?,29857,223,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Air Gear is honestly something I never expected to watch.  I've seen it on my regular sites for around a year now I've read the reviews synopsis even seen a couple clips.  It was just something that never seemed like a series that could grasp my attention...I was wrong.  I sat down the other day suffering from the lack of inbetweens during my regularly scheduled addictions (OP Bleach Fairy Tail etc) began Trick: 1 and before I realized it I was on Trick: 10 and 45 minutes late for work.,29860,224,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The only reason I gave it a 5 for animation is that it is in 4:3 format and not 16:9. The story is great the characters are introduced and explained. Although the manga does a better job at most of these mainly because it is stilll going. The concept is great and I found myself wanting a pair of ATs.,29861,225,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY of Air Gear was one I really liked.  I easily enjoyed this series and thought that the Air Trek plot with the different gangs was a lot of fun.  This is probably more of an anime that is going to rely on the characters rather than the plotline.  Even though I don't normally like this kind of anime I think that the plot was strong enough that both enhanced each other.,29862,226,2019-04-13 21:35:40
 I think Persona 4 The Golden Animation is additional show for fan of Persona 4 The Animation. The aim of this show is enjoying character. Watching this you should do after you have watched Persona 4 The Animation.,29863,227,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I REALLY hate to judge an anime before seeing how it plays out but Persona 4 The Golden Animation is an exception.,29865,228,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i love love LOVE horimiya. the manga is AMAZING. i know these are only ovas and doesnt capture the story in full detail but i feel if i hadnt read the manga i wouldnt have bothered finishing the first episode.  you don't really understand their back story and understand them as much and i kind of had higher expectation on the animation. still the manga is amazing its a MUST READ. i cant really say the same about the anime though,29868,230,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I read horimiya's manga so i was really disappointed when i found out there was not an anime series based on because i thought: c'mon this is a really gret shoujo series with good comedy and a main couple with a realistic funny and interesting relationship. why there's no a tv show already?,29870,231,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you like Ghibi movies- especially Totoro- You'll love Ronja! I love the 3-d/cell shaded animation that is used and the background art is gorgeous. There are lots of wonderful sound too from the wildlife in the bacground to the crunching of snow. The characters are cute and while the adults seem one dimentional Ronja and Birk are multi facited. A great story for anyone of any age.,29871,232,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Although this is a review section I want to point a few things out about this series before going into that.,29876,233,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Im from seden and grew up with this story and i really liked it and i looked forward to the anime when i heard about it but when i watched the first ep i was really disappointed when i saw the animation.,29886,234,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Doraemon is a mangaeries later adapted into anime created by a mangaka duo named Fujiko Fujio.heir names are Hiroshi Fujimoto and Moto Abiko. The manga ran for a very longime from 1969 to 1996 and at the end weighed in at 45 volumes. In 1973 itas adapted into an anime series and it still running despite being dropped byarious directors. In total the anime series’ total number of episodes is ataggering 2165(!) thus making it the second longest animated series in Japannd most probably in the world. The series also has an impressive 30 movies.,29889,236,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I initially watched this anime because it was about vampires. Then I caught onto the story line and my inner yaoi fangirl squealed at all the hinted romantic history Shido and Cain but I got very tired very quickly of Riho who was very annoying. I didn't really like her character design either.,29901,242,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's sad to say this OVA is underrated. I believe for the most part it's due to the animation or lack thereof. I see this as being more like a visual novel than an animation. I think many will feel reluctant to watch anime with such an alternative art style but despite the lack of animation and most of this being a collection of stills I found the art beautiful and the soundtrack is entrancing.,29904,244,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay! My second review! Ever since I saw a trailer for this anime I was very interested in it! So it's only natural that I eventually got around to watching it. I don't know a lot about the  Steam Punk  genre that's really exploded in popularity in the anime community but I am fascinated by it. The machines the airships the fashion! And here seems to be a good anime that really gives you a nice taste of it.,29932,265,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:  Last Exile is constantly thrilling and exciting.  I found myself having marathons through it because I couldn't wait to see what came next.  There were a couple of details at the end that I was left dissappointed by.  I do agree with a lot of reviewers for this anime that the inclusion of the Sci Fi element was completely unnecessary and only served to muddy the steam punk aura of the anime (which was completely working.)  However in spite of that I really enjoyed the story.  The fact is that after the first episode I was completely hooked.  For this show the smaller problems in the plot did not turn me off to the anime as a whole.,29933,266,2019-04-13 21:35:40

With the children of the worlds greatest Vanship pilots as the protagonists could this show be bad. I don’t think so a slow start and flashy end but if you follow it and understand it throughout I highly recommend.

I haven written reviews for amines before so I don't think my comment gonna have a lot of detail but I'll say something anyway. I Liked the anime a lot even though I don't like these kid of amines to often like like how the in the first episode the main character thought the teacher was her love from middle school but was mistaken. But then she ACTUALLY could about 3 minutes later. I also like how at first the guy doesn't care about any thing at first and then while the story goes in he starts to warm up to the gulf. This anime made me laugh and me me sad at some part but its a good anime I I hope you like it to. :D,29961,283,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Are you tired of typical romance animes what involves tons of boobies pantie shots accidental falling where the gravity helps guy to be on top and where are 10000 girls following one same guy? You are in luck because Ao Haru Ride is not one of them. It is actually quite opposite and girls who fall in love with the same guy is really really low. Also there are many cute moments. Do not wait and order the  Ao Haru Ride  today while there is special offer still going. By the way there is no special order!,29966,285,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love the two prequels of utapri and im a big fan to the music as well as the characters and their devolpment. However  I have to say I am thoroughly disaponted in this season it did not meet the expectations I had  and I bet many others had when we learned of this new seasons. It did not pick off the tourch that had been lit from the 1st season  which was continued in the 2nd it just burnt out or should I say is very dim close to burning out I hope that at least a new season would bring back that bright flame and wow us again with its infamous songs and spirit. I expect when they make the new season it would be good since on the last episode they said  see you again  which was done similarly on the 2nd season. ,29976,292,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"As much as I loved the past two seasons this season was utterly disappointing in comparison. Many contributing factors to the show in previous seasons seemed non-existent in the third and overall the content and general feeling of the show has now become shallow and lacking in interest. ",29978,293,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As an Uta-Pri fan who has watched this series and every prequel as they came out I have to say that I'm not impressed by the latest addition to this title. While the addition to the series presents great animation and sound as always both 1000% and 2000% were more in-depth in that the characters actually had meaningful encounters and relationships with each other.,29979,294,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kono Naka ni Hitori Imouta ga Iru (Nakaimo) is a harem ecchi anime mystery about a guy trying to find out which of a group of girls is his younger sister. The possibility that one could be his sister is getting in the way of a goal from his mother that he must get a girlfriend to eventually marry. I prejudged this anime due to my severe dislike for the genre. And I promised myself that I would give it more than 1 if it at least revealed who the sister was. Nakaimo has too many problems an initially fragile story and having too many terrible trope features of the genre. I actually got bored and ended up having to drink in order to keep attention. Maybe not worth watching.,29989,301,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I intensely disliked this,29992,302,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I thought this was gonna be the same incest level as oreimo but this is WAYYY worst. Some of the girls sleep topless with shougo and theres this one girl who walks around his house naked. There isnt really much to it except a bunch of girls wanna marry a guy but one of them is his sister but hes not sure who. At least shougo wasnt a big perv. However the animation was excellent and i liked a few of the characters. But dont waste your time with this unless you have absolutley nothing else to do.,29994,303,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kampfer is your typical harem with a bit of a twist the male lead Natsuru can transform between the sexes. Yes you read right he can transform from boy to girl and back again. I thoroughly enjoyed idea because not only were people after this guy side but his girl side as well. I know the idea is not new Ranma ½ comes to mind but it is done in a way which was interesting and worked well.,29999,306,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well for the most part I thought it was a good concept for a story with a couple interesting characters (Shizuku). The group that made the animation had the right idea but tried to cram the whole story into 12 episodes. I think the series needed to be at least 24 episodes long and obviously some more plot development depth and more character back stories (they just started somewhere in a person's life and went from there).,30015,311,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,30016,312,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a great anime if you want something that is just kinda weird. Has a great story but having a guy that turns into a girl really isn't my style. However it is a very funny series. I'm not sure if there will be a 2nd season but it does feel kinda rushed toward the end. ,30018,313,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not being a major reviewer of sorts I just need to come here to somehow make sense of the wasted 4-5 hours of my life.,30019,314,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime... some words that immediately come to mind are horrible terrible and completely insubstantial in every single way. At the start it seems like it has possible potential with a goofy gender-bending story. No spoilers but it only goes downhill from that first episode. The story is dropped the characters have no development or likeability there is absolutely nothing good here I cannot stress that point any more. Well the animation isn't terrible but that's like playing a video game for its graphics; You're missing out on what makes it an enjoyable experience. Once again no spoilers but episode 11 was the most infuriating episode of any anime I've ever seen. And episode 12 the last episode? Let's bring up a completely random side story that gives no end to the main  story .,30024,315,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Teenager Senou Natsuri is NOT your average teen. Especially when he becomes a Kampfer who's main purpose is to fight. However there is a catch all Kampfers can only be girls. Whether it is defending himself/herself from his/her team mate Akane or running away from vicious lovey dovey fangirls Natsuri has her/his day cut out for him/her.,30027,318,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There is one word to describe Fist of the North Star(Hokuto No Ken)- EPIC.,30049,329,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ok This is my first review so just bare with me. I'd figure that i'd start out simple with a simple anime i know straight from the heart. Hokuto No Ken AKA Fist of the North Star. A Fun exciting bloody adventure about a man named Kenshiro who's had his girlfriend kidnapped by a blondie named Shin nearly killed and left for dead. The only problem is Kenshiro comes back. And he's pissed. Oh did i forget to mention Kenshiro knows a secret martial art named Hokuto Shin Ken that can make people explode from just a single touch. Learn that well because he uses it. A lot. Along the journey for revenge are two kids. A boy named Bat (or bart the sub i watched had me confused) and a 5-year old girl named Lin. There's a whole lot more story to it but that's all too complicated to be put into one single review. Plus i'm lazy so i'll leave it at that. All and All it is an interesting story that pulls you in exceedingly well.,30050,330,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had seen episodes of this over my friend's house and my opinion of it is that its a great anime.  That is if you like an anime with a lot of blood guts and violence.,30053,333,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Like my other Pokemon reviews this review is based off of the JAPANESE VERSION of the movie not the English dub.  I will use the English dub names since people will be more familiar with them in the review however.,30055,335,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Romeo x Juliet is based off Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet obviously.Romeo meets a girl named Juliet and obviously they fall in love however it's not until later when Juliet finds out that Romeo is the son of the tyrant ruling over the land who she wants to kill. It's not long after that Romeo finds out that Juliet is the surviving daughter of the Capulet family the  evil  family (he was tricked by his father).,30056,336,2019-04-13 21:35:40
DO NOT WATCH THIS IN JAPENESE.  To get the full of effect of this show you MUST watch it in english.  The voice actors did an AMAZING job bringing there characters to life.  But that is not why you must watch this in english.  The speech they used is brilliant.  I've taken 10 qoutes from this show just from the first 5 episodes.,30057,337,2019-04-13 21:35:40

well any way to say on this one of best series i seen.,30064,342,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I am a fan of Shakespeare. That being said this isn't the normal Romeo and Juliet story but I loved it anyway. A fair warning that's a slight spoiler. It ends like the play. If you imagine it won't you are idiots. Most everything other than the fact that the families are warring is different. It’s a fantasy anime so of course it is. That being said it keeps the feel of Romeo and Juliet without being as long winded and is somehow more inspiring and less boring than the original. The changes make it seem more fantastical. There is more drama; it's more romantic than the original play and more interesting. I love the characters. Juliet is not I repeat NOT a damsel and doesn't need Romeo to save her and though he does she saves him just as much. It's an amazing retelling that would either have Shakespeare rolling over in his grave or proud that his play inspired something this awesome. Everything is beautiful the music the art the story. It’s a must see.,30065,343,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've read the play and if your thinking that this is possibly different than the play there is not much difference. Either way its basically the same! If you cried during the play (or if you watched one of the movies) you will definately cry at this.,30066,344,2019-04-13 21:35:40

finally watched gundam after years of enjoying animes i was weary of this title. Starting with a vague plot that takes time to get its legs going ths show then gathers enough momentum to keep you invested till the finale. The characters are well developped and the gundams design is of good enough qualities. the outside secenery/battle scene animation could do with more detail though. THe one thing that lets this anime down in my opinion is the music. Just finished watching it and i cant remember even a song from the whole anime... The characters are a good mix flawed and heroic and all...they have enough issues and enough will to fight their fate that it's easy to care for them. Overall we have a good anime from this series of GUNDAM superior in my opinion to SEED  ,30075,350,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Intense adrenaline-pumping action-pacted tragic head-spinning five words that may truly describe this anime. I have to say that this one really impressed me. It was your typical Death Note only they used machines in place of a notebook. Oh and not only do they have the some similar qualities but also the person who voices Light in Death Note voices in Gundam 00. ,30081,356,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Seitokai No Ichizon Lv. 2 is a worthy successor to the first season. All the main and supporting characters are back with the addition of 3 three other supporting characters who only add the the enjoyment and watchability. The daily activities of the Hekiyou Academy Student Council remains pretty much the same. That is to say they spend their days goofing off and not actually performing student coucil activities. The banter between Sugisaki Ken and the four girl members is superb and the entire show is wrapped up in the most perfect way. The re-watchability of this series is a perfect 10/10. I recommend this and the first season to everyone and anyone.,30091,364,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Seven deadly sins is a nice anime for those who loves adventure and action. This anime has a nice action scene and a very hilarious scene. Some scenes can made me laugh like hell. This anime has a very soft ecchi as well. So it's quite entertaining. But what dissapoints me is that the anime didn't finished. In other words a very bad ending. The ending is obviously unclear and it makes me pissed because they didn't continue the anime anymore. But overall this anime is not too boring. :),30094,367,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The Seven Deadly Sins was a awesome show! I watched the first episode and I got hooked! I didn't expect to watch this whole anime in just 2 days. That was how good this anime was. The story was good animation sound characters are amazing. This show might be a bit cliche but cliche is not bad at all. I would recommend the people who haven't watched it to give it a try. It's Shounen/ Action/ Comedy/ Romance. Give it a try! :),30096,369,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I first watched this I was prepared for it to be slow-paced and boring throughout most of the anime. But I was a bit shocked that as I watched on her character developed well and truly caught me by surprise. I found the plot line to be well thought out and wished this was extended more but... I'm fine with the ending. This anime left a deep impression on me. I've been trying to find one similar -- meaning a girl who gets stronger and wiser as the story develops -- but I couldn't. This was an anime I found to be unique and like a breath of fresh air.,30134,395,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tokyo Ghoul Root A Review:,30138,398,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I enjoyed the first season even if it didn't (couldn't really) live up to the hype.  The second season upholds the amazing artistic vision and the high production values of the first making it a pleasure to look at.  Missing however is the same level of plot coherence and character development.  The second season seems rushed and disjointed.  Very little is explained in the first two thirds leading up to an ending of Shakespearan melodrama which is deeply unsatisifying.,30139,399,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So I looked in a thesaurus for a word synonymous with Tokyo Ghoul √A and this is what I found:,30145,403,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What a disappointing end to a brilliant story which has only left me wondering what could have been. I have to sympathise with the anime-only viewers; they must have absolutely no idea what happened over the course of this show. In the first season of Tokyo Ghoul Pierrot cut and changed bits and pieces but it was generally enough to make sense of the story and I actually really enjoyed that first half. The same cannot be said about Root A which has made little sense from start to finish. ,30148,404,2019-04-13 21:35:40

tokyo ghouls second season kicks right off after the first and as before it is not for the faint of heart a great and intense psychological and emotional finale to the first season taking its time to show more character development and its intense story leading up to the grand finale of the series as i watched the end my heart was racing and tears were falling it was an intense feeling but one im glad to experienced due to the quality of the anime but with this tokyo ghoul is finished and personally im glad as it felt it ended perfectly and i reckon a sequel would ruin it but this is my review thanks for reading,30150,406,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hey look It's my first review! And it's also on my current favorite series right now.  Now that I've watched the 12 atrocious episodes of this trash I think it's about time I give my view on Tokyo Ghoul √A...,30151,407,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The second seasons starts as  rule of cool . However I can not forgive its bullshit conclusion and whole irrationality of 180 degree turn in Kaneki. When I saw the title of this season √A  It was obvious how desperate the producers must be. This kind of naming is what twelve years use. Opening is better than in the first season. While I can admit that second season is so far better than first It is average anime at the best. Compared to adaptations of silly light novels and moe this might seem as masterpiece. Still it doesn't change fact there are moments when it falls flat on face. There is no reason to give it more than around average scoring especially when there are way better alternatives such as Parasyte.,30152,408,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Yeaaah... I watched it on one breath just after the first season and I am disappointed.,30153,409,2019-04-13 21:35:40
In comparison to Tokyo Ghoul the first season Tokyo Ghoul Root A was a stepdown from its predecessor. When I heard that it was an original storyline I thought  Oh it can't be that bad but turns out I was pretty wrong. ,30154,410,2019-04-13 21:35:40

after being pleasantly surprised by the first series i had high expectation for this season. the pace at wich the plot moves is very deliberate sometime slow but it allows for reflexion on the show's subject matter : who has the right to live ? who can possibly pass judgment on another species for their right to live ? the animation is still good and the writers let us delve deeper in the characters stories without distracting us too much from the plot. The action scene do their job but intrude a bit more on this season than the previous one hopefully we get a third season to round up a great story.,30157,413,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't wait till they release season 3,30165,421,2019-04-13 21:35:40
kind of disappointed!  After that INCREDIBLE ending of season 1 expectations were bound to be crazy high.  What I really wanted to see from the second season is the emotion behind kaneki's change.  I wanted to see a slow descent into madness which we got a little but after he initially looked like he was totally losing it not much else happened with that and the show focused on the big battle instead.  Kaneki's transformation IS the show!  That should absolutely be the focus.  I wanted to see how this affected touka more as well because she was obviously suffering when he dropped this a-bomb about aogiri but I can remember like one angry denial scene and that's it.  This kind of stuff is pure emotion and human condition and it needs slow and intense development!  Besides this a lot of stuff that I was CERTAIN was going to tie in in a major way and blow my mind like Hide's involvement in the ghoul world who killed Rize and WHY (was touched upon I guess but only by mention this was a major opportunity for a mind effer cmon!) and aogiri's real purpose.  Is it just to fuck shit up?  That's what it felt like.  I wanted to know about Touka's brothers involvement which seemed important as well as understanding more explicitly why Kaneki joined.  To become stronger fine but why did he need to join aogiri to do that?  If they were giving him secret training or keys to power we never see any of it we only see them going around rescuing criminal ghouls.  By the end Aogiri didn't matter at all and now it is all about the owl who just kind of gets away and that is never resolved although I enjoyed finding out who the owl actually was. The two one eyed ghouls are introduced as important players then they just disappear and we never found out who sent them from that shadow in the beginning.   I wasn't totally on board with the sacrifice the ghouls made either.  They stayed and fought so that the other ghouls could leave and keep their normal lives elsewhere but why didn't they just all escape?  It was also a classic anime faux pas when touka was running for about five hours and convienently missed absolutely everything that was going on even though she was running full  blast and kaneki was slumping all over the place to reach it before her.  Maybe they just showed me too many shots of her sprinting and it got on my nerves.  The ending was probably the best part aside from the part where kaneki is turning into a cannibal ghoul.  I really felt the emotion in the room with Hide and Kaneki and it was the first time since Kaneki transformed that we saw him as the human he really was.  I'm struggling to make sense of a lot of the things that happened in that episode but I know there was a lot of significance with the red sky Kaneki's hair and Hide wanting to go home.  I think ultimately this show tried to play on the idea that both sides were killing each other and it was senseless but they didn't fully commit to that so I just kind of vaguely thought that a few times when they were showing all the carnage as Kaneki walks through the snow and thinks during his battle with Amon that it's both human and ghouls faults this happened.  If that wasn't the main point of all those scenes I don't know what is!  As far as Kaneki I suppose he needed to die to atone for what he'd done but I needed that to be resolved first.  I needed some kind of closure where he understood all the mistakes he had made and he basically is about to turn into a monster but then something stops him probably Hide and then he's free to die with a cleansed heart.  I think he could have died in another way.  Him walking through the snow stoically with Hide?  I'm not sure what that was meant to accomplish if not the idea of a human and a ghoul who are friends walking across the battlefield in each others arms and no one shoots.  I definately wanted that scene with Hide to be more developed too!  That really felt like an awesome moment and I'm confused because we didn't really get any dialouge or answers just smalltalk.  It was a nice atmosphere of friendship created that took us out of the war and Kaneki's evil and back to the beginning before all the madness just two old friends talking like nothing was different.  I was disappointed in the animation almost 100% of the time.  Lazy and stiff.  Soundtrack was good but the first season definately takes it as far as opening/ending.  ,30166,422,2019-04-13 21:35:40

 I have no idea what the hell is going on this second series so far is just a bunch of events that happen. I don't know what's going on with the characters why they make these choices or where it might all be heading i'm a big ball of confusion and anger. The music is really creepy though so they get a gold star for that and right now I'm still keeping up because of all the characters I grew attached to in the first series. I just wish they'd explain crap~!! Also why do the ghouls and or humans just sorta stare at their prey for an hour if they are important to the plot instead of you know killing them. Not a very successful form of fighting if you ask me. ,30169,425,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I added this anime to my want to watch list at some point with a bunch of others.  Then at some point I dropped it thinking that I wouldn't watch it.  I got to the point where I didn't fancy anything in my list so had a look on YouTube for some comedies that I might fancy.  I saw this one looked it up liked the sound of it went to add it to my want to watch list only to find I had dropped it.  Oh well I thought I'll give it a go.,30176,427,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think this is probably one of my favorite anime love stories I've seen in a long time. I've never shed so many tears felt excited happy sad all in one. The main character Takeo just makes you want to root for him and Suna is the ultimate bro. Rinko is an amazing herione and very unique from your average everyday love interest. So many momments where I found myself begging for more and the end has me wishing and hoping there is another season. Deffinitely a must watch if you're into School Life/Love Stories!,30187,430,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My Love Story entails the basic and simply brilliant approach to comedy and high school love. There is more than enough grip on each episode to raise your interest and put the story forward. As much as romance anime goes it usually loses its sweetness as the anime moves on from the hardship of becoming a couple to the daily perks and moments yet Ore Monogatari shows that it can continue to put meaningful development into each episode without making it monotone. The occasional cuteness overload and fun moments add to the anime's core structure providing us with a story for those who like the simple and those who want a little more from their anime. ,30191,431,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ore Monogatari is really nothing special. It's your classic romantic comedy. It's watchable. But nothing to get overly excited about. My main objection is the length: even 12 episodes would have been too many. Nothing happens after the two protagonists of the love story get together. And as for character building nothing happens there either. I'm not saying that it's a bad anime but after you get the gist of the story the first three episodes as well as the gist of the characters in those first three episodes: that's it. It just keeps going on in the same way for all the remaining 20+ episodes. So at some point you inevitably start asking yourself: why am I watching this?,30193,432,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is the first shoujo romance that ive watched that involves a less atractive person. The animation is good the story is good. Try the anime out if you like shoujo. Thanks for reading,30198,434,2019-04-13 21:35:40
An adorable romantic story of a peculiar male and cute female one never seen like before. In most romance anime there is one-sided love/crush until it becomes mutual but here both characters like each other from the moment they met so it's quite charming.,30199,435,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For a video review check out my Youtube channel. Link on my profile page.,30200,436,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Love this. Story line is creative and very realistic. The characters are very well expressed. The animation is adiquite very simple. Sound is pretty good the voices sound like they would fit the real characters. Takeo's facial expressions are histarical. The story line is really cute so are the jokes in this series. Definitly will recommend this. ,30201,437,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched this one since the beginning. It had such a great start and looked very promising. I might have expected too much of it and hoped for the anime to be a bit more 'complicated'. Instead it turns to a very VERY simple lovey-dovey anime. There are some episodes where someone does something very tiny and then the whole episode will be about that.,30202,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40
At first when I saw the cute girl and the attractive guy in the back with the  less  attractive guy in front I was like aww is this going to be stupid? But once I finally started watching it it's a mix between sad happy and just downright hilarious moments. The only complaint so far is that the story isn't moving forward very much but it has only just started so we'll see where it goes! honest good feels all around making sad moments then turning them into funny ones. I would recommend this if you like romance it's as pure as it gets where love knows not to judge looks.,30204,439,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is the first review i have ever written but looking at all the bad ratings this anime got i had to write something. I really enjoyed this anime admittedly the English dub is atrocious so if that's what you watched then yea its pretty bad. But the way the one reviewer said it was too laid back in its execution well that's what i liked about it. Its not a serious anime its funny but doesn't go out of its way to be funny. It doesn't go into depth of a middle schoolers angst but focuses more on just kids being kids and being happy. Then behind all that you have diplomatic aliens who don't try to be big and powerful just laid back and chill around drinking and doing politics. With some intergalactic intrigue thrown in.,30206,441,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One very important thing that I have to say before I do this review: The only way I could watch this was through english dubs which probably make this anime very very very very very bad. Sometimes english dubs are bearable but in this anime I dont even know why they tried. The second super important thing is... that even without that part it still probably sucks but I only figured that out after I got half way through the thing and realized that it wasnt going to get better. The end is satsifying if you like the rest but its a bit corny too.,30207,442,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I think I'm going to be different from a lot of people because I thought this movie was better than the first. Tenchi Muyo is really more about the characters than story and this movie had a lot more focus on what makes it good. If you liked the characters then there is nothing really new. The characters are the same except with the addition of a new character. If you were looking for character progression then you are out of luck. Personally I like the Tenchi franchise for the pointless fun. I don't take it seriously. So I loved the characters. I am still a little annoyed how Tenchi never really decides on who he likes.

This was an almost great anime. The only things that I found wrong were the characters and the end of the story. If you dont like a storyline where all the caracters are static. then I don't recommend this anime. None of the characters show any developement and this can be very aggrivating at times. Due to the lack of change in the characters the climax at the end is basically ruined. I can think of plenty of more satisfying ways to develope the characters which would tremendously help the plot to captivate and envelope the viewer into a rollercoaster of an anime. Overall if you're bored and are out of things to watch this will keep your attention fairly well don't get the wrong idea as I said; this was an almost great anime the problem is if the characters are bad then your storyline siffers too. I would definantly recommend this to someone interested in this sort of genre but prepare yourself for possible a little dissapointment.,30213,448,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I loved the series I really did. But that was the most disappointing ending ever. I couldn't even finish the anime after I had found out. Just saying you will either think it was awesome or sucked ass. In my opinion it did. If you like zero and Yui together or you like zero then this ending will not be in your favor. Just saying.,30228,453,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I loved this series even more than the first. With the many twists and turns that it had and the incredible ending I must say that it was one of my favorites. There was a time where I almost watched it 5 hours straight. After watching the first one and deciding to not start a different series before this one I couldn't resist going late nights just to finish. I highly recommend this to anyone who loved the first one. And for those that haven't watched the first part go watch it before you start this one.,30232,455,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I stalled out on this anime years ago at the third episode and decided to recently rewatch everything. The second season subdues the comedy for the love-triangle aspect of the anime. This might have been a bad idea. ,30234,456,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,30235,457,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this series! Well actually season 1 was a disappointment and I thought it was over like that. Phew I'm glad it wasn't. This is the type of impeccable plot that just makes you want to watch it again and again. You eventually get tired of doing that though.,30237,458,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This has been a long time coming. Honestly the reason I took so long is that I didn't really know how to approach this review. I decided that I'll just take a look at Vampire Knight as a whole. Guilty definitely far exceeds season one but that makes sense since it's a direct continuation of the plot. As such the plot is really backloaded. There's only one significant event that actually happens in the first season in retrospect. This series is really really good so anyone who instantly avoids it because of the whole vampire cliché I would say to at least give it a chance. Anyone who likes drama will love this series. All the way down to the message at the end of every episode  I will show you a sweet dream next night.  Now I'll start hammering down the mechanical aspects of the review. The characters are great really polarizing. Only three are fully developed: Yuuki Zero and Kaname. And the reason I say only is because many of the supplementary characters in their brief moments of significance are quite compelling but you never really find out much about them. If the producers were to make an offshoot of the series that featured these characters instead (sort of how Please Twins follows Please Teacher but not exactly) I think it would be quite successful. But having said that; Yuuki Zero and Kaname are really terrific characters. Zero and Kaname are very cliché but still incredibly enjoyable to watch. Yuuki is probably the best character so far as to say she goes through the most literal transformation. This is one of those series that you would kind of suspect a lot of symbolism but really the plot's complexities are always described in great detail which in some ways is a downfall. It would have been nice if the series let you think things through first and then exposed the truth. Also the pacing is a little weird. You expect and get for the most part the slow episodic drama but there are always things going on in the background which are actually quite fast-paced. The story as it goes along is quite interesting and there are some twists (though honestly you see them coming several episodes ahead of time). And though I felt that the bit of vagueness in the ending was appropriate I really thought the series could have used just a touch of tragedy to have left the viewer with more of a lasting image. So overall Vampire Knight is a very good series that lacks the certain verve meriting elite statue still 8.5 out of 10.,30240,459,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"I loved this anime it was seriously much better than the first season i gotta say. Even though the whole thing was short i still gotta say the animation and the characters were greatness. You get to see the characters better in this Season and you finally get to know the back story of Yuki. Also the full love triangle between kaname yuki and zero.

What is Magical Night Maria Chan? An anime featuring Maria Von Hossen Sylvia's younger sister. More precisely this is 3 minutes total (6x30seconds) of spoof preview done in the style of normal anime outro previews. This is entirely fictional no manga/anime was actually made. This isn't a serious thing the manga changes in volumes between many thousands and the 3rd episode of the anime is relased in 2018 when a later episode is released in 2011. This is just the creators having a laugh. Perhaps worth 3 minutes? Not really.,30278,476,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This will be a very short review. This OVA is very stylised and different. From 1987. The animation still holds up very well. It has a different art style so it maynot be attractive to everybody. It has great music very jazzy. I enjoyed the ending song/piece. There isn't much in characters. We have Toru who is the main guy and the Ghost Train X. There are others but we really don't know who they are. Apparently Toru has some connection to this mysterious ghost train. We find out that he has ESP and his Alpha waves can control the Ghost Trains Beta waves. There are some characters with nefarious ideations that I believe had the intention of building a weapon. Check it out if you want to see something different. It's artsy. Not your typical formulaic anime.,30279,477,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have the same complaint with this movie that I have with all of the others—I don’t really care too much about how things turn out because I know nothing major can happen and none of the cast from the show can die. As such I really wish they would create Naruto movies about smaller events that don’t deal with the fate of the world as we know it.,30284,478,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Typical Ecchi full of fanservice. Audiovisual setting is average. Fabular convention is not that bad but characters are totaly copied and boring. If you like a lot of plot and pants shoots you can spend one nice evening with this Anime. But if u don't really like ecchi there is no reason for you to watch it.,30313,491,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think this anime isn't really that bad. Cause the artwork of the characters were really nice and I also loved the skills and weapons that each of the characters has. But what I don't like is that some of the story in this anime doesn't makes sense. And there are lots of scenes that they skipped. But overall this anime is reccomended for those who love action and ecchi.,30327,495,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hiiro no Kakera: The Tamayori Princess Saga is an anime that made a valiant effort to be an anime that would be an excellent visual display with likeable characters and an enchanting fantasy storyline. I’d say it got about 1 and ½ out of the 3. Light spoilers ahead.,30332,500,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,30334,501,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I found this out by searching for random anime… this came up and It was in dub... soo I was like  Why not!?  ,30335,502,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The main reason I watched this anime was becasue the animation was beautiful. I agree with previous reviews that saied this anime tried really hard; it did. I loved the premis but the execution was lacking. It had a great idea and if it was done differently it would have been great. Overall I admire the animation but did not find it worht watching.,30336,503,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,30337,504,2019-04-13 21:35:40
OMG so boring.  By the 5th episode in you will be rooting for the bad guys!  I gave up right after the heroine told the antagonist she should have asked politely before she tried to steal the magical whatever.  I'm 100% sure that whoever wrote the dub script pilfered the dialogue straight from the otome game.  Hiiro no Kakera is NOT funny NOT exciting and NOT even romanitic.  Take it from someone who will watch pretty much anything: This anime sucks - don't waste your time on it!,30339,505,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime had an okay story line to it. I would have liked them to devolp the charatcers alittle more then they did. Also I think that it would have helped the story line to have developed the interactions of the characters alittle more then they did. This anime had okay animation to it. I would have like to see some more detail to the characters of the anime. But the sceanry of the anime was well animated. Also some of the characters did have some good animation to them I just think that it needed to be developed aome more. I like some of the songs that are in this anime. I liked the opening and the closing songs the most. I really liked most of the charcters and they were well developed for the most parr I just wish that there could have been  ore development between the characters that did not have reationships with each other. Overall this is anime thatI will alsways come back.,30363,518,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be honest I had no idea what was going on the entire time. Unless there's a manga of this to be found I don't really reccommend it. If you like the steamy sex scenes then you'll be disappointed - there weren't really any. Well there was one very short dream about guy-on-guy sex but other than that nada. I didn't really get the plot at all. Most of the characters were annoying.,30364,519,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is not one of my favorite anime but it was pretty good. It had a nice mixture between comedy and drama. It did a good job of transitioning from the comedy to the drama. It also had the comedy at just the right moments and not at odd moments like on some shows. Kasimasi had a good display of characters. You cared for them deeply and wanted them all to be happy. The twist in storyline was good. You as a watcher have a hard time decideding how you want the story to end. Overall I liked this show and think it was made well.  ,30378,525,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Mmhh this is a hard review. After watching this anime I just feel indifferent. Well let's give it a point in the fact that every now and then there was a couple of events that actually had some pathos in them and asked for a few tears. But really few. And that's all.,30379,526,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Asakura Junnichi lives with his sister on an island where the cherry blossoms bloom all year around. Is there magic in the air or is this a natural phenomenon? Either way it brings a romantic setting to locals all year around. Asakura does not dream but has the unique ability to explore other people’s dreams instead. Each night Asakura seems to visit a dream of a girl that he knows. What does this mean for Asakura and what does he learn from his dreams?,30381,527,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Background-In the late 1980's the world's polar ice caps are melting due to global warming and thus causing water level to increase. With the threat of water levels rising to coastal areas like Tokyo they started the Babylon project in the early 1990's. The Babylon project is a plan to build a barrier to prevent the sea from taking the land. But thanks to the rapidly development of hyper-technology a humanoid machine called “LABOR” is being used to help project Babylon and in almost every field of the industry. Howeverit has also created the new social menace of “LABOR” crime. In order to curb such crimes from happening one after another the Metropolitan Police Department has established a special department the “Special Vehicle Section no.2”. It consists of a company of patrol “LABOR” known as PATLABOR.,30386,532,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i think i would have to agrre with some ppl that this series could have been better if they kept it going and like a lot of ppl say it was almost as good as Please Teacher but i think it was the the other way around butthats what i think but it would have been nice to c more charters from Please Teacher or at least have b based more at school instead at home. but like i said i really wish they would have kept the series going,30399,541,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Please Twins. This anime is definately going to become on of my favorites (some parts made me giddy!). The story deserves between an 8 and a 9 due to the fact that it is a short series that is intended to sell manga books I just like shows that last a bit longer. The animation is rather good keeping in mind that this anime is from 2003 and this quality would have passed for exceptional back then. Keep the fact that it is an old anime in mind when thinking about the quality of the sound I find the soundtrack quite satisfactory while being overbearing or having too much repetition of the songs. My favorite part of this anime was the characters the character developement was outstanding! All three protaganists had multiple things abut them that made them unique though at times it like some of them were a bit over emotional; though I kind of like that aspect it isn't something that you see very often so I cherish the opportunity. Overall this anime gets a 9.1 and gets my recommendation to those of you who like tsundere harem (I suppose this qualifies) and brace yourselfs incest. Enjoy!,30401,543,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't really know why people rate this anime so badly. For me this series was incredibly fun. It's one of the best ecchi ever made out from an epic game. And yes it made me baw lol and no I'm not 12.,30408,548,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's a very entertaining anime lots of romance jealousy and nudity.If you're horny watch the OVA which is pretty much hentai it's quite sad at the end of this though. Theres also some gay comedy scenes which are.. quite disguisting and disturbing.,30410,550,2019-04-13 21:35:40

an amazing anime with great story characters and visual effects/ animation really enjoyed learning about the characters as i watched the development of friendship between all of them and really enjoyed how the story progressed into a phenominal finale something that you dont normally see in romance/ecchi anime  was provided towards the finale in this anime and it was amazing in bringing out emotions in viewers.,30415,554,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I want to know who I can talk to about getting the time I spent on this anime back. I spent the better part of an afternoon watching this anime and i have very  few good comments to make. First the whole anime is made like the creators just wanted to mess with you. This anime goes into the pile of trash that it truly belongs to. The characters were all just too perverted and the whole plot was just a joke. If you really want to watch this anime I cant stop you but I would insist that if you have any doubts about watching this anime you should punch yourself in the head until you have a headache because the end result will bee the same as watching the anime.,30417,555,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Another coin-op to screen cash in and sadly like many it utterly fails to be anything but mildly entertaining at best and bizzarely  inconsistent other times..

Differrent people with Differrent thoughts on this anime but me personally love this anime. don't know why but while watching this anime all the stuff on it makes me can't even think about the plot this anime took so much atention of mine. ,30437,568,2019-04-13 21:35:40
   The story's about how a girl gets murdered how the princess of a magical clan gets stuck on an island how the brother of the murdered girl finds a bottle that the princess threw out to sea... As you can see the story's quite complicated yet intriging. It started out with a nice intro but it gets  slow in the second half and the pacing's uneven. It also loses its  tragedy  aura gradually as it focuses on more  romance  in the second half. (I would've enjoyed it a lot more if it turned into a tragedy.) I feel as if the  magic  components of this show felt forced. I felt like that the story's divided into 3 arcs: first arc about getting the princess off the island second about unraveling the mystery about the sister's death third is just about relationship building. A good thing about it is its plot twists.,30438,569,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,30442,570,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was watching this anime  and wow this knock my socks off . Thats how amazing it was . There wasn't one dull moment when something happens bam something else happens . I love this anime. ,30443,571,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Here is a show I am sure we all would love to enjoy but it has some major shortfalls that prevent it from being the truly epic anime it could be and albeit tried but failed to become.  It seems too many things rest on pure insanity as opposed to rational reasoning and thinking or common sense that most humans have some small measure.  However few characters in this series seem to display any such notions.  ,30444,572,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So... a full-length review will be written here as soon as I gather my thoughts and am able to do a complete analysis of this anime. ,30445,573,2019-04-13 21:35:40

[Spoiler Free/ Shorter Review] This series is for adults not children or teenagers as such it should be given the  seinen  label.,30457,582,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was an incredible anime with alot of romance and action and mystery mixed in to one. This anime might not seem like anything at first but keep watching because this was one of the most epic story's I have ever seen in an anime. It will keep you guessing untill the very end and the romance and magic mixed together in this way was truly amazing. I liked the art work and the way the story keeps suprising you. I hade read it's description many times before actually watching it and the way they describe the anime isn't really fair to how good it actually turned out to be it hits my top 10 anime for romance and magic. It's very emotionall intense and a bit on the darker side but this anime is all about the story the action and magic is just part of it but what makes this anime is the romance part. It was also a very sad theme with alot of death and sadness in it. However I promise you that if you start watching you wont want to stop it's just one of those anime you cant stop watching untill the end.,30458,583,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story of this anime is very captivating. I love that it can hold your attention the whole way through the entire anime. I also like that is sticks to one main idea and goal all the way to the end but sometimes it goes of into the past and that can get anoying sometimes but other then that it sticks to the main idea. The animation of this anime is so epic. I love that the creators pay attention to the details of it and have great animation on the characters to make them almost look real. I like the music in this anime because it is really good and doesn't drown out the voices of the characters. Also the voices of most of the characters are really good. I love most of the characters because they are really awesome people and that some of them have powers and that is epic. I love that the partners are willing to do every thing for each other no matter what. Overall this is a really good anime.,30464,586,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,30468,587,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This a romance based anime/manga with some action.  My favorite part about this series are the characters. There aren't a ton but they are diverse in personality and have good background stories. Which helps the watcher/reader grow more affection for them. The anime just dropped. It was really good I thought until it ended. All the episodes were supposed to lead up to a some great battle which never happend. The ending in the anime was a huge kick in the teeth. Throughout the series you do have a good story line some great characters and a few good battles. I would recommend it to someone but the ending just really kills me. It makes you feel as if you watched the series all for nothing. There is a power struggle amd frankly I'm the type who wants to know who wins and looses. The episodes really build you up for a battle that never happens. There is one before the anime ends but its not the true battle.,30470,588,2019-04-13 21:35:40

While I enjoyed the concept of this anime I find there was not a lot of development. First of all they expressed the background of most of the characters fairly well yet there was little to no growth of the characters through the entire anime. In fact some seem to have gone backwards from supporting of their comrade to suicidal and barely progressed back to the original state. As far as the story is concerned it did progress however it also went slowly for a 24-episode series and stopped before a final battle. In fact the last battle had a large build up of tension and ended suddenly as well as unclearly. I would also like to point out if you intend to watch this for boy love you will be highly disappointed. Besides a build up of sexual tension there is no hint of romance. There is almost no bodily contact of any kind actually. The main  couple  in fact has no romantical aspects at all one is too busy stuck in the past in love with the partners past life to develop any sort of relationship with the partner and the partner literally doesn't look the other ones way as he is too busy obsessing over his  brother  whom he seems more romantically interested in then the supposed partner. All in all I feel it could have been a good anime but it was too rushed and focused too much on the past then the present if there had been a second season that wrapped it up it would be fine. I did enjoy watching it but wished it had been planned out a lot better. I am going to read the manga in hopes of a better outcome.  ,30484,593,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Great Story. The characters were pretty interesting. Im more interested in the new characters than the original story line I hope they have a secon d season. The weakness of this anime was the ending.,30485,594,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There are 13 episodes in total (4 for Vol 1 and 2 5 for the 3rd) that take place in ancient feudal Japan as did the film and includes a huge variety of new original characters that reminds fans why they fell in love with the film. Fascinating creatures that almost give the 8 devils a run for their money. But Jubei is not alone in this series he is  Accompanied  by the old government spy Dakuan and meets new characters: Shigure a mysterious young woman bored of her life in a remote village and Tsubute the thief thrown in mostly for comedic value in between a raging quest to find the elusive  Dragon Stone .,30519,600,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've been looking at this particular title for awhile now at Best Buy and ladies and gentleman this is show is a perfect example of why I am a fan of  previewing  before buying.,30547,610,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just picking anime at random can pretty much be equated to playing roulette you got a pretty slim chance at winning but boy howdy can you find some glorious flops. Sadly this title falls into that category.,30549,611,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In this world there exist all kinds of anime. There are good ones bad ones as well as REALLY bad ones. And then… there are some that transcend the idea of good and bad so much so that one cannot simply express their opinion of it by means of such trivial things like “numbers” or even “words”.,30582,618,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i  loved it for the most part but the way the main character acted the whole time kind of aggrovated me. the story wasnt bad i'd actually watch 100 more seasons if they existed..animiation was decent but not the best but better than alot of others. the sound was great except for the main charactershe was extremly aggrovating.the characters in general seemed well thought outand each had thier own uniqness. if the main character wasnt such a spaz it wouldve been rated a lot better.,30585,620,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY of Battle Girls reminded me greatly of InuYasha but I am a big enough history buff that I didn't care.  However do be warned - this is NOT a historical account.  After all a girl is going into the past so things are going to change.  I was originally irked that things that were suppose to occur didn't (in fact the OPPOSITE happened) but if you can get past that and focus on the fact it's not trying to be historically accurate it's a cute anime.,30600,621,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well even though I do like the manga of Tsubasa Chronicle and think it quiete got it's own personal charm and note. I never liked the anime adaption. Yes I dropped it. The adaption was kinda boring and ... well don't worry. I'm not gonna make a TC review lol. I'm just drifiting away. OK back to topic. That's the reason why it really took a while till I gave TC: TR a try. Thanks god to my fried who told me to do that lol.,30641,628,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I loved this anime so much (#6 on my top list).  Such brilliant fight scenes too.  Beautiful animation to go along with it.  Plus there are a lot of things to rant about.  Like the use of physics and the rift created by your typical catgirls (Blair Yoruichi Himari etc).,30647,630,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'll admit I was a little confused at some parts of the film but overall I thought it was very beautiful. There were many different themes shown that made you think very deeply while watching the film. It was the kind of film that I believe you would have to be in a certain mood for. You wouldn't want to be looking for something cheerful or chock full of romance. It's the kind of film that makes you reflect on certain aspects; such as peoples' ability to trust others and themselves. It was one of those films I would definitely watch again but not for a couple of years. It leaves that sort of an impact on you.,30673,645,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Being a drastically different take on the original series the movie improves on many elements as it retells the story in a more straight manner. While it doesn't have the length of a TV series to establish everything about the world and characters in depth it does a pretty good job non the less. Gorgeous animation and music will make even those unfamiliar with the original enjoy it as an exciting fantasy adventure.,30679,646,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Honestly I was a little bit disappointed with the movie. I thought that the movie would somehow be like a mini-sequel to what happened after the anime series even a prologue would've been better.,30686,647,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really liked this anime because it was so different from other ones it has some dark points and even some comedy which i really liked so i highly recomend this series if you want an action anime.,30694,648,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Pretear is a great magical girl anime to watch if you like fantasy and romance combined. The plot was pretty good too though I found it a bit predictable.

Adaptations are becoming a bit of a thorny issue in anime these days which is a bit odd considering how many are produced every year. The constant conversion of stories from other media is a pretty lucrative business as there's already an established market for the end product and its merchandise regardless of how good the show actually is. Like anything in life though there's a price to pay and there are increasing concerns about the impact adaptations are having on original works. The resulting negative effect on script and screen writers is beginning to be felt throughout the industry as studios everywhere are finding that their creative teams are slowly becoming unable to develop original concepts into viable storylines. The reason for this is purely because in comparative terms it takes more effort imagination and skill to make something original than it does to rework something that already exists and if one doesn't regularly exercise their  mental muscles  in a substantial manner then their creativity will begin to stagnate.,30762,677,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Where to start...well by the end of the first episode of Star Driver I had the feeling that this was trying to be something close to that of Gurren Lagann.  While this show may never actually attain that level it is still a fairly good anime especially for those viewers who are looking for the not so average mecha battle anime.,30763,678,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,30764,679,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The title translates to Star Driver: Takuto of the Radiance so right off the bat you know you're in for something camp and silly. If you can bypass that then you can't avoid the first episode's name Galactic Pretty Boy. You can't make this stuff up. And then Takuto goes on about he's going to lead a fabulous school life and we're not even at the five minute mark. It gets worse (Or better but more camp) but that lies in the  charm  of this farce.,30765,680,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Seitokai Yakuindomo is based on a crack yonkoma manga. Takatoshi Tsuda a student at a recently sexually integrated academy comes in his first day to school with his tie loose.

When I first heard of this anime I was skeptical of how a boring game of “Go” could have created 75 episodes. Shortly after 4 episodes I was addicted to seeing how the protagonist would grow in his conquest to become a professional “Go” player. The story was well executed each showing crucial lessons learned and hardship that goes into the life dedicated  Go  players must overcome. The emotional roller coasters that the characters go through in order to move up to the professional world of “Go” is heart wrenching and captivating. Not only is the story well-formed but the music that covers the many situations of non-dialogue grabs you into their games of “Go”. I high recommend watching this series if you enjoy anime with raw emotion and a beautiful soundtrack.,30777,685,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hikaru no Go is one of the few board game oriented animes you'll see and it is by far one of the best works my eyes have feasted upon. The plot summary is spot on sounds boring at first you'd have to run through about 5-10 episodes before you gain real interest in the anime's plot.,30796,691,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,30803,692,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story was entertaining. The main character is a bit stupid for my taste but most are. The unique thing is that he gets this side kick spirit from 1000 years ago that used to play go (and was one of the best if not the best of that time). He at first doesnt like go but then it grows on him and has to fight the 1000 year old spirit for playing time lol. This anime had some places where my adams apple wanted to pop out of my mouth and my heart went toki doki and i squirmed in my seat. Teared up like 2 times. Im a guy but i dont care. That shows that the anime was good.,30806,693,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime! This anime starts slow but is filled with entertainment! I suggest this anime to anyone who doesn't mind a silly anime as this one does not take itself seriously but it still makes for a fun entertaining anime. ,30812,694,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of those anime where you should realize what the rest of the series is going to be like after watching the first episode trust me plot takes more action during the second half but it's fundamentally the same. All in all I found it entertaining but lacking enough that it's just average. ,30813,695,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This had soo much potential but they repeatedly dropped the ball. Interesting plot devices and storylines were left unfinished or half done or half started or so convoluted that even info dumping would have been appreaciated.,30831,702,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you put aside the over the top perverted clumsy moments and exposure of body parts and random but frequent awkward moments this is a pretty decent anime.  The main character is a pretty believable reluctant hero/superpowered figure type.  I would like to say it is a classic type of character but I am not sure it totally fits but even if it doesn't it does come pretty close.  The other downside is the clunky cliched over the top beyond reasonable belief implied harem set ups hinted upon or even outright stated through out the anime.  This tiresome way way over used Japanese anime stereotypical cliche is soo boring trivial frequent and unrealistically portrayed that it more likely deters far more viewers than it attracts.  That out of the way and if possible removed entirely the show isn't half bad and shines in many ways as well.  You could almost classify it as a summoner series since one of the frequently used major powers involves summoning familars especially among the vampire crowd.  That is actually a fairly new spin to the classic vampire tale but perhaps in part inspired by their so called control over certain animals like guard dogs wolves bats and so on.  Another tiresome cliche seen is the child hood best friend even if she isn't right stated as such it is clear he has known her for a long time so the effect is the same in the end.  The main story is fairly fresh and filled with interesting characters background stories ingenious woven web connections across each other imaginative locations and steady character development.  What is right is very right even if not perfect but then few things are.  Though there are occasional gaps or unresolved aspects most of them are fairly minimal compared to most animes and even a few Western stories.  There are a few misses other than the ones expressly stated but related to them.  The way his observer interacts with him and curiously how fast she gets close and the way she does feels as unrealistic as the suggested harem deal.  Though her character has this giant flaw the rest of her character is pretty solid.  Other characters like the childhood best friend fade a bit too much into the background and is mostly relagated to tedious tasks but occasionally appearing important.  That is one of the big problems with juggling this cooky sloppy harem idea that so often appears in anime and manga they short change themselves on their freedom to fully develop characters and use them wisely through out the story.  Another good side is the action which is dramatically played out and choreographed pretty well with lots of flashy bustle explosions and use of magic.  I sum up the story as such it is a pretty good story with some originality a good hidden power type lead character some development of characters and social friendships but is dragged down mostly by over used cliches like the harem aspect.,30839,703,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was able to make me wanting to watch even more after each episode. The only problem I had in the anime was keeping up and trying to understand with all the names of the groups and organizations the people were in. Along with their purpose for coming to the island. Other than that if you're one of those go with the flow type of watchers this anime should be pretty good. So far this anime is on my favorites. Not the top favorite but if I come across with things that relate to this anime. I'll follow it.,30840,704,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While some parts of the story are admittedly cliche it isn't so bad that you can't get through them - and I must confess that some of the cheesy motifs ( iie senpai ) were pretty cute and amusing.,30842,705,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It was fun to see Toriko and Goku together but I find One Piece intolerable in general. My big gripe with this was how nerfed all the DBZ characters were but I guess there wouldn't be much contest with DBZ's overpowered characters otherwise.

Hi no Tori: Yamto Hen is a animated adaptation of Osamu Tezuka Phoenix manga Volume 3. I have not read the manga but from what I heard it is episodic and takes place in different points in time. Past and future. There is a Phoenix that legend has it if you drink it's blood you will gain immortality but no one has done this successfully. This story takes place in the far past. The main character Oguno from the Yamato people is wounded and cared by Kajika and her people the Kumaso. Their relationship builds. Oguno's original mission was to infiltrate the Kumaso tribe who are his people's (Yamato) enemy. One day he meets the Phoenix and the rest is for you to find out. The story is interesting. I loved the animation. I liked the character designs and it was a pretty looking 1980's anime. The sound was nice. The characters were good especially Oguno and Kajika. Kajika being my favorite. The story is tragic. That story might leave you with questions but these are things you can ponder about.,30865,715,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is the type of anime where it only becomes interesting later on. there are some technical stuff and political crap but i dont think its too much. romance wise is really very mild but seeing the characters grow is probably is best part. if there is a season 2 definitely will watch!,30893,725,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Villgust is a rather obscure anime OVA. Luckily it's also one of those obscure animes that happen to be very good. Based off a relatively unknown game for the Super Famicom this 1993 2-part epic follows two groups of heroes as they attempt to save their world Villgust from the evil deity Gavady. Only thing is these two factions are tricked into thinking that the other is their enemy and trouble ensues. The story is actually very exciting especially when the misunderstanding leaves their two strongest warriors in little condition to fight when things are at their worst.,30902,730,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai: Epilogue is surprisingly enough not an epilogue. There is no stand-alone value there is no knife-slicey fun but rather it starts with a long philosophical monolog continues as a philosophical monolog and finally ends with a short philosophical monolog. As far as philosophy goes this is not particularly deep but it is not worthless in itself since it somehow fits with the tone of the series.,30905,732,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This story really gets to you. There is a bunch of drama many crying scenes that makes you want to cry and there are hilarious scenes. Over all this show pulls at your heart strings then shatters it into pieces at the end(in a good way). The end finally made me want to cry and I did. I have never cried from a show or movie before until Anohana came around.,30914,738,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Anohana Review,30915,739,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AnoHana was one of those series that has been hovering on my recommendations list for a while.  I've had just about everybody tell me that it was one of the most heart wrenching series they had ever watched and that I would definitely like it.  In the end I was really torn about the result.  ,30916,740,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Dealing with the death of a friend or loved one isn't easy no matter how old you are and everyone comes to terms with their loss in different ways. Adults can drink themselves into a stupor in an effort to dull the pain take off on a journey of self discovery bury themselves in their work or find some other coping mechanism. Unfortunately the same isn't true for children and all too often they are unable to truly deal with the emotional turmoil that occurs.,30920,742,2019-04-13 21:35:40

     Anohana is without a doubt a gem of an anime. It manages to build up feelings right to the end which was flawless and not a let down like some similar animes. Both the opening and ending themes set are fairly gentle and suit the show well. The animation is smooth and beautiful. All the characters show great depth and personality. I cannot recommend this show enough.,30927,748,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story was good the animation was normal I wasnt amazed but i wasnt desapointed the sound was BEAUTIFUL and the characters were a bit bitchy. Overall 7.,30939,757,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just finished watching the last episode of AnoHana a couple hours ago and i'm still shocked by how wonderful this anime is. I admit that it has its flaws (they could've made better some details of the story and  a better character progression). ,30940,758,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Personally I liked this anime (except for the whole crying my eyes out at 2 a.m. in the morning thing). The story takes place with Jintan who is a shut in because of certain things in his past. When one day Menma appears (a deceased friend) and he seems to be the only one who sees her she claims that the only way she can go away (I did not mean this in a bad way) is if Jintan fulfills her wish. However the only problem is that she can not seem to remember what her wish is. Jintan then tries to get their old friends back together to help her out.,30941,759,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have to say This made me cry so hard. I is unbelievable. The sound track is STUNNING along with the animation all together. I downloaded the OST's and it helps me sleep at night. I recommend it.,30942,760,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I won't spoil any of the story. I really won't. It makes it hard to write a review and those who normally read my reviews will know I've got a hard time with not mentioning the plot or writing a short review like this one. Still I would like to keep it short. Not because it's a bad anime [those who know me know also I only write reviews of anime I give a 10/10] but because it's a good one. I think I don't need much words to tell how wonderful this one is. ,30952,765,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely loved this anime. Out of all the anime I have watched in the Slice of Life Side I feel like this impacted me the most. Especially since I cried 15 Times....which i consider a crazy amount for myself. I absolutely loved the character's and quickly grew attached to this anime. I watched this with my older brother on the 4th time I watched it and my brother cried from the First Episode..... he didnt even clearly know why like...the fact it made my brother cry He was like  10/5  and i thought that was halarious. Anyways I'm not gonna really go in depth or give any spoilers for this  review  I would say I'm doing a pretty half assed job at writing this but im just putting simple words of what i thought. I absolutely loved the opening for the anime I thought his voice was nostalgic. I can relate to this anime in so many ways and would recommend it to alot of people if they want a good anime to cry to ^_^,30953,766,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really enjoyed this anime. Somehow it just got to me. The storyline was sweet and really sad at points and the characters were really cute. I don't think I've ever cried that much during one anime. I'm glad I watched it and I will probably watch it again in the future.,30954,767,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have two favorite animes they are completely diferent and this is one of it. It's so beautiful so lovely and touching. I never cried so bad in my intire life watching something. This anime literaly made me cry for over an hour and a half and I only stopped because I felt sleep (yes it happened).,30955,768,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I understand that a lot of people really enjoy this anime yet still are unable to give it a full on 10/10 however I absolutley love it. I always look at the art style and story rather closely before even beginning watching an anime which means that everything I watch is pretty much guaranteed to be something I like. This makes the fact that AnoHana is something that stood out that much more impressive.,30957,769,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Let's face it the praise for this series is obvious in the number of people who gave this series a 10/10. The plotline is rather simple sometimes even obvious and cliche in its nature but the emotional attachment the series has forces the viewer to continue going on the search for Menma's wish and making it come true. If there is any rift I have with the series it was that the ending was inconclusive to the relationships the characters forced but rather very subjective (perhaps a second season will ensue?). It's a go easy series that quickly picks up and ferments itself in your heart. It's going to remain underrated when compared to the likes of series such as Madoka or Deadman Wonderland; however the easy going nature of this series is what makes it appealing. It also has one of the best OP's from the Spring 2011 lineup. A definite must-see for the avid anime fan.,30967,775,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay first off I would like to say thanks to the animators for such splending and heartmoving work.,30968,776,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the best anime of 2011 and will probably never be beaten I dont write many reviews but I do when I feel the need. This anime will make you laugh cry get frustrated mad pretty much any emotion you can think of. There are a lot of characters to connect to and scenerios. I Reccomend this anime to anyone who likes anime any kind. Ill write a real review soon but all i gotta say right now is,30969,777,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I completed this anime for today so my impressions are fresh and my rating can easily go down after a while. What can I say? After only one minute of watching I have already knew how this anime will end what situtations I shall see and what dilogues I shall hear that story from the past which means nothing will be told throughout the whole anime.,30971,779,2019-04-13 21:35:40

From the first episode I saw the potential in this anime and exceeded everything I could ask for in a 11~14 ep series. This anime is the greatest anime of Spring 2011.

The STORY of AnoHana follows hikikomori's Jintan who is now being followed by the ghost of his childhood Menma.  He along with their old friends has to restore a wish for her so that she can pass on to heave and leave them in peace; however when Menma returns so does a lot of old hurts and problems from the past and they find themselves in a whirlwind of selfish desires and secrets and growing up.,30983,790,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Before any of you read any further I have to say that this review is very biased of me; not because I love or hate any particular part of this anime but because it struck me on an extremely personal level. It is for that reason that I feel compelled to write this review even though I've never reviewed an anime before. For those of you who can't bear to hear my personal connections to this beautiful show the quick version is that I insist that it is a must-see especially for those who have lost a friend at a very young age.,30985,792,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When it comes to losing your loved ones in the past there can be little to no possibility that it can be fixed. There are minor mistakes and major mistakes. There are regrets that accumulates into grief that you can still remember. Back then I felt remorse for something.

Yes im probably went a little crazy with the 10's but i honestly feel this is one of the best anime's I have seen as far as series goes. This is an anime for those of us who enjoy our stories slow allowing us to get to know our characters and get attached to them. Throw in some awesome action scenes and some of the best music in an anime and you got a perfect series. For some people this series will be to slow for you but i encourage you to just keep watching it and by the end of the series you are going to want to watch it again. The ending is usually one of things that bothers me about a lot of animes but in this one the ending is just perfect.,31004,803,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Short and sweet cause 1. I'm not one for writing reviews 2. I'm lazy and don't feel like typing a 3000 word essay. My take on the anime: The ending was really rushed (kinda anti-climatic) the series would have benifited if it had been exteneded there were a lot of things that were rushed story wise the action scenes are really mostly just pictures with that speed lines effect added left out a few things unanswered. Apart from that I believe it has a good story (even if it was rushed) and the characters were descent enough (even though they ultimately have the same background story). I give 6/10 overall (maybe 5/10) it's not unbearable otherwise I would have dropped it.,31015,809,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Yeah the second season of FMP! the one that takes out the espionagend giant robots and replaces them with silly romance and giant bearuits. It's goofy its witty it's got Tessa in a sailor uniform.,31020,814,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu is a spin off of the original FMP series. The whole series this time around takes place mostly in the school so you get to see how Sasuke deals with school life which can create some very funny moments. I thought the series was very enjoyable and was by far the funniest anime show I've watched. The downside of this series is that it contains much less action and follows no real storyline. The comedy makes up for it big time though. This is the kind of series that even if you didn't see the past one you would still enjoy it since the episodes don't really reflect on that and are more based on the comedy aspect. The number of episodes is good also so you won't get bored of watching too many.,31033,815,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So to my surprise I didn't enjoy Full Metal Pani? Fumoffu as much as I'd hoped.  Somehow the initial season's foray into school life seemed so full of excitement and opportunity that I had tricked myself into believing that a whole season of such antics would be hillarious.  *sigh*,31043,818,2019-04-13 21:35:40

From Studio Trigger the guys that brought you that overrated show about girls with magical thongs comes an internet series with worse animation and production values than half of the Sonic the Hedgehog porn on Newgrounds. It’s Ninja Slayer and boy is it a visual and auditory feast! Actually the opening isn’t that bad aside from some terrible Engrish. I didn’t watch the ending because by that time I was too busy deleting this virus of a file from my computer to care.,31051,823,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a very tongue in cheek anime.  YEEART!  The visual style lends itself to the humor.  YEEART!  I find it very reminiscent of an adult swim cartoon (ATHF for example).  YEEART! The sound direction is excellent featuring a new outro song for each episode.  YEEART!  The character designs are all very interesting even if their motivations are not.  YEEART!  While seeking revenge for your murdered family is not the most feminist--nor original--of plots the show does feature strong female characters.  YEEART!  If you are not laughing throughout the first episode this anime may not be for you! YEEART!,31055,826,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Uchikomatic days is a rather interesting look on how the Uchikomas feel when they are compared to the Tachikomas.,31057,828,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story - I liked this one because the romance started early and got right into it instead of waiting till the final 5 minutes of the last episode like most do. The two start their relationship early and you watch it develop for the first two episodes. After that... well it sucked. Not that the show sucked. Just the idea at the end of the second episode sucked. My only thought was  thats a shame . I was mad but I kept watching. The rest of the show had a depressing feel to it but it added to the drama. There were a lot of little things that made me keep watching like wondering how it would end. At first you hate the dicisons some of the characters make but you have to get over it when you realize it's nobodies fault with what is happening. The only people I can really blame for all the drama in the middle of the series are Haruka's parents. But they were only being good parents. So basically everyone was just really unlucky. Not sure I wanted it to end the way end did but I can't find a better solution so I'll just stick with it. A great story. I just wish they could of left out some of the depression. I would of liked if maybe it was just a love triangle without anyone getting physically hurt and not taking us to three years later.,31064,829,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was one of the more powerfully moving anime i've watched in a while. I'm not great at reviews but i can say it's right up there with Clannad as far as the emotion it invokes.,31065,830,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story although brilliant was rather depressing. Yes it had all the features of a romance yet the way in which it ended was disappointing. During the first two episodes the story was full of humour and excitement and it really drew in the audience yet afterwards it seemed that it was one tradgedy after another for the main characters. It is not to be expected that all plots end in the most desirable fashion as that would be boring yet the conclusion appeared to be lacking in many aspects. As for character development some of them were just  there.  They existed and nothing about them changed. Again it is to be expected that not all characters will develop although it would be preferred when they are involved in the plot in such an in depth manner. ,31071,833,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was one of those animes that when you watch it to the end for the first time you keep thinking about it the next day(maybe its just me). I really enjoy this series because it was playing with my emotions. Sometimes I was almost feeling what the characters were feeling. There were plenty of sad moments and plenty of those  WTF...  moments where I don't understand why certain characters would behave like that. Slightly overdramatic would be the key word for it. The story was engaging and constantly pulled me to the next episode to find out what was going to happen. The ending was definately one of the most effective ones I have seen in the genre so far. The ending satisfied me (this depends on the people of their view of what should have been but i'll leave it at that.),31072,834,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Literally forced myself to finish this... I will start by saying that this is an older show so obviously i don't expect amazing animation or anything but for the most part fights are pretty much the same thing.  They recycle a lot of battle animation and its kind of just the gundams taking on waves of other generic mobile suits.  I think that the part that annoyed me the most was that they were coming out with a new model literally every three episodes.  I mean it just got ridiculous that they could build such vastly superior gundams to what they had been doing in what seems like no time.  The plot got very draggy for me by episode like 27 ish and i really have forced myself through the rest.  It picked up again by the late 30's and to the end but following the motivation for the gundam piolets and trying to figure out who they were actually fighting for was a challenge for me at times.,31107,844,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A quickie review for a quickie music video: This violent and abstract short features a hero masked characters robots and automatons and lots of violence.  All set to an industrial electronica beat.  Mother-figure automatons walk the streets carrying knives children carry guns to protect themselves blood is spilt often and randomly.  The cityscape has a post-apocalyptic feel and the visuals are surreal and creepy. Yet there -is- hope. Also flying around the environs is a begoggled hero riding a rocket who offers hope of being the one who can arrive to save the day.,31117,851,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's no wonder that Koi Koi 7 was never licensed - this one stinks to high heaven. In fact it's so bad that not even the fansub groups would tackle the last three episodes. Basically we have two sets of harems fighting over one guy. The whole plot was completely unbelievable. (Example: How many women do you know that will share a room and get naked in front of a guy they just met?) The villians give you a lot to hate about them but so do the heroes as well. ,31135,857,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm writing this review just to say - don't be deceived by the first couple episodes. The show gets a lot better after a kind of awkward start and you'll be glad you stuck through. It's by no means a perfect anime but it's highly entertaining and very conducive to binge watching - the show creators really know how to leave you wanting more at the end of an episode.,31156,867,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sailor Moon was one of the first anime's I have started watching back when it aired on Cartoon Network during the Toonami days (i miss Toonami). It was what really got me into anime and it really helped me in a way and inspired me to treasure my friends and loved ones and to always be there for others when needed. Sailor Moon will always have a special place in my heart because of that.,31164,871,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sailor Moon was by far one of the oddest anime I've ever watched. Well here goes. I really liked this anime. I actuallt used to hate it (I was watching the old dub and didn't know any better). After seeing the horrid Cartoon Network version that made 4kids One Piece look like gold it made me get the hell out of dodge. But a few years later I gave it another chance when it was redubbed in 2014 and I liked it. It really had a likable protagonist (despite her utter lack of courage... and brains). The story was really well paced and it gave every main character a proper introduction and backstory. The main villain really surprised me I initially thought she was boring and worthless but after seeing why she was doing what she was doing I really admired her as a villain. ,31165,872,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To the majority of all Anime fans whether Sailor Moon is good enough to charm a little girl off her feet or appeal to an older audience seeking nostalgia is a question of utter irrelevance. What most people should be asking themselves is whether or not it can actually appeal to a male or adult audience and after having seen all 46 episodes I'm pretty sure that it can. Now I do admit that I used to watch this as a child but the only parts of it I could remember before I re-visited it were the transformation sequences Sailor Mars and the Swedish dub of the ending theme. All in all this was a fairly pleasant viewing experience.,31166,873,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm a sucker for Sailor Moon. It genuinely is the first anime I ever watched because the dub was on very early on Saturday mornings when I was a small child. I can still remember watching it at least 10 years on. I suppose I have to thank Sailor Moon for getting me into anime. Even though it was made before I was born I still 'connected' with the characters in the way they were designed to - especially the costumes. As a blonde haired blue eyed child it was my ambition (for about two weeks) to become Sailor Moon!,31168,874,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In 2011 Japan celebrated the 20th anniversary of the classic Sailor Moon manga by Takeuchi Naoko.

I give it an 5/10 because I think the story line had good potential to become something awesome. But I hate the fact that there are only 13 episodes and the fights were weak for her to be the grandaughter a famous clan head... She had a scary oura about her though which was most of the comedy! And if you watch it you notice there is a potential love triangle in there too. Like I said great story line but the direction they went in was kind of predicted and bland. Even though I finished every episode in one day... It was pretty enjoyable :D,31234,893,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Seto no Hanayome has grown to be one of my favourite anime over the years. This is mainly to the fact that music has a large part in it along with songs and great humor.

Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk is a 12 episode fantasy action anime set in an RPG-like medieval world featuring a little comedy here and there. This is one of those anime whose 1st episode is not representative of the whole series. And it also has a sequel suggesting the story is incomplete. It’s slow to get going it doesn’t really start till the 4th episode. Can such an anime redeem itself? One thing is for sure the intro doesn’t seem fully representative of this anime.

Definitely my favorite romance genre anime this is also my review for Rosario Vampire 1 & 2.,31309,926,2019-04-13 21:35:40
By this time the story has strayed so far from the source it can hardly be called the same thing.  Though it does albiet very very vaguely finally suggest some changes to Tskune near the end and that he can face some things on his own it is very much too little too late and a very weak and poor attempt at that.  It is so vague and weakly done it is hard to really know what the heck is going on.  Yet since it strays so much from the source and so poorly at that it seems like the story arcs have no real footing.  The second season centers too much around this silly harem idea and does so way more strongly than the manga.  It makes the girls in the series seem foolish weak stupid and/or desparate.  Maybe the series writers by this time either all left or were themselves so fed up that they just driveled on standard manufactured cliches to fill the script pages.  Most of the episodes are pretty weak compared to even to season one and also seem to go no where.  it is even hard to really understand or find any story arcs like there were in season one and the manga.  The stupid bat seems to take on a stronger more central role and he does not even exist in the manga and in season one he is mostly just a narrator.  Either role is way better than as a central character.  There is really no meaning or meat or substance anywhere in season 2.  It is almost a hack job rip off of the ruined mess that season one was.  For the most part there are really no story arcs in common with the manga from season two though there is some vague though they are resemblences to the story arcs in the manga to season one.  Season one might have been a failed half hearted underskilled effort to retell the manga but season two doesn't even measure up to that.,31310,927,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Awesome beginning to such a wonderful show. I note to watch these 2 OVAs before the full show so you have some slight background. The first OVA is about Ritsu our protagonist and Saga who you find out later in the show is still around. The second story is about Tori and Chiaki and it's a little more straightforward than the first. Both stories give you an intro or prequel to the show and both of which hooked me right away. I preferred the first to the second but still I love all of these characters now that I've watched everything as a whole. Animation and Characters along with what I think of the Sound are all reviewed in detail on my review of the full show as this did not have an opening theme.,31331,935,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is going on my favourites list,31361,940,2019-04-13 21:35:40
 I picked this one out because I wanted to find a yuri for my friend and I to watch since I was interested to see how the genre played out as was she. This was well...kinda ridiculous. There really isn't a plot it's really just cute girls doing cute girl things and that really grates on my nerves pretty easily. ,31362,941,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was very impressed when I started watching Baccano and even though I've bailed on the series I'm still impressed with it. It's quite imaginative the 1930s-era look is well done it's well paced and the story is intriguing.,31368,942,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Baccano is such a masterpiece. The story flows as if people are pulling out random newspaper clips from a file but they flow so well together your just waiting for the next episode to come along and explain what will happen next and if your characters will live or die or be brought back from the dead! this is such a good thriller and i love the attention to detail they have for all the music being mostly done on sax and they have Tommies and its just amazing to see. I totally recommend it to anyone who likes good thrillers with the italian / american mafia aspect.,31369,943,2019-04-13 21:35:40

IT is best advisable to start watching the series from the very beginning as each episode tends to jump from the present to the future and from a character's POV from the other. Although it would still be understandable especially you get on with things pretty easily.,31380,950,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you are looking for a great series look no further than Baccano!  This is definitely one of the better series I've recently seen.  It set in the 1920's and the music (which is really catchy) reflects this beautifully.  The animation is crisp and beautiful as well.  Finally I must say that the characters and the story of this series really shine.  The story is very disjointed jumping between several years several times an episode but this is done surprisingly well.  The characters have a similar situation:  There are more characters for this series than there are episodes yet they all end up well fleshed out.  All and all if you can handle a small amount of gore then I highly recommend that you pick this show up.,31414,962,2019-04-13 21:35:40

After watching Durarara!!  wanted to get in to the Light Novels. I've only read a few so far but I'm already in love with Narita's work. So of course I had to get in to Baccano! starting off with the anime.,31418,964,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,31422,965,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Baccano! is one of those anime that leaves you breathless when you finish it. Many people consider it a masterpiece and I can agree on that. It's extremely complicated because it connects 3 different storylines which seem unrelated but in truth are closely connected. A main character doesn't exist here; there are more than 15 characters who serve as protagonists. Suprisingly enough this doesn't make Baccano! suffocating; in fact this is one of its best qualities.,31424,966,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I realize I'm long overdue for another review but I've beenatching fewer anime recently in preparation for the relatively weakinter release schedule. I promise I'm here to make up for it with anstounding new title Baccano! Place your bets folks this is going toe a bumpy ride!,31426,967,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY of Baccano! is an interesting mix of many people's lives being connected by the same ingredient: a potion that makes whoever drinks it immortal.  The plot follows through 1931 1932 and 1933 in New York on a train called  The Flying Pussyfoot  where the viewer is already prepared for something ominous to happen due to a prediction in the beginning of the series.  What occurs is a fun and sometimes disturbing mix of idiocy violence and humor.,31427,968,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Straight up this is a mish mash of genres: crime comedy drama suspense action and probably a few more. Something for nearly everybody and all those ingredients in the end form a decadent cake that may be brief but tastes delicious. The ambient jazz goes perfectly for your meal but more on that later.,31430,969,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Oh the 1930's a simpler time where travel was conducted via steam engine and a majority of the people around could be brutally murdered and then just pop back to life.,31433,970,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:  This anime has the most unique plot with so much detail.  Some people may cite characters as being one of the shows weak points (I disagree on this point) but its mostly because the show is more about the story than the characters.  The characters mostly exist as puzzle pieces to put together an intricate plot.  Ultimately we have about eleven people that might be the main characters.  Over a period of alternating years between the late 1920's and early 1930's the characters unravel a massive secret to events occurring in 1711.  I will admit this is an anime you have to pay attention to and be willing to contemplate.  If you want something that is purely about action... this won't be your anime.  The years skip around fast and you have to keep track of which year you’re in.  All the scenes either tell you the year or give you enough hints to conclude the year.  My advice when watching this anime is to be prepared to keep track of years. ,31436,971,2019-04-13 21:35:40

An anime set in 1930s America? Sign me up! Baccano is told in a non linear format (meaning events are told out of order) but you get used to it very quickly. The plot revolvs around many people whose stories seem unrelated but get entangled as the show progresses. The soundtrack is the halmark of the show. Jazz music gives us the feel of the Jazz Era the occured during the early 30s. The settings for the anime are also amazing! It really seemed as if the animators did their research on New York City during the time period. Any problems I had with the show where mainly due to the design of the costumes which for the most part where mainly accurate with some inacuracies. I also felt as if the gore was a bit over the top however I feel like the writers had an American audiance in mind. ,31440,973,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When you happen to stumble onto something amazing something that fits your taste so much it's weird that thing becomes rather memorable. This one anime happened to be that thing for me. It has gangsters a theme that i enjoy way to much. 1930s theme a period that I love and adore. Psychopathic killers something I find interesting in anime and tv shows. And it has badassness something everybody loves to love. This is Baccano.,31445,975,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Severaluestions one could have after watching this show: who are the villains? What definesvil? Or more likely: why can’t all action shows be like this?!,31448,976,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I...LOVE BACCANO!!! It has everything i love!! funny and interesting characters that draw you in wonderful writing attention to detail for a historical anime and fast paced action and suspense! I love how they flow all three different timelines together almost like they were randomly pulling out different newspaper clippings from those timelines! I know it doesn't sound like it fits but IT DOES!!! All the characters get a chance to shine and you find bits and pieces about them. Baccano Has to be the best underrated anime out there!! more people Must know of this Masterpiece!!,31452,978,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Baccano is a 12 episode action seinen anime set in 1930’s America. The narrative of this anime reminded me of the Tarantino movie Pulp Fiction. It’s non-linear and follows a variety of characters each with their own individual stories that converge at one disaster of an event on the Flying Pussyfoot train during a cross-continental journey across America. My prior expectations were low I didn’t think much could come out of a simple train journey but the intro alone got me excited. And soon I realised what a masterpiece of an anime this is.,31491,992,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Beautifully well written and protrayed in the limited time this anime was given. the story focuses around a girl who when young gets lost in a forest and meets a friendly mountain  spirit  named Gin. I thought the story line was very thought out and detailed. My only concern was the somewhat rushed ending. Considering it is so short it is somewhat expected however. I thought the animation style was farely decent but I thought it could have had slight improvements like the smoothness of faces or the overall flow of the enviroment. I thought the voice actors and character design were very thoughtful. The voices were just how I'd like them to be and the character's stories were detailed in between the lines. One of my favourite animes in general and my favourite short anime.,31551,19,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's pretty common to get the sensation of feeling like you care for the characters in an anime spanning 20 episodes or more. It's rare to come across a 12 or 13 episode anime that gives you that sensation. It's possibly the rarest of them all to accomplish a liking and a genuine care for the characters in 45 minutes. Hotarubi no Mori e is that prized gemstone.,31561,25,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a bitter sweet short film about a coming of age love that was fated by sadness from the onset. Despit this the film portrays the love between Gin and Hotaru in an innocent and meaningful way.

Before I watched this I didn't think a 45 minute movie could reduce me to tears. But yeah seems like this managed to do the trick. One reason that I really liked this movie was because I was able to get attatched to it in such a short amount of time. Since I've seen many TV series I'm used to the story taking a long time to build and grow so I get slowly get attatched to it. But this movie managed to get me attatched super fast even though it felt really simple.,31575,32,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This film broke my heart... in a good way i guess it is films like this that make me love anime. To be able to produce such emotion in to something animated is a gift in its self but this film manages in 45 minutes to make me smile laugh and cry. A very beautiful story. A box of tissues is definately needed for this one.,31581,35,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I wanna know more yet at the same time I don't wanna—I can't make up my mind honestly. But one certainty is that I'm still in awe of the movie. It's unlike anything I've ever watched before. Heartfelt carefree yet so much deep feelings. Amazing characters really heartfelt setting and a story that's relatable to real life in aspects like friendship time but most especially love. Omighad amma gonna continue my feels in my room now.,31585,39,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's short anime movie. It's pretty awesome that in only 40 minutes you actually can meet the characters and better know they story.,31586,40,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was a fairly good anime. I like this anime because it had a good story line to it. What confused me was that the one main character going back in time. However it is still really good. I like the animation of the anime because it is good. This anime also had good setup of the coflicts however the resolutions might have need just a little more work to them. The characters of this anime had very good details to them as well as the scenary. I like the music in this anime because the songs did not over power the voices of the characters. I also like the voices of some of the characters. The characters of this anime where well developed. There was also good  relationship  development between some of the characters.,31587,41,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I’m having bit of difficulty rating this one properly. On one hand it was very prettytylish and had a good fairly creative storyline and characters. On the otherand at times the style felt a bit overdone (like in the first still-frame-screamn episode one) and some of the characters felt incredibly shallow in comparisono an otherwise great cast.,31604,48,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The main protagonist is sooooo annoying. He sounds retarded. The plotline is interesting and that was the only reasoning I made it to episode 8 but in the end I still couldn't take akito's retardedness. The writers overemphasizes his problems. I didn't feel sorry for him one bit because the writers couldn't draw out a convincing character or argument.,31617,52,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For those of you who don’t know this is a show that was created by the same manga-ka that created Ranma ½ Inuyasha and Lum. I had actually never known of this show until I was just glimpsing at a list of dubbed anime. Having said this the show is a bit odd in comparing it to the shows she normally does.,31633,59,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story: On the surface this is a story about a man who has been wandering for 500 years because he ate mermaid flesh and became immortal. Under that are varying snapshots of humanity and how people deal with the temptation of extended life. The anime is episodic with each story taking up two episodes at most. It allows for character development of Yuta but not many other characters in my opinion. While the anime is listed as a horror genre the horror is in the slow building way that Japan seems to love. ,31634,60,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The  horror  genre in anime has pretty much become a misnomer over theears; rather than attempting to be scary in any way shape or formhe animes almost always attempt to develop a slow interesting andruesome story. When the genre works well it fosters a kind of morbidascination in the viewer. Despite the fact that not a lot is happeningn these shows what does happen can be very interesting indeed.owever when the genre fails the anime comes across as cheesyredictable and boring. Every horror anime walks a very fine lineetween being appealingly dark and appallingly absurd and when annime crosses into the ridiculous much of its charm is lost.,31636,61,2019-04-13 21:35:40

BPS is one of those shows you watch and find strangely compelling but also disappointing at the same time. Either way I do and would recommend it for certain people. Not everyone mind you but for some it may be a quick and fun romp through something a bit different.,31643,68,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,31662,75,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It was a great show lots of drama highly suggested to drama-lovers out there. It was an OK show until maybe episode 9-10 which is when it looks like someone else started writing the storyline. I absolutly hated the ending. NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHATSOEVER! basically if the show had a better ending and was maybe 24 episodes long it would be a 9.5 but how the show abruptly stops in a strange ending just dissapointes me. I Recommend quickly starting another anime quickly after you finish it. But overall i cant say it was a TOTAL waste of time. it was still an enjoyable show. Somewhat.,31665,76,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"This show could have concluded in 4 episodes. Be prepared for mostly pointless dialogue alongside minor characters and events. Very funny at times but I frequently found that it was supposed to be funny and yet didn't succeed. Frankly I was bored a lot until the last three episodes when the plot actually came about. The ending is  okay  and let's just say  interesting . There wasn't much character development but some revelations come about towards the end. I left the sound rating blank because I wasn't sure what my oppinion is about it. I guess the music was fitting for the feel of the show. ",31667,77,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Throughtout the anime it is hinted that Minato and Jun have feelings for one another however I was truly upset when I found out that they really did end up together at the end; especially since in the manga Yuuhi and Jun end up together instead. Great animation but the story just blew it for me. Had to stop watching at episode five.,31669,79,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Ok... very first of all.... the Whole anime story was ok.... but the ending? What the hell with all that incest? Its not right its not good.... ok its good (for pervs) (like me ^^ (the good side the good side) but still......alright... ",31670,80,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well I have read the other reviews and I kinda agree but this anime has a certian psycholgical weridness to it but even so the characters are very funny yet deciving and the plot kinda dull down but then picks up an second season would totally kill it but the story started out funny then the kiss of death just plop and a lot of stuff doesnt get answered but you might figure that out and the Ehh Emm insectual ending well killed the plot so I guess that is what everyone else was talking about I might agree slightly with someone who said only watch up to ep.10 but all in all it was an OK anime I would recomend it to anyone who just wants to sit back and laugh for a bit,31672,81,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Akane-Iro had the potential to be a 'cute' little series and having watched the first 11 episodes in a sitting I found it quite enjoyable. Unfortunately theres always a 'but'... That 'but' happens to be episode 11 the 'coming about' of the plot episode as it were. It was heavily disappointing to say the least and left me wanting the last 3 hours or so of my life back. I have no desire to watch the final episode now (already know what happens) and for anyone else wanting to watch this series (that i do recommend up to a certain point by the way) I suggest watching up to episode 10 and stopping. At which point of course you are required to make up your own ending to this cute little story which of course could only be better then the actual ending. *HINT* Think along the lines of cute and fuzzy not unreasonable incest and absolute nonsensical story writing (unnecessarily thrown into and thus ruining the series for no other apparent purpose other then to showcase the writers oddness). Otherwise though enjoy!,31673,82,2019-04-13 21:35:40

for me i liked the beginning it was fun entertaining but as it went on well for me i lost interest it became a bit dull theres wasnt the same feeling as before even the story lacked energy and excitement and other stuff too. i believe that this anime really was a bit dull and boring it began strong but lost its touch along the way there was a point in the anime i just wanted to skip the episodes because i was bored off them but since i was atleast more than half way i decided to continue and the ending. well its up to you if you want to watch i say see the first episodes then decided...,31680,87,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I like reading yaoi fanfiction than yaoi manga or watching yaoi anime but I'll give you my honest review.,31685,89,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime perfectly placates my inner yaoi fangirl. I do admit that I have watched it more than once and that it did lead me to watch other shounen-ai genre anime. I was absorbed enough by the plot to overlook the at times annoying characters and the sex scenes were remarkably un-graphic (especially when compared to the manga which is pretty explicit). I liked the Misaki/Usagi couple best but the other two were more annoying. I kept shouting at Hiroki to dump Nowaki but I didn't really like either character. Also the ambiguous sexuality of every single character was a little bizarre: characters like Usagi and Shinobu were clearly gay but every other character kind of pondered it for a very long time before finally giving in to their designated other's advances but not necessarily admitting their attraction to men.,31686,90,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Junjou Romantica,31687,91,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a super good anime. I just love the story line to this anime because it is super good and the plot of the anime is well played out. I like that for each of the couples that they have there own main goal to get over. How ever I do not really like that almost every other episode that it is about a different it gets hard to keep up with what is happaning but do not get me wrong this is still a good anime. I love the animation of this anime it is really good. The characters and the secenary both have really good details. I love the sound in this anime. I just love the opening and ending songs they are so good. I also love that the songs trough out the anime do not over power the characters voices. I love the voices of some of the characters because they are really awesome and I also find some of the voices are a little bit sexy. I love almost all of the characters because they are really awesome people. I love what they coupoles are willing to do for the person they love no matter the cost to them selves. So over all this is a really good anime and if you love Yaoi at all then you will so like this anime.,31688,92,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is totally the best Shouen-ai show. It has great characters that you have to love. You really want them to be happy and the world just keeps getting in their way. Even if you don't like boy-on-boy if you give this a chance you end up changing your mind because this shows pulls at your heart and will make you believe in love and destiny. It shows you that even if you loss someone you loved there is always someone else who may come alone who you can find happiness with. It also shows that even if things seem to fall apart or have no structure everything does come into place and happen for a reason. This show is very addicting and you will be caring about the characters constantly. Each character is totally unique to the others on the show but they all have a tie into each other showing that what you do can effect others. Anyway I think this show was amazing and is really worth the watch! ,31689,93,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My favorite soft-core yaoi of all time! The stories are all so cute. They all have problems to overcome but their steamy make-ups are amazing. <3 I would recomend this to ANYONE who likes guyXguy.,31690,94,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Im a male that tried this out of curiosity and mostly cus my females friends who love anime recomended this with high praise. If they didn't make out and have sex almost every episode i would of liked it more but for what it is as a malethe romance feels real and different from the typical male - female romance. I definitely recomended this.Episode 6 made me cry real bad.The music at timesthe pacing at certain scenesthe intricateunique and intresting characters i love all these things.If are an true anime fan you will recognize this for its authenticityi wish all romantic anime took this much time on character background..,31691,95,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi I was feiending for another lovely yaoi. I liked Studio Deen so I figured id stay with them and watch another of their most popular. I was pleased with this show and also a bit disappointed because the characters weren't as good in this one. I think maybe my expectations were too high. This is not to say it was bad at all in fact it was quite good but judging it agains S.I.H. I much prefer that one.,31692,96,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Junjou Romantica... Ah how can one describe a peice of work that is so perfectly horrid yet disgustingly satisfying? Well let me put it this way; the whole thing is utterly ridiculous. At every turn there's an 18-year-old boy crying an intense deep-voiced man pinning some helpless college student to the wall or ground an obnoxious shout of 'baka' followed immediately by the slamming of a door student/teacher crushes awkward silences boy's love novelists stoic smokers and coffee drinkers who happen to like giant teddy bears and more!

Sora no method is a story about a group of 6 kids and their friendship. The protagonist is a girl called Nonoka who after an absence of 7 years goes back with her father to the town where she had lived previously. Hovering over this particular town is a giant alien saucer which has been hanging there in the sky for (surprise surprise) 7 years. Nonoka has just sketchy memories of the time she lived there as a little girl but when she gets back she re-acquaints herself with her old friends and slowly her memories start getting clearer. Everything revolves around the saucer in the sky and the cute little girl called Noel who seems to have some mysterious link to the saucer and to the 5 kids.,31736,115,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overview,31771,137,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Of every anime series i have ever watched this has been by far the most unique one. It was amazing how they were able to combine sci-fi into daily life.  One of the best aspects of the series in my opinion was how Haruhi was god but did not know herself.  Things happened because she wanted them to.  The series also provides a good laugh when one is needed especially the countless times Kyon walks in on Mikuru.  Yuki is by far literally the most kick-ass character of them all somethingg no one saw coming it was amazing the way she took down Ryoko. Mikuru's innocence is something that is setting her up to be sexually harassed by Haruhi especially after her saying early in the series that she would be with anyone regardless of gender as long as they weren't an ordinary human. A few simple thoughts to sum up my thoughts:,31772,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I finished this one a while ago.  It wasn't too bad but was just so boreing and I actually found Lucky Star to be somewhat exciting in a boring way if that makes any sense.,31777,139,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Alright before I go into detail allow me to say one thing: This anime is not  my cup of tea.  However I do see why a lot of people like it.  There's A LOT of good in this show.  My problems come from where it feels flawed cheap or rushed which it sadly does.  However the animation is absolutely spectacular the music is great and fitting and there are a lot of jokes in it that I find incredibly funny.  While I don't think it's as spectacular as a lot of people make it out to be there is a clear sign that a lot of effort went into this show even if it didn't come out as a masterpiece.  So without further ado let's dive into The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzymia.,31788,142,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of Haruhi the first time I heard my room-mate getting frusturated by the second season of the show (the Endless Eight in particular).  Curious I decided to watch it and havent regretted a second since.  The show's concept that a 'normal' high school student (Haruhi Suzumiya) with unknown god-like powers is interesting in of itself but what was more interesting to me was the narration of this series.  Told by the skeptic and associate of Haruhi's Kyon I was plesently suprised with how well the story is told from his perspective especially in regards to the discovery of supernatural events and the efforts the SOS Brigade undergoes to keep it a secret from Haruhi.  This show is definately one of if not my favorite Anime currently and with two superb seasons and a fantastic film why shouldnt it be!,31797,146,2019-04-13 21:35:40

NOTE: This review is based on the 2006 airing of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Do not confuse this with the 2009 Rebroadcasting of Season 1 that was aired with new episode thrown in,31827,154,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story is not bad. The animation the music the dances they are all professionally done. However there are other more important (to me) aspects of the series that annoy me so much I can never watch more than an episode in one sitting.,31829,155,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When I when to watch The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya I unwittingly began to watch it in the order it was broadcasted now for those who don’t know the broadcasted order is not linear so I had a wft moment after I watched it because the first episode in the broadcasted order is actually the 11th one in the chronological order. Lucky I decided to watch the second episode which is actually the first episode in chronologically and it made more sense to me. So for those of you who are watching it for the first time make sure you watch it in chronological order it makes a whole lot more sense.,31830,156,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved it I really liked how there was some fantasy into the anime I've always been interested in aliens and espurs so this is really entertaining. I reccomend it. Cool anime,31831,157,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Ok. There's rarely a time when I give a series all 10/10s. I usually find something that I don't necessarily like or agree with and I'm ok with that. But this one really fit me. It's only 14 episodes long but if you by the 2nd season it's considerably longer. (The events of season 2 take place within the same school year and you actually watch a lot of the episodes in between episodes of season one to see the entire thing.) It sounds confusing because it is. The only thing is it doesn't take away from the series in the least bit. ",31833,159,2019-04-13 21:35:40

STORY:,31848,164,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I liked the story line to this anime. I like how it flowed nicely form the previous seires. What I like about the story line is that the main characters are trying to fulfill one main goal in thier life. The animation of this anime is really good. I like the details in the characters and also the details in the scenary. This anime has very good theme songs such as the opening song and some of the ending songs. I also love some of the battle songs which in my opinion do not drown out the characters voices. I love most of the characters in this anime but there are some characters that I really want to die because they really piss me off. But overall this is a fairly good anime.,31851,165,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Now I'm not usually a guy who likes romantic animes but what made this show stand out to me was how honest it was about sex up front which just made me like and laugh at the show. Having the protagonist be the sex crazed female for once was also refreshing.,31880,177,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's not everyday that you run into an anime where that instead of the guy being the prevert it's the girl that turns out to be the prevert.  Which of course is exactly what you get in B Gata H Kei.,31890,183,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Absolutely hilarious I had a permanent smile on my face the entire series. A really mellow story and all of the characters were quite diverse and likeable. A bit of a role reversal from the usual loser male trying to lose his virginity which I really enjoyed.,31892,184,2019-04-13 21:35:40

B Gata H Kei or as I like to call it  B  (cup) Gata H(ave sex) Kei?  is likely the weirdest sex comedy anime. There aren't very many sex comedy anime unsurprisingly enough but I digress. This show is easily my favorite comedic anime.,31898,187,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story is a bit ridiculous and the plot just keeps getting weirder and weirder with stuff that I just couldn't take seriously.  However comedy isn't really meant to be taken seriously IMO.  The animation is really amazing but looks great.  Characters are basically the stereotypical people you'd think of in an ecchi series.  There's the perv the reasonable friend and the oblivious victim.  Overall good dirty humor IMO.  It's not too much but knows it's not for kids.,31904,189,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series is 12 episodes which i think is near perfect amount. Any more and the story would have dragged on. Tekashi and Yamada are on a mission to lose their virginity but apparently they get cockblocked every chance they get. As the story goes Yamada has a goal to have 100 sex buddies. This idea for an anime is quite unique and i thought it was told fairly well. The majority of episodes consist of Yamada trying to get into Tekashi's pants but the viewer finds out that she is a tsundere. Yes she makes situations more difficult by showing mixed emotions or blantly avoiding Tekashi. An odd concept if you ask me because why is she avoiding her initial goal?,31919,196,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When watching Seitokai Yakuindomo when I first got into Anime this series kept popping up everywhere. Facebook the recommendation section people talking about it.

Normally I don't like fan service in anime. It usually feels random and detracts from the plot. B Gata H Kei uses fan service in the best way possible: as part of a sexually charged story where sexuality is the theme plot and desires of all the characters. After watching this anime I feel the best way to describe it is as a reverse Green Green loaded with sexuality and humor and all the more enjoyable for it. It also manages to include a rather sweet romance amongst all this fan service and humor.,31925,199,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,31926,200,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY of B Gata H Kei follows fifteen year old Yamada who is determined to have 100 'sex buddies'; however there is one problem - she has to lose her virginity first.  The audience follows Yamada's humorous attempts as she picks an Average Joe named Kosuda to be her first encounter.  Although the premise does sound creepy the overall story is sweet - not to mention hilarious.,31927,201,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I just binge-watched the whole series in a few days. It has one of the most compelling story arcs of any anime I've seen. The early episodes are interesting but not exceptionally so with an unstable protagonist a schlub and some idiot cosplay girl. But it's amusing and various characters are added. The time travel story starts slowly but this is necessary and the series becomes incredibly compelling as the results of small time shifts create big problems. ,31933,204,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Easily one of my all time favourites even with a slow start when it all starts to come together and you start to speculate about this that and the other it becomes even more amazing when it's something you didn't even consider. Loveable characters great story and a little bit of tragedy followed by relief it is easy to get into. I watched this twice over and it just made me think more because I understood almost everything that was happening I would recommend to anyone regardless of what genre you like. ,31964,210,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is an interesting story though filled with paradoxes upon themselves.  Similar stories have in fact been explored quite often before such as  Retroactive  (1997) which is a very good example of that kind of gripping time paradox story with unintended consequences and a nearly endless loop the main characters can find themselves stuck within.  The themes types of consequences and methods of them are pretty similar but the story back drop and causes and effects of why things are happing or who or what are behind them are a bit different.  Another similar story is found in Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  The main difference with that is the diety twist and the magical girl sub theme.  A much older story with a modestly similar theme is  Somewhere In Time  (1980).  This is another good movie I would highly recommend as well. In that story though the main character risks it all to constantly go back and change things the main adjustment is he does not go back to the same point in time to try to change the dire consequences.  Yet the concept style theme modus opperendi plot and such are along the same lines.  It is also more of a romance and drama than a pure mystery or thriller type story.  ,31965,211,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A good friend of mine recommended this anime to me about a year ago saying it was  good  and I should check it out. So I did. I watched this anime within 2 days. It makes you think intensely about everything and it is all very interesting and mysterious. This anime will always keep you wondering what is going to happen the next episode which makes you keep watching. This anime also can be very depressing at parts. I shed a few tears because of a few different situations Okabe was in with his  hostage.  This brings up great ideas and possibilities that could happen in this world also which makes it even more thrilling. I recommend this anime to anyone and everyone a masterpiece this is!

Starting off this is one of those anime that you kind of have to sit through till the end to really enjoy and like...but trust me and anyone who has when they say it was worth every second of it.  Its a brilliant anime in my opinion(<--keyword) at the beginning like i said its a bit hard to keep watching and kind of leaves more to be desired but as it goes one you can help but to understand that was kind of the point... maybe not intentional but its how it had to be for as the story continues the complexity expands and makes more and more sense....oddly at the same time a lack of sense kind of have to keep track of it all. characters and there development are spot on the animation style as clean/realistic/and complimented the story and characters perfectly. As for sound...i dont have that much experience in that but i can say the title and ending were perfect in there respects to the rest of the anime without giving away details but as art itself was very nice voice actors were great and none seemed awkward at all(they matched the characters)....besides that no adnormals sounds...,32012,229,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Im liking it so far but it seems awfully over rater. I was expecting more from this but I was mislead. I like it but not enough for it to become a favourite though the themes and characters are something I enjoy. Shame that some are down right irritating and they commonly fill the episodes with his boring-ass speeches,32023,234,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Steins;Gate is a legend one of the most popular anime ever. Apparently. I couldn't really speak to that because I really really hate it. The animation style is interesting (though not mind-blowing) and the sound design is basically fine. But the characters and plot of this show are painfully irritating. I'd honestly rather have triple-pneumonia than watch another episode of this show. John Titor? Are you kidding me with this s**t? But the main reason is simply that the main cast basically without exception are wholly unlikeable and really annoying.,32026,235,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Confusing and odd at first but gets interesting when the time travel starts coming into play. Who's ever heard of a time machine made out of a microwave? :) In the end all the confusing stuff from the beginning all makes sense which is odd for an anime they tend to just leave you confused about the details. Story is also kinda sweet and tender hearted kinda sad too.,32031,237,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is the best time travel show or movie you will ever watch. This show tells you a lot about time travel and the risk it takes. It does start off a litle slow but after ep. 4 OMG its great and you will be glued to the tv.shows the animation is great also and the sound!!,32032,238,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's has the most captivating story line i've seen in a very long time. It's complex and somewhat intelectual in parts. The charcaters are very defined in charcter the attention to detail is insane. It is also a very unique concept based of the Story of John Titor which was very cool and intresting event that was made and comprised to look almost flawless. The depth in which so far it's gone intot the world lines theory is good. It could be a bit more psyhicy but that could make it a bit to complex for some people.,32063,246,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of my most favorite animes now. The first episode was meh but after the second it got only better. I would rate this a 10 out of 10 for sure. The only thing i had a problem was with (yes i know its an anime and not real) was that when ruka sent his/her text back in time to his mom how would that change his gender? Thats the only think i had a problem with that i didn't like but everything else was perfect. I also thought it would have been longer and explained some things about certain characters more but thats just me being curious. If you like anime about time travel and lots of twist that you would have never expected this is the anime for you and its only 25 eps! ,32071,248,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I must admit at first I didn't believe that this was going to be a good anime. The main character was annoying me and I felt that everything was weak; but I persevered and was surprised how much of a awesome show it was. The concept is original the characters are deep and have compelling emotions. Every episode leaves you wanting more. I find myself jumping in anticipation for the next episode in excitement. This is a great anime.,32089,256,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i only watched it because i was bored at work. i was about to stop it and look for another anime at episode 7 but then i managed to watch till ep13. but then i did not have anything else to do that evening so i watched all episodes. the idea of the story is goodbut the series felt  boring and it was hard to watch. ,32093,258,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Steins; Gate es un anime del 2011 basado en un video juego creado por 5pb./Nitroplus una colaboración para nada nueva pues ya habían trabajado anteriormente para la creación de Chaos;Head (La cual también fue llevada al anime pero de esta es mejor ni hablar).,32108,262,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't say enough about this show... even though it kinda felt slow at the begining it really pulls you in and rewards you four your patience. Granted there are a few moments that can leave you with a  huh ? sort of feeling (ok for me this was mostly what happens with our friend the Miko but that's besides the point). I loved it just watch it... I'll be up there with Death Note FMA and Geass eventually!,32136,265,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I felt as if this anime was barely a yaoi and it was just a history lesson. I don't care to learn about Japan's history I want to see guy on guy. I was very confused throughtout the entire thing and I got bored pretty fast. It was good and I liked the romantic levels but it was more focused on what happened with Japan and England and all that in a whole than the couple. ,32153,278,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i think that this anime was great mad me sad and happy when bout died at the same time ...and love the action scenes they were well made....,32158,279,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is a typical love story between two characters who can't be together. It is however different to the others that I have seen like this. Partly because it is yaoi and two men which doesn't seem to be explored in this sort of way and I thought it had a generally more beautiful feel to it.,32160,280,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A comedy that im sure if you have read the Synopsis has a very strong Ecchi side. Condoms shown in the first 15 seconds And a whole lot of boobs. It has a strange story but something that im sure anyone can handle.Actually im pretty convinced this is meant to be one of those Near-Hentai experiences. Though slightly enjoyable due to its rather energetic atmosphere.,32188,287,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: This was an early anime I watched. To be quite honest the story was solid however the way it was told would've been vastly improved if there'd been more than 6 episodes. After the finale I found myself thinking how abrupt it was and how much I wanted to see what happened after or perhaps a bit more meat in between the beginning and end.,32195,291,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story,32215,296,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Very fun to watch. I enjoyed this quite a bit. Fast pacedemi-decent story and a decent amount of blood I really wish this had morepisodes to it another season or set of OVAs but after the last 5 or 6 minutesf the sixth episode I realized why. I thought it was pretty sad but it put alosing to the series and I’m very content with that.,32218,297,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There wasn't any Reviews added for this Anime so I decided to make one myself. To be quite honest I watched the first anime in the Saishuu Shiken Kujira series And I didn't like it.. Moreove it kept me wondering what's happening here through mostly of the series.. Due to this I concidered dropping Saishuu Shiken Kujira Progressive. Seeing now after having actually seen the Show I am really glad I decided to give it another try.. The way I see it The stories don't really contain much simmilarities exept from sharing the one main male character.. So Anyways..,32221,299,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sooo hate me or what the storyline is somewhat decent with interesting theme which is survival game. However I ddon't think there is a shred of comedy in this anime. The fight scene is very interesting though with all the strategies and all.,32224,301,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you are bored I would watch it. Even though it has incest in it between brother and sister I really didn't mind it. I think it could be awkard if you have a brother or sister and you watch it. The Tags should be Ecchi Hentai Romance and of course Incest.,32233,308,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was not a terrible little OVA. Not something I expected either hahahaha! I guess I should have read a synopsis for it first. Anyways a typical incest love story for an anime. Nothing in depth. The animation was above average for something that's starting to near hentai. And yes I said  NEAR  hentai. I just read reviews of this calling it hentai go ahead and ignore those morons there is NO explicit sex in this OVA. The sound was pretty good for this show as well. And the characters were pretty run-of-the-mill. Though I did enjoy Aki quite a bit I had to take away some points she gained because her brother Sora was so annoying. He whined and whimpered like a fucking girl the ENTIRE show NON-STOP! I have a theory that Aki is really a lesbian and just likes Sora over his twin sister Nami because he's more of a girl than her.,32237,309,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Finally some negima fanservice... - except the girls when shown in bikinis or whatever inexplicably become huge-breasted uber-muscular 20-somethings...WTF? The fanservice is bizzarely drawn despite the quality of the animation being higher than the series and the plot is nearly nonexistant in this Spring Special OVA. The characters and voices are all there but again the fan service is just disturbing and the lack of any reasonable plot just makes it all the more lame.,32251,316,2019-04-13 21:35:40

TONS better then the series. The first episode I liked theost with bits and pieces in the second. Class Rep and Asuna were the only 2 Iiked in the OVA especially Asuna.,32253,318,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,32254,319,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story was completely implied which I enjoy sometimes it made it easy to just start watching. Immediately I thoguht alternate reality and filled in the blanks from there. It was a lot like SAO but with less background. The animation for the most part I really liked but I noticed that it was very focused on the foreground while the background would have way too much of a fake feel to it it reminded me of RWBY which I absolutely hated the animation of although once I ignored the backgrounds it was very pleasing. I'm not one who cares much for sound which makes me a bad judge for that(I've watched a few series without sound and it made almost no difference to me). In my opinion the only character I liked was hephaestus and that's purely based on looks but I always have to root for the main character getting through their struggle(there wasn't much of one). I was entertained the entire time and trying to answer the question  Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?  and came to the answer no. I think this anime is very open to different opinions and implications since so few things are given a sense of being indefinite.,32255,320,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"When this anime first came out everyone compared it to SAO for better or for worst. Just like SAO people thought it would be the best light novel of the season. Some were utterly disappointed others were satisfied. Here is my take on the  best light novel of the season ",32256,321,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So about this review firstly to say this show is terribly overrated IMHO. I need to teel you that I’m big fan of all kind of RPG games BUT same as in SAO case They just fucked up. Even tho I still think DanMachi is a bit better than SAO I can’t fully grasp the reason why. Maybe it’s just that I didn’t actually expect much from DanMachi. I just wanted something I wouldn’t have to think about too much. Which is exactly what happened. So I got what I went for.,32257,322,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime packed with comedy ! and adventure tons ! of moments that make you wanna reach through the computer ! Its fabulous I wish they had a tad bit real romance and not jsut about boobs ( its not funny after the 17th time) However there is alot of potential in this anime and I think its great. ,32259,323,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This story is so bizarrely akin to a role playing video game it maybe hard to take seriously.  The title itself is misleading and leads much to be desired but when watching it you can easily be taken in.  Your attention can be totally swiped by the surprisingly well thought out story and premise aside from the somewhat haphazard and goofy video game like references it is a pretty good story within it's own well thought out setting.  I say goofy because the story/author tries to make allusions to how these video game references make sense in a real world like setting but it is still difficult to overcome all those things that clearly say video game.  That aside if you can let your suspension of disbelief ride out the story it is a very enjoyable experience.  It could use a better title and the characters could use better more logical names.  Bell just does not sound like a name at least not for a male character.  I am often disturbed by how little Japanese authors seem to pay attention to or understand Western or American culture that they can get things so far off base like crappy character names.  It is puzzling that Japanese intellects of any kind who seem to pursue so many subjects so diligently can be so out of their element looking up or researching such basic facts about Western cultures.  ,32262,324,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've always loved RPGs and it feels just like one and so I found the story intresting. I had no real qualms with the animation. For sound neither the OP/ED got me very excited but they weren't bad either. Loved the characters with Ais as my favorite. She reminded me of Mashiro Shiina so much. Overall I felt it was enjoyable and watched the whole thing in one sitting.,32267,326,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So far just by watching the first episode I can tell the anime is going to be epicplus as it is not only gonna be funny but also has a deep romance in it.. If you are looking for a anime which is fun to watch that will make you cheerfull and turn your mood to zero to ten..this anime is a must to watch..soplease go ahead and watch it..,32269,328,2019-04-13 21:35:40
personally one of my favourite anime's i've watched. the story is well told and has many characters you will love and a few you will hate you can't help but too laught at the comedy side of this anime while also enjoying the action of watching the star underdog main charecter become a badass. must watch. ,32270,329,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I went into this series knowing that it was going to be different than the other two (simply because the endless repititions ended with the final arc of Kai).  That said the series still felt like all filler to me.  It focused more on humour than violence which is something that is unexpected from Higurashi I thought.,32293,340,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I hated Rei. Now before you flag me no I did not read the visual novel it was based off of. My review is generally on the anime. Now Higurashi (the first two seasons) in my opinion is one of the most epic animes of all time second to Dragon Ball. The storytelling was great and in my opinion was faithful to the VN (again I did not read the VN so don't complain to me). And I believed that it should've ended after the finale of Kai because the endles cycle of murders was resolved and everyone could now go on with their lives. However they make a five episode OVA named Higurashi Na Naku Koro Ni Rei. Now I think that the word means ''light  but I'm not so sure. In the first episode of Rei it takes place at a community pool. WTF right? Anyway Keiichi gets swimming trunks from a store that allegedly give him the power to make women fall in love with him. He then fantasizes about his friends and... it's disturbing. So the girls learn that if the trunks stay on Keiichi for too long he'll fall in love with himself. So they try to get their friend out of this. And Rena talks about wanting to see his... furry seal (crickets chirping). So anyway they try to get help from their former nemesis Takano who appeared to be wearing a whorish  swimsuit. Rika promises to let her into the shrine if she helps them to defeat Keiichi. Then they get help from their teacher Sonozaki who was enraged when she thought that Keiichi made fun of her favorite dish curry. They then get help from Hanyuu and lastly Shion who brings her taser to the pool. Who the hell does that?! Before they could succeed a group called the Soul Brothers come to Keiichi's aid. They include: Jirou Tomitake and Ooshi. But Mion turns them against him and try to take his trunks. Eventually his trunks fall off and all is well. The first episode sucked! The last episode was okay though. Rena accidentally ingests an item called magatama which she falls in love with the person holding the other piece. Tomitake and Takano end up competing over her. But overall Rei was crap. Please don't watch it.,32308,346,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Al tough having basically nothing to do with the original series apart from general setting and few terms derivative from that Macross Plus presents a very solid project which actually deserves much more than just OVA/theatrical release.

A pretty good short OVA series. I have two different opinions on the story. The overall plot is is just so-so. I did not find it particularly interesting and it felt rushed. It felt like it was ending just as it finished getting started. For a show based around fighter jets that transform into mechas there is surprisingly very little action. It was the characters' stories are what made the show interesting. Over the course of the show they gave little hints about the background of the characters and I just felt like I wanted to know more. The characters were alright. They seemed kind of bland at first but they really improved throughout the show.,32322,352,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Guilty Crown is like that Hollywood bockbusters with great director great cast amazing visual effects cool soundtrack and an interesting plot when you finally see it with high hopes it dissapointed you. Why? Like the most of this cases is the screen writting.,32344,357,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I lost interest in this show shortly before getting to the very last episodes.  The characters were too illogical to understand even by their own at least stated senses of morals such as  protecting others ? Like when the attempt was made to save a class mate from helicopters.  It really is a poor story when there is no connection no one to sympathize with no one to empathize with or no one to root for and this anime had NONE of them.  It is hard if not impossible to empathize with characters who turn into such brutal heartless monsters even against their own so called friends or family.  It is impossible to root for anyone that like wise treats even those that trust and befriend characters like disposable trash.  It is also impossible to even connect with anyone in the anime.  They are either not deep enough characters or so quickly and easily twisted beyond recognition as anything resembling human or they are not in the anime long enough even when any serious attempt is made to build up the depth of any character to therefore connect with any of them.  In fact as the story progresses the sense is not of a growing empathy or connection but actually of even greater distance disillusionment and distance as far from any of those characters as can be.  ,32345,358,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is noting special.I forced myself to watch it to see if it get any better but it sadly doesn't. I got to half of episode 9. stopped after that. I kinda hated the main characters. The only thing I liked about this anime was the music. ( opening theme song mainly) Its not the worst anime I have seen but it noting special... I found it really dull and annoying..The animation was pretty good,32346,359,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Guilty Crown was originally going to be my favorite anime. But after Shu took over the school I hated it. The anime went down a path I did not anticipate nor like. I truly wish it had gone differently.,32365,365,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Guilty crown is one of the most popular animes till now. The consept and the plot of the story were made well. The characters were all very nice. This anime has a very good artwork and there are so many fighting scenes that made this anime interesting. But what I don't like about this anime is that some parts of the story doesn't makes sense. And I'm kinda dissapointed about the ending. Most ppl said that the ending was really sad. But what I expected is that the ending would made me cry but it didn't. But overall this anime is very worth it for you all to watch. Too bad there isn't a second season for this anime. :(,32370,368,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I wish they had a feels rating here lol cause there are alot in this anime. Going into watching this I didnt expect it to be as good as I found it to be after completeing it. The story was great it kept me wanting more with every episode. The animation was flawless. The sound was great and the characters were outstanding. I found Inori to be a bit dry as a character but as the anime went on I began to see why but she still stands out as a kinda dry character. Shu is awesome. His character development couldnt have been any better. The supporting cast is all solid. No weak link anywhere really. The only bad thing about this anime is that it leaves a couple loop holes at the end. Nothing major but things I would have liked to know. Overall I cant wait to purchase this anime on Blu ray. ,32377,370,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Where to begin with this one?  Without giving spoilers this one was one confusing ride.  While the concept is pretty exciting (voids as manifestations of our soul... that's kinda awesome) there were FAR too many plot holes and inconsistency.  Some things came out of nowhere while others just weren't bothered to be explained.  I was only truly intrigued by a few episodes of the entire series... which is pretty sad.  ,32379,371,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Guilty Crown is an entertaining anime with a good plot interesting characters though some things are underexplained or rushed. Several points are left unexplained until the last third of the show which of itself is not bad. One major point that once explained made the show much better was why Inori is so infuriatingly bland. Her character fleshes out a bit near the end. The other characters are fantastic. It is unusual for the hero to be portrayed in a negative light yet Guilty Crown spends a great deal of time exploring Shu's mistakes. The theme about the power of love is a bit over-played but the vehicle is refreshingly unique. The ending leaves much to be desired though with a bit of analysis (and some googling) closure can be had. The sound and animation quality is great and there is some lovely haunting music associated with Inori. Overall a very good anime that explories the affects of relationships both good and bad and partiuclarly the power of love while providing fast paced action with an ecchi flavor without dipping too heavily into stereotypes and cliches.,32383,374,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,32384,375,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first half of the series is fantastic it comes to what seems like an ending...and then it doesnt end. The main story is more or less complete with all of the antagonist and protagonists having achieved or failed to achieve their respective goals and everything seems neatly wrapped up but the series continues and becomes more and more muddy with characters changing the way they have behaved for the entire series up to that point. Character motivations change their reactions change it just feels like a different person wrote the second half of the series. ,32385,376,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think this Anime in spite of that is a typical story in the beggining in the story the developing is great with its OST. I like the changes in the principal characters and the rest but in the las episodes  (20-22) the developing of the story can't allow enjoy at all.,32397,378,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is great when you turn off the subs. I was watching it when it came out and I was dazzled by the beautiful animation and amazing sound then i realized the story was crap and the characters were crap. I dropped it after I ran out of epiodes and never came back. But if you want some thing to dazzle your eyes and ears and dont care so much about the plot then go right ahead and watch; it's really really pretty.,32400,379,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:,32418,389,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Guilty Crown is the story about a student that becomes involved in a war between the governing body of Japan and a terrorist group that works against it. The backdrop is a violent virus outbreak that shatters Japan and kills millions of people - the rest is explained not always very well - throughout the story.,32419,390,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright I'll admit this anime was pretty good. Good character development lots of insight to the personal struggles of the main character (Shu). Songs were pretty nice too and it invoked a lot more emotion than i thought it would. Only annoying bit is just that the beggining of the show is really...I don't know...annoying. It feels very stereotypical until episode 12 or so when things really start to pick up. So a warning to the wise if you begin watching this anime do so with the understanding that the first half isn't all that great to watch. However if you make it through that the payoff is massive and you get a story with just the right amount of romance action dialogue and development. Fantastic Anime.,32420,391,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's a good anime I only wished that they put extra depth in the story. It was so good in terms of animation and music and the characters were okay but the story just seemed to me like it had a lot of gaps. That it seemed too fast in a way that moments (happy sad & difficult) seemed like they didn't have time to stay in the spotlight. Also I would've liked to know more about the story in the eyes of the other characters. But other than those it was an okay romance-scifi-dystopian-shounen anime.,32455,401,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is just another typical shounen action science fiction fantasy anime.,32467,403,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched this anime because I expected the same feel as Mirai Nikki. It's a a tragic anime about love and loss the the same shitty ending as Mirai Nikki. I hate this anime for making me cry. The minus was the fanservice it was not HOTD but I would take it more seruosly if there were no bouncing boobs during serious moments. Or how every time a charcater got their void taken out (mostly girls) they looked as if they were having an orgasm. ,32468,404,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is really nothing special. I can't even label it a huge waste of time because the episodes last about 4 minutes each so in less than hour you're done.,32472,405,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: The story wasn't the worst but it wasn't the absolute best either. It definitely takes a couple of episodes for you to really get into the whole story. There could have been a bit more dramatic trouble for our princesses. The major problem that I found with this storyline was that it was very unsatisfactory. Like the end I definitely felt there should have been something more so the audience would get a clear cut ending.  ,32502,414,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mass Effect: Paragon Lost takes place during the events of Mass Effect 2 and serve as the backstory for James Vega (who does not appear in the games until 3).

Out of the first three Digimon movies the one with Diaboromon was my favorite as it explored a new idea while raising the stakes pretty high and it was the movie I remembered best from my childhood. However I can’t say I remembered this fourth movie at all—partly because it wasn’t part of the package for the single American Digimon movie and partly because it doesn’t leave as much of an emotional impact.,32543,422,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I think this movie was meh nothing like movie 4. It didn't have much battle buildup and the story wasn't that good compared to the first 3 movies. Overall I give it 5 since it was fine but nothing I'd rewatch anytime soon.,32547,423,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As I watch this anime I loved in the first half and then it with Momo going back and forth really bugged. Also the fact that I had a deja vu as if I saw this already but I know I didn't. Then it it hit me The Vampire Diaries has same plotline (and I mean EXACTLY!) Elena going back and forth between Stefan and Damon. Mind you I stop watching TVD two years it pist me off soooo much especially when the show is not going anywhere. Thank god this anime is only 25 episodes and not an ongoing tv program. These types of shows drives me insane!!!!,32551,425,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay so I watched the whole anime through to the end. I must say that I am disappointed. I wanted so much for a happy ending. But there wasn't one. My feeling were ready to explode into a huge moment of complete happiness and satisfaction. But I could have been more disappointed.,32553,426,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"I can't believe the low scores all my fellow reviewers have given this anime. This anime is by far my favorite anime ever. Perhaps they only watched the horrible terrible funimation dub... It was truly awful changed alot of the characters' personas and had them say/do things that were out of character for them. Not to mention the annoying tendency that they felt that they had to explain every single little thing and spell it out for the viewer. I remember the scene where a girl decides to trip momo by extending her leg in the class Momo trips and the girl's leg shows a bandaid like symbol as an animation technique to kinda show the impact of the fall. Funimation decides to make Momo say  Nice hair removal strips . I can assure you in the fansubbed version she never said anything so ridiculous. ",32555,427,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story line was good and it was enjoyable to watch but the characters were all annoying. Momo cries in everyone of them and Toji's an idiot who can't think for himself. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed watching it I just wanted to punch my screen at least once on every episode. Over all it does make a good love triangle if you're for something like that.,32563,431,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime was really good to me. At first I judged it because of the animation and how the art looked but then I gave it a shot. I don't regret it at all. I really don't care much for endings as long as there is alot of good conflicts and tension going around with the characters. It was a rollercoaster of emotion for me. If you're someone who likes drama then I recommend this. ,32580,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is by far one of the most rediculous anime i have ever watched. i didnt even get the point of the love triangle. she goes from touji to kairi in like a heart beat. in when kairi was late because of his brother. she switch back to touji like it was an instinct. ,32581,439,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After watching the whole series of Peach Girl last night I have to say I am disappointed.  In fact I would relate this story to a train wreck happening in slow motion and even though its horrible you can't look away.

This is my favorite anime of all time (and I've watched over 220 completed series at time of this review's writing) The reason why I love this anime so much is due to the character development and progression throughout the series. The characters are so well written and their dynamics are so intriguing. They make you feel very passionately either strong like or dislike for each character.,32588,444,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid came to me at a time wheny love for anime was suffering a most unnatural downturn. I thought itsredecessor FMP generic and overhyped and thus harboured low expectations whenmbarking upon this show. The FMP franchise is beset with chronic disjointedness while FMP delivers a standardised mecha plot involving various criminals the side story Fumoffus a highly successful spastic comedy. TSR again is a very different kettlef fish in that it adopts a more brutal narrative style that allows theharacters to strut their serious side. I also think it’s a remarkable leap uprom its predecessor FMP.,32596,448,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Persona 4 when I watched it at first it was somewhat slow but at the end of the first episode i was curious enough to watch the next episode. The story shows great character depth gives off a western/ japanese culture which shows alot in its game which is quite fun to play. I would recommed this. The story is mystery/comedy/action.,32660,480,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The Animatrix was a unique and fun experience. Although not exactly what I had hoped. It was awesome to see many different styles of animation talking about one subject (sort of). However because it is a compilation of several short movies it is hard to give it an overall rating. What I will rate this on is how the stories worked in conjunction to the actual Matrix Trillogy. I had hoped to see stories about semi important events that did not make it into the matrix movies. There were nine shorts. Of those had something fairly related to the main story.  The Final Flight of The Osiris  was about the closest it got. The Second Renaissance Part I and II was also cool. I enjoy origin stories personally so it was cool to watch. The others didn't really have much to do with the series other than referencing the characters. They are awesome stand alone works. I recommend it to those who like seeing different artistic styles. But dont go into it thinking you'll see the animated version of neo or morpheus. (Trinity appears though).,32686,493,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The Animatrix is a collection of short films 9 in total that where created from the creators of the Matrix series and anime directors that inspired them when they where creating the Matrix. Some of the stories are good while others are not so good. What is nice about this is that each story is animated in a different style and features different characters and voice actors. This is worth the watch for anybody that enjoyed the Matrix film.,32693,495,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,32695,496,2019-04-13 21:35:40
OH SNAP!  It's the Matrix!  It must be awesome!,32696,497,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Una increible animacion basado en la pelicula Matrix con diferentes verciones del director la verdad que esta serie de mini capitulos esta muy bien lograda y con el uso de las computadoras tenemos una calidad muy parecida a la vida real.,32697,498,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before anything else I have to say that it's a must to have watched The Matrix (although not necessarily Matrix Reloaded) in order to have a good understanding of The Animatrix. All the episodes are anchored in the world presented in The Matrix and a chockfull of references abound to events characters and situations that had been seen on the aforementioned film. Neo and Trinity (aptly voiced by their live-action counterparts Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss) even make appearances in the stories at some points. First we have  Final Flight of the Osiris  which I thought had the most arresting visuals of all the episodes. It's from the folks who brought us  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within  but this time the computer-generated characters look even more real (even I didn't think it was possible) than those in Final Fantasy ever did -- down to every hair pore and freckle. Story-wise though it is as the title says -- about the last flight of a ship called Osiris. Osiris is under heavy attack from an army of sentinels. One of its crew members a beautiful woman named Jue decides to plug in and make one final broadcast in the Matrix. Simple yet stunning not to mention brimming with fan service every moment of it left me in awe. Next we have what are arguably the most powerful and meaningful episodes in terms of plot  Second Renaissance . Second Renaissance shows us how man advances in terms of robotics creating mechanical assistants with sufficient artificial intelligence to carry out various laborious tasks. The problem is the robots become too smart. They start clamoring for equal rights and recognition among humans but the humans are staunch in their belief that robots must be their slaves. A war between humans and robots ensue... with very mixed results. Second Renaissance is directed by Blue Submarine No. 6's Mahiro Maeda. Overall I found Second Renaissance to be a superior piece of work with its realistic storytelling approach and equally appropriate imagery. Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe tries his hand at the franchise with  A Kid's Story  and  Detective Story  which are probably the most directly related episodes to The Matrix movie.  A Kid's Story  (see third screenshot below) is reminiscent of what happened to Neo. A teenage kid makes contact with Neo on the internet which in turn unleashes hordes of men in black suits who go after him in school. I found the art and animation to be unique and stylish although I didn't really care for the character designs. The scenes seemed to consist of colored pencil sketches moving with great fluidity giving the episode a surrealistic effect that matched what was taking place perfectly. Meanwhile  Detective Story  (see second screenshot below) is about an investigator hired to track down a hacker called Trinity. He succeeds but there's a price to be paid for their meeting. Detective Story's monochromatic look reminded me of Dick Tracy-esque comic strips you'd see on newspapers except that its artwork is a lot more refined. Of the two Watanabe offerings I'd say I liked Detective Story better. It took only one look for me to deduce that the fourth episode  Program  (see first screenshot below) is Yoshiaki Kawajiri's (director of the cult classics  Ninja Scroll  and  Wicked City ) contribution. The character designs were just so... Ninja Scroll-ish as anyone who has seen Ninja Scroll can attest. Program shows us two people arguing about going back to how their life was before or living with the truth of the Matrix. They present their points while slashing at each other with their weapons of choice. What really struck me about this episode were the fighting scenes which came across as an ingenious blend of 2D and 3D effects. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. In  World Record  we have an Olympic runner who's obsessed with setting a world record. Majority of the screening time is devoted to actual run -- sweat dripping muscles rippling... that kind of thing. Of all the episodes I found this to be the least attractive. The characters looked weird and the story was so-so to say the least. I could not even enjoy watching the guy run because he looked so... unsightly.  Beyond  (see last screenshot below and title graphic) is about a punk-ish young woman who discovers that her cat is lost. She goes looking for him in a so-called  haunted house  and discovers a world of wonders inside its premises. It shows us what happens when some ordinary uninitiated folk stumble upon a part of the Matrix. The art and animation are very colorful compared to all the other episodes and watching it felt like getting a breath of fresh air. Last but not least there's  Matriculated  Aeon Flux-creator Peter Chung's take on the Matrix. Like  Program  I knew right off who had spearheaded this feature because the character designs are exactly like those I had seen in Aeon Flux -- defined facial contours lithe and willowy bodies and so forth. Matriculated is about a group of people who  rehabilitate  various sentinels by plugging them in and convincing them that they are better off siding with humans. I found it to be one of the more interesting and solidly narrated episodes in this collection. Visually speaking it's satisfying I guess... it's just that I'm not really a fan of Peter Chung's animation style. To cap this review off I should mention that this is one of the rare occasions where the English language version is a lot better than the Japanese counterpart. The Animatrix is overall an excellent collection definitely a must-see for fans of The Matrix and anime. It's the perfect title for easing someone into anime... provided he / she had already seen The Matrix and liked it.,32698,499,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is absolutely amazing I love this title so much probably its one of the best anime what I've watched in my boring life. Anime from Kyoto Animations so in anime we can see how amazing are the animations. Oreki for me was the best character I like him so much Chitanda was amazing too I love her! Music in anime is amazing too in good moments etc. Story isn't maybe the best but its good too.,32716,504,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely love this anime! While watching it I could not stop grinning or making comments it has caused so much emotion in me. It's so funny and the cases are interesting my favourite one is the valentines one even though it was not complicated at all I think the way all the characters behaved during this was so cute and unexpected (Eru crying Satoshi saying that he loves Mayaka and Houtarou getting so protective over Eru and Mayaka). I wish that Mayaka and Satoshi got together as well as Eru and Houtarou (it made me quite angry that they didnt and the makers of the anime gave me so much hope!) I also wish that it was longer because this anime is just amazing.,32717,505,2019-04-13 21:35:40

However his elder sister convinces him to join the Classics Club to keep it from getting abolished. Oreki joins the club in-volutarily and his life is turned upside down. There he meets Eru Chitanda a curious teenage girl who drags Oreki into mysteries that only he can solve but doesn't want to do them (Even though he has too). They are both joined by Fukube Satoshi Oreki's friend and Mayaka Ibara and together they live life together and solve everyday life mysteries together as club.,32733,510,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime actually turned out better than I expected it to be. Granted it does lack a focused story and a succinct plot which could have it score better in the story department. But a light hearted and comedic anime such as this has its own merits as well. ,32737,514,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a very typical KyoAni piece. It is light and enjoyable fairly average with just enough quirks (aka talking bird) to be interesting.

One of the most realistic anime series I've seen. Mostly dramatic and depressing but there's also hope and incredible friendship. I was only looking for love before watching this. Now I see brotherhood is even more important. It has sexual scenes a little gore and blood so I would rate it 17+(Even tho I'm 15 :D).  I really think this is a must-watch.

Honey Tokyo is a promotional video made to attract torist it's a mixture of animation and live action clips. The entire video is about 11 minutes long not much of a movie. It tells the story of a girl who is searching for happiness to bring back to the future but ends up discovering happiness right in her own heart. There isn't a lot of plot there isn't really a story it's basically a brochure for what to expect when visiting Japan. The animation is subpar the fact that there are live action clips mixed in really is distracting... the whole thing is fine as a promotional video but not much of an animated movie. If you're looking for activites to do while visiting tokyo this might be useful otherwise I'd say move on to the next movie.,32767,536,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It was a good anime and i was very interested in how they were gonna end it with how the development of the characters went and how the relationship developed for it to fucking end on a god damn filler. that stupid ass final episode ruined the entire anime for me and honestly i dont reccomend watching this at all unless you watch all but the final episode,32788,549,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sometimes I feel some specials were too short  but it was really good. They kept everything as it was before and there wasn't the kind of changes everyone hates in second seasons and OVAs. Our beloved characters experienced the typical adventures we could expect from them after the battle we saw earlier. I watched all ten in one day. I didn't had time to mark  watching  in my status. I directly clicked  watched  and started writing. Now you know what to do for your ten-minutes break (or more if you feel like it).,32826,575,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Supposedly this anime does not follow the manga exactly but season 3 does or at least does more closely.  This is part of the problem though.  Whether or not the manga was good is at this point somewhat irrelevant because they made 2 seasons with this story arc.  As it was it was a pretty good story.  It developed slowly over time and had a good climatic end game in both seasons.  This of course is good for a few reasons but the most important and obvious one is that it gives the viewer and writers time to develop the characters and watch the story unfold as it relates to those characters.  There is nothing wrong with the story save maybe a few mysteries that are somewhat difficult to understand until the end of seasons 1 and then season 2 respectively because each seasons unveils the answers to various questions that were either there early on or arose either later in season one or in season two.  Though there maybe a few things left unsaid or unanswered at the end of season one and even season two it has far fewer unanswered questions than season 3.  The animation though less detailed in some respects overall looks and is much better than season 3.  Season 3 actually oddly enough looks like it is an older anime than even season one.  The only major differences are that #1 Suigintou (not sure spelling) are a tad cuter in season 3 and that things like dresses and umbrellas and such have slightly more detail.  However the characters for the most part look far less refined and cute or even doll like than in the first 2 seasons.  They essentially fumbled the ball there.  The story of season 1 and 2 are far more heartwarming and easier to identify with.  The quality is much higher for season 1 than season 3.  It maybe better than the story told in the manga as of yet I am unsure as I have not read it but as implied by season 3 it looks to be a very likely probability.  A great deal of time is spent delving into the psyche of Jun and his relationships to society and his sister.  A great fail though is his parents are missing and his sister hardly appears to be old enough to take care of herself or him as an adult.  Anime is very odd with respect to treatment of family and even main characters.  it is as if they do not think anyone over age 20 exists unless as  red shirt  souless npc drop off characters.  Sadly you do not feel much better of a sense here.  This is one area where season 3 overshadows seasons 1 and 2 there are adults in season 3 and they are treated well even as a child Jun meets at least one understanding adult that helps greatly to enrich the story.,32844,587,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've rated the series 5/5 and this crap  movie  gets 0.5 stars.,32864,600,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,32866,601,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let me start by saying I am a fan of Sora no Otoshimono and have not read the manga (not a huge manga fan).,32867,602,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't normally write reviews so I'll keep this short. If you are a fan of this series whether it be the manga the anime or both... Don't waste your time here. I have no clue what the producers or director was thinking when they created this piece of shit excuse for a final anime. All they managed to do was shatter my hopes and dreams for this series leaving an aftertaste that closely resembles dirt.,32868,603,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As a preface to this I personally read the manga before watching the anime and films. If you haven't read the manga then this review may or may not mean as much. I dunno... it's still a shitty movie in my opinion.,32869,604,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Itroduction,32871,606,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let me start by saying that Don't Leave Me Alone Daisy has been one of worst and most disturbing anime I've watched.  There is nothing remarkable about this show neither the acting nor the animation.  All the flaws there aside the worst part is the plot and characters.,32872,607,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Update after episode 5: it's still the same crap,32875,608,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What may seem comical at first appears to be a very good way to get some real knowledge into people. Instead of just receiting knowledge back at people it is using the format that people know and trust. The first 3 episodes were full of the fun and comedy I expect of a good comedic anime but I ended up learning information I didn't realise. I even ended up having some insight into how the Japanese treat the illnesses I already know in the West. All the episodes have spoken to me in some way too.,32876,609,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wish my medical lectures were half as entertaining as these! If you are looking for a quick anime fix these 5 minute episodes are surely to entertain you or at least good for a giggle. Med students or any medical professionals i think you will find this series delightful,32878,610,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A nice 5 minute fix to watch though nothing to great. It's a more educational Anime with a nice touch of comedy around every corner to keep your attention high. It has no story the characters aren't too special and everything is average. Its a nice change to see and is definitely worth giving a try if you loved seitokai Yakuindomo!,32879,611,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Truly my favorite genre of anime is Chanbara( swordfighting). Anime with Samurai! I'm sold! Sadly this is something I strongly suggest passing on. Personally it leaves a sour taste in my mouth and reminds me of the dark period of anime (80's-90's). When still unknown to the mainstream. Only known as the dreaded word  japanamation . When sleaze would pedal this garbage not even worth being called hentai. Skip this poor excuse for an anime unless you are an otaku and must fulfill your anime obligations.andabeard!,32894,620,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A fantastic (no pun intended) and highly overlooked series that is most definitely not for the casual audience. Picking up as a slow methodical thriller the show may confuse some people into thinking it is a fantasy adventure when in reality it expands into a classical sci-fi drama. With it's wonderful simplistic Tezuka-esque artstyle and splendid soundtrack this little gem is a must for any patient watcher.,32898,623,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't say I enjoyed this OVA too much and I think that largely has to do with the animation style. I don't neccessarily mind animation being changed up for shorts but while they did a good job at matching the style of the show with the 3D models it just felt gimmicky and there were moments the animation just felt odd. I feel like they needed to spend more time on movement and on the mouth movements for this style to really work.,32901,626,2019-04-13 21:35:40

After watching the 1st episode I can say that the visuals are pretty good and that the action seems like it will be promising; the powers that some of the characters contain are both pretty cool and interesting. The audio is nice and peaceful switching nice and smoothly into some amazing action soundtracks where viable. Overall I would recommend this anime to people who enjoy action-packed anime that are not only breathtaking but looks pleasing to the eyes! Kind of reminds me of Guilty Crown actually~ HOWEVER so far only the first episode has been what I described above so far the story has still yet to build up and the action has settled down a lot.,32920,633,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,32924,634,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The only good thing about this anime that ive seen so far is the sound and the animation. Character development so far is very cringy because of all of the little things they just pass off as something un needed. And the story is so bad and does not seem to be compatible to what the animation has for it. When kyotaro got his hand stabbed by the sword couldn't he have teleported out of it? He has teleported with things in contact with him before. I dont see the difference between having an object inside you making you unable to use your teleport power. I do like the music in it though its not too bad. But everything else is like half-assed for emphasis on  always try your best  even though they are definitely missing a lot of important details ,32926,635,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There was a good amount of comedy and serious parts to the movie I for one have not seen the series but this movie got me hooked on it now this is a must see guys.,32930,637,2019-04-13 21:35:40

STORY: 8/10,32936,642,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't necessarily like Tomoyo and Tomoya together but I loved this arc. Again it's a very overused arc but the characters brought emotion and a freshness to it that made this one so very good. The ending was perfect and I wanted to cry. Had I any tears left after After Story I probably would have. I wish these side alternate world arcs were more than just one episode because they both are great. I am a huge fan of Tomoya and Nagisa and prefer them together over any of the other characters but this is a nice addition to the series and a cool nod to the game.,32937,643,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This had been by farone of the best things I've seen so far.I love Tomoyo so much it's crazyad her reaction towards their breakup was so beautifulI couldn't help myself but love her more and more.The ending was everythingthe song playing in the back made me crydamn XD It doesn't really matter if you are a fan of the couple or notyou should watch this OVA becauseif only like a vision of another worldbecause it's really precious by all means,32943,644,2019-04-13 21:35:40
With Tomoyo being my favorite character in Clannad I was rather dissappointed that her arc wasn't farther developed so I was really happy to be able to watch an alternate ending with Tomoyo. I found that the plot was brilliant and although a bit cliched left me plenty satisfied. I just wish that they did more with Tomoyo.,32944,645,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I didn't see any reviews so I thought I'd post this up real quick *it's late*,32948,648,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My life or dislike of harems (reverse or not) depends on a few things. First of all it is funny to watch so many people trip and stumble going after the same girl or guy in this case gods after a mortal girl. I dislike endings where no clear winner for affections is chosen and this one stands on the edge. (No spoilers I promise). At the end I feel like I know who she will choose but they don’t say for certain...which annoyed me. However I enjoyed the series; I found it funny and fascinating to see how people think gods and a human would interact in these circumstances. All in all I think they are likely right. Some were spoiled selfish and others were kind. There were plot twists I didn’t expect and relationships forged and destroyed in ways I didn’t expect. It ends different than I would have guessed but good just the same. If there is ever a season two I will watch it happily. There's something about it that makes me hesitate to say it was absolutely amazing but it is most definitely interesting and worth the watch. I enjoyed it very much.,32949,649,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Una hermosa historia y genial forma de acercarse a la mitología.,32951,651,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Personally I love the story based with the Greek mythology and gods but I'm suckered for these anyway . The plot I generally think it was a bit of a let down only as the first episode shows most if the action of the whole anime which happens at the end anyway so the plot was there and in the open within the 5 mins,32953,652,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved this anime so much! It was so cute and had lots of characters to fall for. In the end on the last episode I was a waterfall. Now don't read this because it will make you question how it ends and I don't want you to hate me for that. But I was a wrek. And then the end was a total suprise and I was still crying....,32954,653,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So I actually work as an Anime reviewer to certain blogs so usually i'm not allowed to do this but I really loved this anime and I am certain the site I work for wont review this so I brought it up with the people I work with and they said Go For It! So here you go I also can't mention them in any relation to this so don't ask what site I review for anyway I wont tell you cause I review anonymously.,32956,654,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really liked this anime. The plot and the animations were just great the problem is how it ended. I know you guys would tell me otherwise probably saying  it gives the viewers imagination on what would happen next.  But i cant help but think what has happened to the other gods and the main lead character. But overall i really liked it that i would reccomemd this to you! ,32977,658,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Valkyrie Chronicles is an anime with a lot of different aspects to it but it’s mainly a story of defying the odds and making miracles happen with good judgment and well thought out strategies. There are many relationships that develop both on the protagonist’s side and the antagonist’s side. I applaud the creators for allowing the viewer to see the emotions of the antagonist and their frame of mind as opposed to making them completely evil bad guys as some series do. Doing that allows the viewer to see that everyone who is involved really has their own reasons for being where they are and helps the viewer understand the perspectives of both sides.  More importantly it is entertaining to see how they different sides play of each other and to a point where it is almost a duel of wits for the leaders like a chess game rather than a battle.,32995,665,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I know this series is based on a video game of the same name butince I haven't played the game I have no idea how the anime matchesp to that or even if it's supposed to. All I know is that this was anxcellent series roughly alternative history with intenseeart-pounding action moving drama mystery and romance set amid thehaos of war. It's sort of a David and Goliath tale: a small group ofilitia soldiers vs. the juggernaut of a vast empire threatening theiromeland.

Shakugan no Shana II is the 24 episode sequel to a fairly decent action fantasy anime. Based on a light novel (which I haven’t read due to lack of availability in English) incorporating unique magic elements with a typical modern-day Japanese high-school setting. I enjoyed the first season though it has been a long time since I watched it and my tastes have changed. But this seems to follow on from the good impression of season one despite containing things that ought to annoy me it didn’t. Certain aspects of the story are explained better though unlike season one it does take a while for the real story to start since it has the wishy-washy slice-of-life highschool stuff going on. So what exactly does this sequel add? Before I start I must disclose my dislike for harem/ecchi and that includes love triangles. I will also mention that I never reviewed the first season so I’ll start from scratch but for characters and story I’ll assume readers have watched it (may contain season one spoilers).,33031,685,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Better than the first season in terms of relation / character development. The main character finally does stuff and Yoshida becomes more actively involved. This season is more relaxing with less combat and more of a fun theme revolving around their daily lives and trips.,33032,686,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The first season wasn't that great to begin with. It didn't really get much better. This season barely has any action and is rather bland. The relationships develop better but other than that it wasn't good. Right from the start it was lame. The way it started like the first season but then the whole dream thing just boring. I don't know what else to say except this anime just isn't what I expected at all. I give it a 5 because the animation and sound was still good and the characters were better developed but the story just wasn't worth much.,33034,688,2019-04-13 21:35:40
K.O. Beast (actually the title I saw it released as is K.O. Century Beast but I didn't see a way to put that in there) is an anime you'll either like or absolutely loathe. The summary is a bit off as well; in the past the earth was split into two hemispheres. In the north evolved the beasts and in the south humans still thrived. However a problem with the split causes the hemispheres to reunite causing confict between the beasts and the humans. ,33035,689,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I enjoyed A Certain Scientific Railgun so I muddled through the much less entertaining A Certain Magical Index just so I could pick up the necessary context.  It turned out it was worth it just to get in on the inside jokes in these shorts.  They were hilarious.  There's no story or anything like that.  It's just a bunch of rapid fire gags but they are the best shorts I've watched thus far.  Unfortunately you need to watch Index to get them.,33036,690,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's not totally incoherent and you can follow the plot but new plot threads are introduced every episode and whatever the plot actually is it just doesn't matter because by the end your mind is blown.,33062,706,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of my favorite anime of all time. It is also one of the first anime i ever completed. I guess we can start by simply going down the score list.,33064,707,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What to say about Fooly Cooly well actually a bigger problem might be where to begin.  How about we start with this FLCL isn't an anime that is going to be liked by everyone.  In all honesty I'm fairly sure that you're either going to love FLCL or you're going to hate it.  I haven't meet anyone that I can think of that falls towards the middle they didn't love it at the sametime they didn't hate it either.  The story for FLCL isn't really all that of a simple one and I would have to say that one would need to watch it mulitple times in order to fully understand everything.  Though I've seen like 5 times already and still don't fully understand everything but then again that could just be me.  Needless to say that FLCL is interesting in more than one way.  Probably the most obvious of way is the animation still which employees a variety of different techinques within one episode.  Though I for one rather enjoyed seeing all the different styles used it probably won't be something that everyone will enjoy.  The sound or more specifically the soundtrack is probably the only major problem with the anime in my opinion.  Its not that the soundtrack was really all that bad but the lack of variety in the music got to be very repetitive very quickly.  Though the voice actors were all wonderfull both the english and japanese cast.  As for the characters themselves will pretty much like the anime you're either going to love or hate them and just like the anime you're going to have to watch it a couple times in order to pick up everything in the conversations.  Overall FLCL is something that won't be everyone's cup of tea and you'll either love it or hate it but if your looking for something that is rather out there then look no further than FLCL.,33069,708,2019-04-13 21:35:40

absolutely 100% the reason i love anime. new ideas new formats of telling the story. even if it doesn't make much sense at the time it will when you watch more of it. the total pattern of the story will emerge in time and even if you don't like it you have to respect the effort they put into making it.,33078,713,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,33084,718,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Unique anime which first in my list is deserve such a low rating. This anime is really hard to understand understand how could that be allowed? Fenomenal experience because anime consists of six episodes only but It lasts an eternity.,33085,719,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hmmm I almost feel bad rating this bad boy since I didn't actually finish it but I'm going to go against my better nature and do it anyway.  If you're a fan just stop reading now because you'll probably disagree with me in a hundred different ways.  If you're not then just begin by understanding that most people seem to find FLCL the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Personally I'd rather have a piece of sliced bread over a boat load of FLCL box sets.,33086,720,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was a very good yet short anime. i've recomended it to many people and i recomend you watch this if you like robots fighting and strange things,33087,721,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mister Walrus Reviews FLCL!,33091,723,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Long story short FLCL is simply a masterpiece.  The animation isnt bad and varies quite often for great effect (particular the manga-style scenes which are superb).  The Pillows (who perform all music in the show)  are a fantastic band who I have listened to extensively since watching this show for the first time.  Each character is unique and Naota's voice overs are extremely good at gaguing story progress and character development.  The biggest let down of this series for me is its length.  There was so much development in the 6 episodes that is is truly a shame though well concluded.,33094,724,2019-04-13 21:35:40
FLCL is a must see for anyone and everyone. Not only that it should be seen more than once.,33095,725,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: The story for FLCL  is completely insane and for the most part pointless not bad mind you but mostly a background thing.,33108,730,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fooly Cooly was an anime you had to pay very close attention to or you wouldn't get it at all.Either way I thought it was confusing and just random.It was also a short anime so not many events occur.What I really didn't get was the romance.I mean one second in this series he's with his brother's girlfriend.Then he's with haruharuko.If that's her name.(correct me if I'm wrong)But most of all the ending I think is boring.It doesn't even explain all that much.Remember this is my opinion.Don't like it then deal with it.,33113,731,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Uncontrolled frenetic spastic anime. When it's done you'll feel like someone worked you over with a lead pipe but you'll be smiling through your broken teeth. If you like wild rides this one's a hoot!,33114,732,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Furi Kuri certainly is 6 episodes of an Seinen Sci-Fi random WTF-just-happened kind of anime. While it is highly praised I'll say it now this anime won't be to everyone's tastes. It can also be difficult to understand and there is no obvious coherency to the story. Most would find it too boring. It's a refined taste like Whiskey hence why it is a Seinen. It's like Marmite you either love it or you hate it. Despite being part of the target audience I didn't enjoy it initially. Did it get any better?,33115,733,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had been watching a lot of gory and heavy anime as of late so I thought I would take a change of pace and go for a nice harem school life sort - you know just to sit and enjoy. ‘Bonjour’ was just what I needed to clear my mind before I delved into darker and murkier waters again. And with the series having just finished up this last friday it made it easy to binge watch it.,33144,750,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I watched about half of Gantz I didn't mind the violence or sex by its self. But I thought the whole show was basically a joke it was like a mixture or parody of the things I hate about shitty anime.,33188,769,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,33190,770,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched the first four episodes and had to put it down. The gore is very graphic but also cruel. Thinking on it I have never seen any movie or TV show so sadistic before. Hacking limbs off then making them beg for mercy almost killing them letting them get away then repeat. It makes me sick.,33191,771,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Awful just awful . Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Horrible characters and even worse story. Just don't. Don't. Do not. You have been warned.,33192,772,2019-04-13 21:35:40

What is this and how do you dare compare it to Elfen lied???,33194,774,2019-04-13 21:35:40
GANTZ has a great idea for a plot then falls flat on it's face. The idea of what happens after death makes many appearances in anime and it's not new that the main character dies right out the gate and then has to somehow get their lives back. This game of survival (between dead guys and a big boobed lady. Oh and a dog. How's he going to win?) seemed promising. At some point in the anime either because it passed the manga storyline or for no reason the anime strays from the manga. That's also when it started to be obviously bad to me.,33195,775,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm not dead well provided I don't die…Confuse you well if this show wasn't so wellwritten it would confuse any living creature. Minus the constant reoccuring needless sex and nudity that genuinely has just been placed in for the sake of fan service this show was fantastic. The main character makes you want to impail yourself on a stake with his perverseness...but he grows up towards the end. and I really wanted this series to continue because the concept in itself is excellent. I recommend a watch just to know if im retarded (sorry if you are),33196,776,2019-04-13 21:35:40
More tears than blood in an anime where every 2 minutes someone gets violently torn apart is never a good sign. While the general idea behind this anime is somewhat interesting i really can't find any good points behind the characters and how they interact with each other their surroundings and their foes. The constant crying and screaming about NO I DONT WANT TO KILL TO SURVIVE ALAS POOR YORIK just makes everyone seem way too oversensitive and turns this thing into a bad melodrama for sobbing cry babies.,33197,777,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Bonjour à tous et bienvenue pour une nouvelle review en Francais !,33200,779,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm sure if you've read any other reviews on GANTZ you know that people's opinions on this show are mixed.... and they have every reason to be.,33201,780,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was advised to just watch the first 21 episodes or so and pick up the manga from 136 i think? I havent seen the filler arc so i cant comment on it but ive heard a lot of complaints. Anyway I really like the story the concept the dark overtones and the nothing is sacred attitude. I love anime where no one is safe. [minor spoiler maybe?] even a main character can be killed off.  The whole theme of there not being good guys or bad guys the questions of morality brings a pretty deep story with a large helping of blood and gore. oh and boobs are awesome too,33203,781,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,33204,782,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let me explain a little my friend threw this on my harddrive I knew nothing about it other than it had some noteriety. My other friend and I were hanging out and he wanted to watch some anime we started it and finished all of it that night and the next day we couldn't stop watching. Also note this anime is for more mature audiences has nudity and lots of blood/gore.,33205,783,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you think that the SAW-movies are excellent philososphical thinkpieces that explore the base nature of man then the Gantz Anime is for you.,33206,784,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Stupid characters. Long convoluted and drawn out story. And... *SPOILER ALERT* The ending has no real resolution and it makes no flipping sence. ,33213,787,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just story cant create sth good to like to watch.Characters are so weak.The main character is a tearful baby and mumbling just  not my fault  all the anime and of course the manga.If you like sth bleach type or one piece type - hero  animes - you will hate this while watching and reading - a coward hero - doesnt feel good at all.And though this a manga/anime the cold people or I may mean - a full of stupid people filled the cities and towns made me bored.Just watching everything and dying like sheets.So generally I think this series as very boring...,33215,788,2019-04-13 21:35:40
STORY,33217,789,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As per custom it's required for me to talk about the ending even if it's right at the start of the review. In the form of a poem I heard long ago; It sucks. I've heard how bad it was and had a choice of leaving Gantz with fond memories of the second-to-last arc's ending and heading to the manga or forging on despite warnings of the anime's ending. I choose the second route and got the bad ending with no save file to go back and take the route to the good ending.,33219,790,2019-04-13 21:35:40

GANTZ was a very... good series if your into this kind of anime,33225,794,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Strange that although I rated the individual parts of this anime only average I'd consider the anime to be quite good. It was an interesting concept though I guess not very unique. I found myself getting annoyed with the characters though; they focused on their internal dialogue for far too long.,33226,795,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,33228,796,2019-04-13 21:35:40
GANTZ is a unique anime to say the least. It makes me question a lot of things. I would say its seinen but it feels like it was aimed at adolescent boys. At first I hated it being so shocked but the story just kept on getting better. The second half has an amazing turn of events I didn't see things coming. The story gets pretty intense. It is shockingly explicit going beyond what I've seen in an anime. Elfen Leid was more reasonable than GANTZ and I loved Elfen Leid. After the first few episodes I was thinking a more graphic version of Kick-Ass. It grew on me in a similar way that Elfen Lied seemed initially shallow but later turned out to be awesome. There is excessive mature themes including violence and gore on the level of Elfen Leid. I can kinda understand why some people would say this is like Elfen Lied but I didn't agree. Elfen Lied had a different more sensible atmosphere while this anime is more gritty and could be an 80s Hollywood movie. But afer watching it all especially the end I'd say the comparison to Elfen Lied is fair but this is different in many ways. Should you watch this? If you don't get easily offended and can look past bullshit for an interesting story then go ahead. Or you could watch the more tasteful live action movie for less time and less offensive crap. Also before you read this review please note that I hate ecchi and any nudity and explicit content that is present for no valid reason.,33231,797,2019-04-13 21:35:40
GANTz was a pretty good anime episode 15 was almost complete fan service containing 2 sex scenes.,33232,798,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overall Gantz is a good series that had potential to be great. Theoncept behind it is very interesting and it raises good questionsbout the human condition such as what a man alone can do against theoncensus or how to handle your sexuality when it differs from the normeven if at times in this show the weird fetishes are portrayed as normal ). Gantz falls short of being a better series as it loses somef its intensity and creativity towards the early middle.,33238,801,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The initial premise was extremely intriguing and I thought that it would make a really good story that would easily last for 12 episodes. Unfortunately the initial premise dwindled away after about the fourth episode along with most of my intrigue in the series. I think that brought down it's score immensely because once they lost focus of the creative and imaginative story it just became your average moe harem.,33248,809,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,33254,811,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The animation is great the characters are nice. At the beginning the story is full of potential. Well for me this is a good example of fiasco. By the third episode it becomes a typical soft womanizer story for twelve years old viewers. There is so much kawaii scenes that it becomes boring and the girls can't barely speak correctly because they are so incredibly shy in a not-so-cute-anymore way. Still the characters are interesting so thats why i gave a 5 on 10.,33255,812,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's a cute series with witty dialogues and somewhat cool male lead. By cool I mean the fact that he can actually talk back to all sorts of weirdoes (which the majority of the cast seems to consist of). The plot revolves around him moving to a city going to high school and living with his aunt. The aunt happens to have a daughter who thinks she is an alien. The girl is his age and she rather quickly becomes attached to him. During the course of the series the guy also becomes friends with two female classmates who appear to be romantically interested in him (but he fails to notice it 90% of the time).,33258,813,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I saw this anime for the first time I remember enjoying it a lot more. In fact I had rated it 4/5. After watching it for the second time I'm not saying it's bad but nothing special either maybe just a bit more than average. It's a romantic comedy / harem / slice-of-life / moe and while the comedic part is pretty good the romance not so much. ,33263,815,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY for Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko was not what I was expecting - and I think it is because of this that I didn't enjoy it much.  The premise seems very interesting: a young girl was gone for half a year and then was found in the sea with no recollection of what happened.  Now she thinks she's an alien and walks around with a futon wrapped around her upper body.  Uh - sounds awesome!  But the execution of this anime was poor and soon this turned into a typical harem anime.,33266,816,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i am writing this review from cell so i apologize for the sloppyness but i had to write something for this show bc i just finished the latest episode (8) and decided its time people know about this show. i will instantly say that the character development is right on par with the great clannad even. only 8 episodes in and i really feel a strong relationship with the characters and cant wait till each episode to see the different individual relationships blossom. the writing is excellent and you really get a sense of where the show is going while still being pulled along enough to the point of,33273,820,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The first season is outstanding but unfortantly not all second seasons turn out like Clannad After Story. I don't think I've ever been so disapointed with an anime before; tha main plot of Spice and Wolf from the first season was Lawrence taking Holo up north with threats and stuff along the way now that worked in the first season because they were constantly on the road and we saw the lovely countryside and everything else this world has to offer yet this season thinks it's wise to keep everything self contained in two towns because there's only two story arcs. Also the main charm of the first season was the interactions between Holo and Lawrence so what does this season do? 4 whole episodes of them separted why what's the point? They can't develop their relationship when they are seperated and it was very annoying. The last arc was fine and the ending was very sweet but there's alot wrong here and it just get's boring - season 1 is sooooooo much better and that just makes this even more heartbreaking.,33278,823,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,33279,824,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Absolutely amazing show the characters are so loveable and some can truly make you despise them. The show is mostly in a medieval fantasy like world where a peddler named Kraft Lawrence meets a strange companion a fox girl named Holo who was a fox deity of the harvest. She is a very interesting character and very loveable for being a bit sarcastic witty and a bit of an alcoholic. I'm the type of person who mostly likes fighting and not romance but this show was something I couldn’t shy away from. Some parts are about the economy of their world and they may bore you but don’t shy away from the show completely its not entirely economy based. The openings are very well done same as the endings. The music adds onto the medieval like atmosphere. Holo and kraft are kind of like oil and water at some points but that’s what seems to pull them closer to each other. I honestly stayed up very late at night sometimes watching because I couldn’t stand waiting to watch later. Finale is a bit abrupt and being there is no 3rd season (hopefully there will be) its kind of a downer but that just leads you to think of your own parts. I honestly loved this show and if there was a third season announced I would probably squeal loudly. Highly recommend this show.,33281,825,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I will say this: Spice and Wolf II does Spice and Wolf justice. I like the opening and ending themes a bit less but every good word I said about Spice and Wolf holds true here as well. If you liked Spice and Wolf then you will feel the same about this - and in this case that is a glowing recommendation.,33282,826,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'll have to admit I do fall for the cutsey parts of this anime but the constant replays of the same scenes make it kinda lame.  Even though the UNLOCK HEART part was cool at first it kind of got a bit annoying (not to offend any pokemon fans) like jesse and james' catchy poem they say before they get blown off somewhere in shabalaba land.  Anyhow the whole egg portraying the your inner child's soul is cute and interesting.  The reason I continue watching this cutesy anime of amateur love is luckily from the artists' awesome creations of the CUTE LITTLE SHUGO CHARAS.  Nonetheless I do enjoy the varied adventures Ayu goes on especially Ami's cute wannabe Utau sing-along songs.  The thing that keeps me on edge is the sexual attraction Ikuto always emits.  I MEAN COME ON GUYS not to be hentai or anything but that episode where he was JUST ABOUT TO  PUT HIS KEY INTO THE HOLE  and Ayu screaming  NO IM SCARED  LOL seriously; ( I know I have a sick mind if you know what I'm talking about) but I TOTALLY thought that had some sexual representation.  Anyhow I am interested in what the hell this dam embryo looks like and what everyone's wish is.  However i did feel the characters had interesting aspects.  ESPECIALLY NADESHIKO; WHAT....A....SHOCKER...  and of course Tadase.  At least he isn't just A GOODY TOOSHOO.  I loved his outburst of his wannbe king-a-like.  Other than that I find it interesting how Ayu battles her inner self image and tries to find her true identity through her shugo charas.  If your looking for some nice school like stories and innocent romance with cute adventures and chibi figures as well as subtexual representations; shugo chara is definitely for you. :),33320,841,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Definitely on my Top 10. Nice anime full of action suspense and drama. Nice soundtracks smooth fighting scenes and more. Every episode is awesome. The ending left me kind of clueless though but at the same time I enjoyed all of it. Trust me I dropped this once thinking it was lame because of the slow start but then picked it up again and it blew my mind. 9.5/10 for me and even though I hate to say this this is one of those anime that doesn't need a second season to prove themselves cause their first season was a master piece.,33342,850,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So it's been a long time since I did my last review and I felt I should do one series that I got incredibly hyped up on at first thought this series had the potential to go somewhere got excited and really intensely passionate about this series...only to have it fall through the roof like so many others such as Attack on Titan Sword Art Online and the most recent Black Bullet. Wait sorry I lied...let's be honest Black Bullet was never really going anywhere in the first place. ,33349,854,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The Irregular at Magic High School follows a trend of LN adaptations in which the source material leaves little to be expected from the anime. This particular product however breaks the mold in spectacular fashion with a memorable plot relatable characters and a fresh take on the highschool setting.,33354,857,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ok this an anime for those who like their tech and the detail that goes with it. There have been a lot of mixed reviews around this one but I am fan and really enjoyed it.,33357,858,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,33362,861,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The Irregular at Magic High School is a slight twist on the modified high-school drama. While the series first few episodes do a good job of pulling you in with its expansive world and detailed magic system it doesn't do much when it actually has your attention. The episodes leading into the middle of the season are bogged down by mostly pointless pontificating by the series many cookie cutter characters.,33363,862,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It is a great anime I who had read the Light Novels though that it would be a rip off or simply all over the place but it ended being a surprisingly good retelling of what actually happened in the Novel version.,33366,863,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There's nothing really remarkable about this series other than the seriously OP main character.  And even THAT is not really explained.,33371,864,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This one started very well good amount of action and fighting. but half way through it got very slow and hard to watch. It picked up some pace at the end but still the story is unfinished like most of the animes.,33383,868,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,33387,869,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a anime about some 2 teenagers who go to a magic school. The magic school is of course bullies those who aren't good enough into a Course 2 placement which means they don't get as much as well Course 1. Though it seems like the Course 2 students are on par or even more useful then those in Course 1. Does that make any sense? Not Really. I don't even write reviews for anime but this one I feel like they screwed up.,33388,870,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Magic high was one I loved but expected a bit more than I got. It seemed to drag out in some places and go to quickly in others. So why did I rank it so high you ask? Because for some reason I cannot entirely describe I couldnt stop watching. Even during the parts that were less than exciting for some reason while it was on I was glued to the tv. The first episode seems to hint at things we don't get to see more in depth which drove me nuts but manage to hook me.,33389,871,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The anime has 3 arcs the first 2 arcs are awesome but the third arc and the ending was disappointing. The anime lacked the background story because of which you will not understand few thing. I really recommend people who like watch action packed anime this will be a worth watching anime and I believe the main character is sooo overpowered that he can beat Goku you will really enjoying watching the main character as he is as intelligent as L and more powerful than any character I have ever seen.,33390,872,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I would have loved loved this anime if it weren't for how slow the plotline went and the main character. The animation was beautiful as was the soundtrack but the main protagonist I just couldn't take him. The whole point of a story is to see a character get hurt grow and develop as a person. Otherwise staying static is fairly boring most of the time. Not only is he very god like but it makes him very gary sue. Every time he got hurt he would just heal himself. If something had been fixed about this and the way they executed the story slowly I probably would have enjoyed it more.,33391,873,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Set in a post-WW3 world where magicians can use special devives to cast magic the anime is very promising in first episodes.,33392,874,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I feel like this anime had so much potential but within 26 episodes it felt like nothing happened. I kept sitting through it hoping the next episode would bring something of substance but it seemed to fall short. ,33393,875,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Pros: I liked the Deadman Wonderland manga and this anime... was based on that very manga.,33414,880,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As thoroughly disturbed as I was after watching the first 10 minutes or so of this anime I definitely have to give it my respect for its story content and the feeling of uncertainty that it leaves you after every episode.  Many of us have watched shounen anime where the main character has a goal in mind and by sheer willpower or hard work it always works out in the end.  But Deadman Wonderland is different it is at almost the complete opposite end of the spectrum because not everything goes right for Ganta in this series and he's not a strong character but a determined character nonetheless.  It's odd that I'm praising the fact that not everything goes right in this series because just when you think:  OH OKAY IT'S SAFE TO LOOK NOW  that's the moment when it slaps you in the face with shocking/inappropriate/stomach churning/flat out messed up stuff.,33415,881,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The Premise is good but the execution is extremely poor one original story that turn into a simple and glitchy story without emotional effect after the second episode in the end nothing original remain. Impressive how they can make a twist like this remembers Mirai Nikki just one chance to dance a good promise and a gigantic failure in the execution.,33419,883,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Deadman Wonder is an amazing anime. In fact my biggest complaint is that it was not long enough!

Strange things can happen to a person when they're in prison so the general rules of thumb are to keep a low profile stay out of the way of other people and avoid dropping the soap in the shower. For the inmates of Japan's only privately owned prison (which for some reason is run as a theme park and is built on Ground Zero of the Great Tokyo Earthquake) the ablutive antics of their fellow  guests  are the least of their worries especially when the warden takes the term  punishment game  to a whole new level. The stage is set. The  Running Man  style collars are on. The next event is a lethal variation of Takeshi's Castle.,33443,890,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Story: This story is silly and gory. It's silly because of the theme park aspect; gory becuase of the prison. I understand why both sides are really necessary. When we just see gore all the time we become desensitized to it. What happened in G-Block and the prison part of Deadman Wonderland is awful and sick and the contrast of the happy-go-lucky theme park sitting on top of that hell-hole (can I cuss in reviews? I'm going for it) is shocking. I feel like there are so many plot twists I shouldn't say anything else. ",33447,892,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:  To summarize the plot with no spoilers it's about a boy named Ganta who is framed for brutally killing his entire class and sent to the prison  Deadman Wonderland.   While he is there he is seeking out the person who actually killed his friends.  The holes in this story were so numerous I would have mistaken it for a construction site.  The practices within the prison are so inhuman there is no possible way to have kept it all a secret from the government who would shut them down (they were selling tickets to the public.)  Not to mention the prisoners are somehow able to stage massive attacks on each other and everyone seems to just look the other way while they bring down large sections of this claimed high security prison.  The list of flaws in this show is endless however I still enjoyed it.  The plot was so unbelievable I eventually just accepted it as  and enjoyed the very bizarre world that was set up before me.  I was disappointed at the ending though.  I could tell it was being set up for another season.  Yet whether they will get it or not depends partially on the demand of the fans.  As far as I hear a second season isn't looking all together promissing.,33490,907,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Honestly I really loved this anime watching through the episodes. I loved the plot and I loved some of the characters' backstories as well as the tragedies that led on to it. Action/fight scenes were amazing and I thought the whole concept of the Deadman thing was really cool. I was also very surprised at what happened in the first episode. Some of the characters were a bit iffy in my opinion and could have been done better. Also how it ended really made me upset. ,33508,917,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This started off really awesome and strong in the beginning it just suckes you right in to wanting to know more and more but  then after so many episodes it starts going whack and in differ directions and the ending ahh man while im not gonna spoil it for you but i will tell you I was very dissappointed on the overall of this anime series. The best part was the beginning and when ever their was a fight in this series. Story was just all over and every where and alot of it was dumb. Beginning was a strong point then leads you on to a big not making sense dissappointed anime.,33522,925,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This  Anime really is like no other. It has horror gore ecchi and even comedy. Some thing for everyone you could say. It is most definitely one of my favourite anime for the pure reason that it is unique brutal and not too long. It tells the story of a fourteen year old boy named Ganta who is wrongly accused of murdering his entire school class. For  crime he is sentenced to death at the one and only Deadman Wonderland prison. This isn't any ordinary prison it is also a tourist attraction making money from gladiator style ''games'' starring the prisoners themselves. As the series goes on you learn more and more about the sinister background to this odd organisation.,33523,926,2019-04-13 21:35:40

AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,33525,928,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was pretty bad BUT i read the manga so my expectations were higher than most.  I feel like that made me able to keep up a lot more because honestly this was probably the most confusing anime I've ever seen without my backstory from the manga. I couldn't believe how much they left unexplained and characters that were building slowly that never amounted to anything.  The dub was pretty good it's one of the only animes I've ever watched in english however I thought Shiro's voice was possibly the most annoying I've ever heard in an anime which kind of ruined it because she was the main character really.  Though it didn't feel like it.  The main characters felt like Nagi and Karako.  I think more time should have been spent on Shiro's story definately.  However.  thinking about how I would perceive the ending and Shiro's prescence as twisted and mysterious instead of just weird to the point i was angry because it didn't make any sense.  SPOILER HERE. I think that having ganta stay with her instead of escape us knowing what she's done and who she is is a pretty awesome twisted ending for a short anime like this.,33526,929,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First off id like to say it is a relativly good anime. It has a very interesting plot that i would never of been able to think. There is only one problem i have with this anime and that is the entire  My entire class was killed . Just the thought of all my very own class mate's and friend all being killed and id be sentenced to death because of it. It slightly bothers me other than that its a very good anime in the action/comedy/ecchi genre. I give it an overall of 7/10 id make it higher but the entire  Friends killed  thing ruined a lot of the anime for me but its only a personnel thing. So if you know it wont bother you it should be an amazing anime!,33527,930,2019-04-13 21:35:40

this anime is a good romantic comdey with a hint of etchi but it has a good story plus it has good charter make up. there done verry well even though some could have been better. the animation could have been a little better b/c i thin it was kinda flat. the only thing i would have to say is i wish it was longer since im not that big of a fan of short anime and to b honest i think longer nime have better story lines.,33536,936,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is my first review and I'm still quite the newb when it comeso anime so it probably won't be incredibly intriguing or helpful. But I'veead a lot of reviews in my lifetime and I feel like this anime had a great amount of wasted potential and I just feel like I need to express my opinionbout it - especially in light of the generally positive reviewsatings and recommendations I've seen for it on the web.,33539,939,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sooo i just finished this anime and it had a decently sweet plot line that to a point really reminded me of Ano Natsu de Materru with the whole accident thing when they first meet and than the main female having to sacrifice her ability to be at earth to save the main guy put at risk. Another similarity happens to be the whole half alien and having their (Ichika and Mizuhou) father being the human. They also both where glasses. The main differnce is that While Mizuhou is a teacher in this anime and older (but probably not much due to Kei's standstill) Ichika is in the same grade as her love interest Kaito.,33544,944,2019-04-13 21:35:40
so i just finished please teacher and guess what? It wasn't too bad. I don't recommend watching the dubbed version because it's extremely gay. It makes things more awkward especially when you're watching an 18yr old kid having an affair with a martian it doesn't  feel  right...tee hee. anyhow I thought the storyline was fun and I never felt bored while i was watching it. Every episode had something important happening---although most of it being drama. But if you like the drama and love romance watch this. Don't expect any genuine laughs though i didn't find it all that funny. Maybe a smile here or there...,33545,945,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Here is another harem Type story with a guy being surronded by girls but only two are really interested in him.

Everything about this show is so average and so predictable. The characters are so silly and you just can't help but to laugh or facepalm at what happens on screen. The plot while a great idea but it isn't explored much and it's more just about ecchi and love triangles that don't even go anywhere. The animation and music aren't bad or good they are just average.,33581,964,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story 5/10,33602,968,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Such a disappointing anime. After hearing some positive thoughts about X I decided to give it a shot and the opening themes of Destiny/fighting fate sounded appealing and seemed as though they were going to be presented in an original thought provoking way. Here ends any true praise I can muster for X. While the animation and sound have no noticeable issues neither do they stand out characters are bland but the show attempts to convince you that they are deep and complex. The initial fight scenes featuring the protagonist make him out to be a harass yet as the show goes on he becomes less and less awesome and more whiney/weak and indecisive. In general this is an anime that begins fairly string but ultimately fails to deliver on the promises made early on. The fights are par at best the characters uninspired and the story shallow.,33603,969,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've never seen the movie version or read the manga. Kamui is the main character. He has powers and he returns to the city he grew up in as a kid. There he meets old friends Fuuma and his sister Kotori. We also meet a plethora of characters that will have their destinies intertwined. Their destinies will determine if the Earth will be cleansed of human's or if humanity will move forward. These characters have their powers as well. It's one side against another. The Dragons of the Earth who want a new Earth and the Dragons of Heaven that are for humanity. I understood this but I did't understand the whole point of it the plot was just there and it really never really explained why this and that was happening it was just happening. The tv series is 24 episodes long and it felt too short. There were too many characters and just not enough time for all of them and for the story to flesh out.,33605,971,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I loved the first season of Psycho-Pass in fact it is even my favorite anime of all time. I have rewatched it countless times and believe it is a show that transcends anime. You can imagine my excitement when they announced that a second season was coming. Unfortunetly my anticipation became to drop as I learned that Production IG would not be working on this season and was being replaced by Tatsunoko. Now I have nothing against Tatsunoko they're actually a really good studio but they aren't Production IG. Then I found out that Gen Urobuchi would not be returning this season and would only be there to assist as an advisor. The new man taking his responsibilities would be Tow Ubukata. I'm actually a fan of Ubukata especially for what he did with Mardock Scramble but he isn't on Urobuchi's level. So although both of these things were going to slightly hurt the production I still felt like the second season of Psycho-Pass should have still have been good right? Well Kinda...,33686,986,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'll write this review assuming the reader's already watched PP season 1. Season 2 is like the evolution of the first one rather than simply a sequel. It's darker grittier even more full of action intrigue and with Psycho Pass' usual strong social commentary. Definitely well-worth a watch (and a re-watch!),33692,991,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Though psycho pass 2 infuriatingly doesn’t even mention any events that transpired in season 1 until halfway through the season and it did leave some unanswered questions (ones that will hopefully be answered in a future season) those are my only complaints. The anime is impeccable not only in its philosophical questions and psychological theme but also in it’s to make you question everything the world yourself GOD? Akane is a badass that takes literally no shit from anyone and does what she wants and still gets away with it. The other characters are ok but really only in their interactions with her. She really steals the show and she should since she’s the main character. Sybil (justly named after the woman with multiple personality syndrome) is just an amazing concept to imagine and I wish that this show would take exploring it further. As the show progresses you continue to see just how flawed the system is only to have it update and improve itself after a major incident. This show does its job at making you think if you don’t like to think this is probably not the show for you but if you like the mysteries of society the human god the fine always moving line between right and wrong this anime is one of the best. WHAT COLOR ARE YOU?,33703,997,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I am going to make this extremely short.,33704,998,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A worthy sequel to the first season but felt a bit flat/forced towards the second half. Also only 13 episodes or so long.,33708,1000,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's too short!!!! The first season was 22 episodes. It's true that the first season had to introduce ALL the characters and the setting as well as explain things so it makes sense that it would be long (although I don't consider 22 episodes a long season or even close). The second season still had to introduce characters though because they got rid of at least half the characters in the first season! Unfortunately one of the characters no longer present is Kougami too. Anyway my point is this season was too short. Some parts of the story felt rushed too. The end didn't wrap up as neatly either. We never did really find out if the new inspector girl ever got a cloudy psychopass for even a moment even though mentioning her psychopass wasn't uncommon. She as well as several other characters were not developed as well either. I feel like I know quite a bit about the characters from the first season but not so much from this season. Even if it is a second season using the same setting and similar ideas from the first season 11 episodes is still too short especially if you mess around with the characters and their roles. IT'S TOO SHORT!!! I'm so tired of so many animes being so short except for the less interesting repetative cliche ones that end up on daytime american tv. (Yes I am aware I have a similar rant in the majority of my reviews). ,33709,1,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I went into this thinking the episodes were the usual lengthf most series OVAs but damn was I wrong haha. Overall I believe the timeength per episode was pefect for it’s length. This series has yet to fail men any way that I can think of. The drama is great the interactions are realnd go accordingly to my knowledge at least and most of all the relationshipetween Sachiko and Yumi was still building. Throughout these three seasonumi really has grasped how to handle Sachiko and it’s great as to how theynteract with each other now. Sachiko’s cousin Touka wasn’t as annoying eitherhe played a very good role and it seems she may be a potential souer for Yumi.,33724,5,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I found that while highly entertaining it did lack quality animation at some key pionts in the show.

Dragon Ball Kai is a rebroadcasting of Dragon Ball Z. Basically they're reducing the show from 300 to 100(ish) episodes. They're cutting out 'fillers' and less important scenes to follow the manga closer. They've also re-recorded all the voices and touched up the animation.,33759,26,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Absolutely the attack on titan type episode we know and love.  The second episode is truly hilarious (if you get it) and the third one isn't worth watching in my opinion it is akin to filler which is so not attack on titan.  One of their greatest strengths is the fact that there is absolutely no filler in this anime and they better not ruin that streak in season 2 that would be a disaster and would tell me they didn't try as hard with this season. ,33762,29,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one adorable tale of a little girl who tries hard no matter what is happening. Her dad is basically a mobster. Her mother a very uptight but tender lady yet this family does not live together because of inner difficulties. Suprise Suprise.

Cute girls sleeping monsters silly robot with a pinch of action...typical. It is enjoyable and you can grow to love the characters (considering the short 12 episodes). The story was nothing special and actually quite common in the world of anime. Two lucky boys find a pair of helpless cute girls in the middle of the woods and vow to protect them from danger. Personally i find those type of things quite stupid. The boy never met this girl before and after a single monster attack promises  never to let anything happen  to this girl.,33822,57,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Its alright...and that about sums it up. It feels a bit nostalgic like an anime from they 90's which includes all of the cliches and problems of back then. The sound and animation is standard I suppose. Most the characters I can't stand the main character has nothing going for him and when something shows up for him to protect he suddenly gains the motivation to spend every once of energy forever protecting her because she most obvious needs it. Its mostly drama with some action between huge monsters and the hyper powered main character. Anyways its okay feel free to skip.,33823,58,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I remember watching this anime before. A long long time ago. I can't really say when or how lol or even how old I was. But back then I didn't even know what anime was. I really like the idea behind this anime though. It made me smile. Funny that I would start watching it again yesterday and finish off today. The 25th of December. The whole anime was very moving I have to say though not enough to lead to tears maybe another time. But at the very same time watching it was a little like replaying a dream... crazy huh? In time I can't say I have ever watched it but I have you know?,33826,60,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Solid anime adaptation of a manga. Good amounts of action to break up a rather quick paced romance. Nice call back from 90's anime. Kinda short though. If you want the full story I'd suggest reading the books.,33843,69,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY of 3 x 3 Eyes while having the potential to have been wonderful turned out to be a flop.  It in my opinion was poorly presented and left the viewer feeling a little bit blank and bored.  I thought that this whole him being her Wu and turning her human so that she could forget her past would be pretty interesting - sure it was a bit cliche but any anime can get over a cliche as long as it is well presented and thought out and I just didn't get that feeling with this anime.,33845,70,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series has a very unusual mix of shonen slice of life comedy and romance. Centered around two young inspiring mangakas (people that want to make mangas for a living) and their love intrests this series shows a fairly inspirational plot line filled with many a ddetermined young (and sometimes not so young) man.,33868,88,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is an anime that is a bunch of fillers but all the characters are in chibi form.  Some random things happen from Dodge-balls that are thrown at supersonic speeds Green talking Ballon animals an alien that doesn't show emotions playing H-games an esper wearing a mountain suit all the way to our beloved Haruhi in a dog suit telling Mikeru to jump through a burning ring of fire just to make Kyon go to sleep.  There are so many random things happening and the voice acting is phenomenal.  If you enjoy the sight of cute chibi anime characters living life to it's fullest (by Haruhi's standards) you will love this anime.,33872,92,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Soul Eater is like one of those frusterating things that you want to succeed but I watched it and found it rather middling. At first it was pretty solid and you got nothing but good vibes in the early episodes but then Medusa came along and well things went rather downhill from there. The pacing became rather awkward. There were a few pointless fillers added in about some lame sword named excalibur and all he did was berate others and go into long philosophy speeches that took up an entire episode. The animation on the other hand was pretty consistent easily rivaling that of Eureka Seven and Fullmetal Alchemist (other BONES work). The ending was the worst of it. It ended on pretty much a cliffhanger with little satisfaction. The characters are pretty mixed to poor. First you've got Maka (who's pretty much a female Ichigo Kurosaki) then you have Black Star (who's pretty much another Naruto) and finally Death the Kid who is obsessed with symmetry. His constant bickering about symmetry gets old really fast. ,33885,103,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I won't lie Soul Eater start like a pretty average shonen show. It looks like another generic adventures/action/comedy anime but after introduce you to the characters you'll soon discover a beautiful show with good writting and character development. Friendship and courage are always two themes that always appears in this kind of shows but soul eater make it look any thing but artificial. The story ends up being more original the characters feels real and relatable acting like they woud act with the ages and the personalitys the creators give them make them never look acting out of character. The humor is really funny with typical situations in real life like exams or homework  and the plot is really meangniful. You grow to care for the characters and there're episodes and moments someone could even cry.,33886,104,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ahh soul eater in all the anime's i've ever watched nothing has been able to beat it to this day... It's that good. The manga is very eichii but the anime isn't just so you guys know. So i'll jump right into it this time the animation (if any of you have read the official review) has weird angles of shooting and that at times makes the characters look disproportional but i believe it's all part of the style of the anime having that whole horror theme to it the weird camera angles only makes it right gives it a 'twisted' feel. The fight choreography is amazing the way they animate the fighting scenes if very different although it's quick moving it doesn't make you dizzy the movements are detailed as well smooth.,33902,109,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I recommend this anime to everyone since it really is amazing. it does have violence and bad language but apart from that it has an amazing story and some of the characters are hilarious especially black star and death the kid. my favourite pair is soul and maka since I reckon they would make a cute couple. I think that black star and tsuibaki would be cool together and also kid and liz. I also think that stein and maria are amazing and should have so many babies but that may just be me :3.,33905,110,2019-04-13 21:35:40

While the series scores high for animation characters and sound it's story suffers toward the end. It has a great storyline until the last six or so episodes where the crew seemed to unanimously say  What the hell who cares anymore? It's almost over anyway.  and then proceeded to throw any passing thought into the plot. (A problem that even some characters (Kid for example) seem to admit within the series.),33912,117,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Although I am not really into this genre I really liked Soul Eeater. The story is of a typical shounen naruto style but it's not too long. Animation is pretty neat with some spicy details I enjoyed. The characters might not be realistic but they can make you laugh. If you like this shounen style anime I'll highly recommend Soult Eater,33914,119,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I know there is nothing that is perfect and me giving Soul Eater a 10/10 does not mean that its a perfect Anime but it was really really great! I loved it from the start.The Animation was so different than I have ever see before. I like how it has a dark and creepy tone to it. But at the same time I loved the comedy in it. The story itself is ok. But it makes up for it with the characters. Each character had its own personality and you kind of grew with them. The music was great too. The right music was played at the right times especially during fight scenes. Anyway not to drag this on but if you like comedy action and have a bit of a dark side Soul eater is the Anime for you!,33915,120,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a fairyly good anime. It has a good story line to it. I like that they are mostly sticking to one main goal and only go off on to little side stories. The animation of this anime is very good considering the year that is was made in. Also the characters have very good detail to it along with the scenery to it. I like some of the voices of the characters this anime also has good music to it. I like most of the characters in this anime because they are really awesome people and also some of them are real badasses. So overall this is a really good anime. ,33916,121,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Honestly I tried to watch this one because it was rated rather highly and people I've heard talk about it had good things to say but frankly there was only one character that didn't get on my nerves completely and the rest of the show was completely pointless repetitive and idiotic.,33929,122,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Seriously this anime is just too cool for its own good. In a bizarre Halloween-esque world students at the DWMA are seperated into two groups. One of the groups are weapons students who have the ability to transform into any kind of weapon. The other group are meisters the students who wield these weapons. Each meister has their own weapon and the partners must work together to kill 100 kishins. If they succeed the weapon could then turn into a Death Scythe which is wielded by Lord Death himself. The anime focuses on three partnerships: Maka and Soul Black Star and Tsubaki and Death the Kid and his twin pistols Patty and Liz.,33934,124,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay what to say about this anime...well first I'll start off by saying this series is a must watch for fans of anime. The art style is unique and the characters are very easily enjoyed and somewhat relatable. The story is good and keeps you wanting more with each episode and leaves you with the  what next  feeling as well. Basically in this anime you get alittle of everything from a great plot/storyline to funny characters to the wonderful animation. I don't know what else to say about the series besides that I loved it and its on my recommended list for sure!,33969,132,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutely loved it! What made me market to story segment as a nine is because of the last episode. I felt like it ended too quickly. Maybe because it was so good I lieutenant it to end? Overall 10/10 for me!,33975,133,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Far far away... There's the school of Shinigami. In that school there's weapons and meisters. In fact weapons are those children who can transform to weapons (In fact like a gunsword...) and meisters can hold them and fight with them. Weapons can eat beat enemies souls. Weapons destination is to eat 99 regular souls and 1 witch soul. So the story began when Maka and Soul again fought enemie...,33983,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Loved this anime soooooooo much. great characters and plot line. It always kept me interested and never seized to amaze me. The only problem i saw was the pacing of the show. It was very fluffy at times and battles seemed to go on for awhile because of them talking. Although that was a big problem it was over ruled by the great characters ( Crona being my personal fav) and interesting story. You could relate to some of the characters wheather you were a cool kid (soul) or a son of a rich man (death the kid) Or a depressed loner( crona). altogether it had relatable characters and made you want more. I would give this a 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10. definitley should watch.,33985,139,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Soul Eater is to me a tale of disappointment--and I'm not referring to the any statement the plot makes on this subject. The series itself squanders its otherwise great potential. It could have been a unique brilliant anime...instead it is merely mediocre.,33986,140,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Critic’s Log - Earthdate: October 31 2013. Review #65: Soul Eater,33988,141,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:  I loved the story line.  It always kept me entertained and i couldn't wait for the next episode to start.  Only thing that they could have changed is add more about the side character and not just show them here and there.  They did though go into the back stories of the character and you see where each of them came from and why they act as they do.,33993,142,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of my favourites but it dissapointed me with it's ending. SPOILER- I mean  how in the world can you kill a Kishin with your fist! Death the Kid had those motherfucking awesome and badass guns and he couldn't kill it but Maka with her bare fist.....-End of SPOILER- The animation is great from my point of view and the characters...I must say it those creepy faces are the best part.( also the Excalibur reaction ) But I didn't like that Crona was such a cool character and by the end she's soo scared. Overall it's a must see but the end of the story is pretty dissapointing. ,33994,143,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Being one of the most timid people ever to exist I am surprised that I even have the guts to make a review.,34006,147,2019-04-13 21:35:40
a near perfect show full of funny in jokes adn quirky characters that you cant help but fall in love with.  The story is full of information that drives the naritive and the few throw off episodes have a unique character added to the mix that has made more that a few people laugh at its mention.  The only thing hold this anime back is the cop out ending.  I meant seriously winning the finnal battle in that method after all the characters had been throught was just disgraceful.,34008,148,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really felt like Soul Eater left me hanging a bit.  The story was intriguing and kept me coming back to finish out the series but I felt like the character relationships weren't developed to their full potential.  I'm very much into anime for the characters so I was quite disappointed in that respect.  The meister/weapon relationships were explored some but despite a couple of very short romantic hints there was nothing despite the dozens of possibilities they had laid out.  Within the first 30 seconds of the series I was convinced Maka and Soul would get together.  Two seasons later nothing had changed except they'd gotten into a couple fights and recovered.  The plot wasn't wholely original but done well enough to keep me watching.  If that's all you care for you'll probably enjoy it.  Has a bit of a kiddie vibe but not enough to turn me off from it.  Animation is clean but not as detailed as I'm used to from most new anime.  All in all it was a decent show worth a try but I think the writers shortchanged the series.  It could have been better.,34009,149,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just liked the artistry and visuals that this anime had to offer. It had a Tim Burton Nightmare before christmas vibe or something like it in anime form. There was something so familar and cool about some of the animations that I had to keep watching it.,34012,150,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Soul Eater (^U^) aww Soul Eater your the only thing that made me into a otaku and make review but let me stop fan boying about it and get to the review by now almost everyone knows Soul Eater and say this is what Naruto should have been now as i speak at this time Naruto is still going but i do sometimes watch some of the long anime like Bleach Hitman Reborn and One Piece to see how it's going but Soul Eater is short like 51 episodes a little bit long but all good great animation and voice acting very good also i been hearing that Soul eater may get a second season but the only thing i could dig up was the opening and ending song,34016,153,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Just one more series that has left me feeling dissapointed and unfullfilled because of the  leave it to the viewer  kind of ending. Overall it was an enjoyable anime but the fact that they couldn't give the viewers the satisfaction of showing us the fates of the two most complex and central characters and how their releationship continued (or if they even survivived) left me feeling like I read through a novel and then suddenly realized that the last few chapters had be rippped out.,34036,161,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Witchunter Robin: This is personally my favorite anime. this anime has a lot toffer however I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AS A STARTER ANIME OR TO ANYONE WHO ISTILL NEW TO THE SCENE. This show is very deep and the characters areomplex and very well developed by the third episode you are already veryware of everyone’s personality and mannerisms. some of the characters are ait cliché but the main ones are unique. this show is very disconnected untilhe very end. each episode is of its own maintaining just subtle connectionsut enough for you to realize there are things going on behind the scenes. onenteresting factor of this show is how you don’t feel like you missed anything.any animes begin mid storyline or something like this; so three best friendsho are already big heroes get sent on a mission. you having already missedheir previous quests origins and such need to pick up that information laternto the series possibly through a wasted flashback episode. In this series youome in just as the main character’s story begins and you stick with themhrough it till the end. This show is sad and deep but every moment you watchou get more and more in touch with the characters inner thoughts and realizehy everyone feels the way they do.,34078,169,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Witch Hunter Robin is a 2002 anime created by Sunrise and distributed by Bandai. I first knew about it when it had aired on [adult swim] in 2004 however I did not actually give the show a full watch until years later. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it and it now has become a favorite of mine.,34085,170,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Have you ever heard the reviews for Final Fantasy XIII where they say  After the first 4 hours it's pretty good. ? Witch Hunter Robin is kind of like that. After you get past the first couple episodes you get a pretty good show. ,34086,171,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:,34088,172,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Having amassed all the necessary ingredients to make a grim action-packed supernatural thriller Witch Hunter Robin promptly drowns them in a shallow puddle of Not Much Happens. Rarely have I witnessed such pompous grey tone or such funereal voicing or so many shots of people staring mournfully at what must be the most fascinating middle-distance ever. Any spasms of action quickly default to some nondescript bad guy telekinetically hurling flower pots or dust bins and the protagonist Robin incinerating them in a puff of digitalised fire. But that’s not the worst of its sins - no that would be the fact that Robin and her secret organisation buddies are of no use to anyone in need of entertaining. So insufferably bland and middling are they that their long periods of pedestrian dialogue mostly drove me to do something else.,34096,173,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This on of a kind anime - as far as I know you won't find anything similar in spite of the numerous recommendations.,34100,174,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Higurashi is mainly popular because of the gore deaths. Considering that this is an OVA you might think it has something like that in it. Still this IS an OVA and since OVA's are mostly just random and don't have anything to do with the origional series I think this is a good example. Many people say it's not like Higurashi but let's be honest some parts in the origional series were just random club activities as well! Now let's review the episodes cuz they were all individual anyway:,34107,179,2019-04-13 21:35:40

My personal thoughts and feelings about this OVA are simple. I enjoyed it. You got to see the Mukami brothers also a little glimpse of the two new characters the Tsukinami brothers the founding brothers Carla and Shin. The OVA acted as a preview to the second season of the anime. You got to see who the Sakamaki Brothers react to their counterparts in the series.,34134,187,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kingdom is a crap show for twats. It is so bad that I would recommend rectal bleeding before I would recommend this series. The characters range from annoying to a training in homicidal tendencies for the viewer. The story is absolute generic garbage executed by syphilitic morons. The humor makes Naruto seem like an exercise in razor wit the dialogue will make you embarassed to belong to the same species that wrote it and character interactions are so bad that they would be funny if only you knew that it was supposed to be moving. Watching it will actually lower your IQ by one point for every ten minutes.,34168,194,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a terrible entry into the Gundams sereies G no Reconguista tries way to hard to be like the past series and fails terribly at maintaining a clear plot line. Character development if you can call it that is almost nonexistant because everyone changes sides and personality mutliple times throughout the show. The main character bellri is a great pilot but lacks any depth besides the fact that he doesnt want to kill anyone which he does anyways multiple times. One of the main problems I had with this series is the fact hat they kept adding new ships and factions every few episodes and ended up with a cluster f*&% of a battle that had no discernible sides you could follow. One minute a character is with the pirates/amerians and the next they blow up an entire amerian ship like its nothing. Following the blurred lines of loyalty we see multiple characters attempt to steal the g self throught clearly hostile action but with zero concequense when they reunite with the same people they tried to steal from.,34179,199,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When people think of 3D CG animation from the Far East they normally remember certain cut scenes from video games some of which are truly breathtaking works that combine imaginative storytelling with top notch cinematography. It's strange then that the skill and passion that goes into making these visual feasts is sorely lacking where the anime industry is concerned and the shows that have tried to walk the path of 3D CG have generally failed at capturing the attention of the audience.,34246,216,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hell of a blast from the past. I remember seeing this movie on PayPerView way back when it had recently come out. The cliche thematics of good and evil heart of the cards and that cheesy friendship theme has always brought the story down but I have to admit this whole series and card game (and all they entail) do have one hell of an imagination towards their monsters. I used to have a bunch of great cards when I play sucks that I gave them away like a total goddamned idiot. But as to the movie its a pretty good way to remember your childhood and feel like a kid again.,34259,220,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tsuyokumi -Moon Phase- is a 26 episode anime about vampires featuring action and comedy. Initial impressions were all over the place. I thought it was a horror then an ecchi and the intro really didn't help but it's none of those things. It's a decent watch actually feel free to try it. And that comes from someone who is very cynical and critical about anime. This actually made me laugh my face off it can definitely be funny. Bonus: No highschools. It can however be boring at times and there was much about this that infuriated me like the intro. And some aspects of characters and the story. But overall it is fine.,34292,230,2019-04-13 21:35:40
ok for starters the discription is true hazuki is the cutest vampire in existance but overall the character develupment is good story is  great and at one point made me cry would highly recomend to anyone looking for a good tear jerker but is also freaking funny at times so give it a try you wont regret it,34299,231,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"All visuals no plot thats it.

Even though 8inutes of shooting-action might sound exciting to some it was not.hey somehow managed to take away even the thrill of the battle. Watch this for the visualsnly if you must watch it.

I am the type of person that hates football / soccer because I am a rugby player. But this series is amazing I spotted what going to happen very early with out reading into it at all but it's got some nice twist and real medical phenonomeon that actually do happen. It's a gripping new series that quite honestly I look forward to more then the much bigger series that I have watched for year it's truly amazing and I enjot every minute of each episode all be them sad happy angry and sometimes frustating. Any sports fan and even those who aren't should seriously gives this a watch with an open mind.,34346,242,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I will simply say this:  If you're willing to finish watching this (It's bearable) then you'll find it's climax in Season 2.  And that alone made watching this garbage worth it.,34349,244,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Da Capo II is a 13 episode harem romance anime. Except it isn’t a harem at all. It’s set many decades after the original Da Capo which it tries to succeed. I’ll disclose my dislike of genres like harem and ecchi but the original Da Capo was actually a sensible one that stood out and I actually enjoyed it. High expectations of the sequel then not in the least expecting references to the original. Initial impressions were disappointing I almost thought I was watching the first Da Capo. Some of the characters are too similar and there’s a little bit of disappointment with the continuity. But as you remember the events of the original and watch more of this one finds it actually has a proper plot. I liked the actual conclusion the first Da Capo had and I even loved the surprising lack of harem in the second season thus this anime has a big plate to fill in a genre where it’s difficult to be decent like the original. But it manages to at least leave out the harem so a good start.,34350,245,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This series is basically a character introduction for the next season. The plot has nothing at all to do with the plot of Da Capo II second season. This is probably the worst of all the Da Capo shows. It would be worth watching only if you wanted to be familiar with the characters in the next season.,34358,246,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I must say I am absolutely astounded and slightly miffed as to how an anime like Mushishi is so highly regarded. I had read it was the anime of a lifetime and a must watch... I managed to stomach 5 episodes of nothingness then dropped it. This is saying a lot considering how I loved Kino's Journey which had no plot and was very episodic (she only stayed in a town for 1 episode then moved on).  ,34367,249,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,34382,250,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime came as a torrent of understanding being that I relied solely on the summary to provide any background before I watched this anime. I have to say that this anime was very enjoyable to watch though for some the style of story-telling may not be as conducive or entertaining as it is to others. This anime has reached one of the tops of my list of favorite animes to watch the other being Gintama and Akame ga Kiru and etc. I still would recommend this to anyone though. This anime has a timeless quality to it that still attracts me to it today.,34383,251,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:  Mushi-shi is such a lovely story.  It tells the story of a man named Ginko who seems to be keeping the balance between human beings and spirit-like beings called Mushi.  The show has a delicate charm about it.  It doesn't need to slap you across the face to get your attention.  I just found myself facinated by the loveliness of every episode.,34388,252,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mushishi is perhaps the greatest storytelling I've seen from any anime. This is not for some epic overarching plot but rather for a minimalist episodic approach that gives you new characters new settings new stories and new mushi to deal with each episode. Other episodic anime may have the tendency to lose your interest partway through but Mushishi is special in that each episode will leave you totally and completely satisfied.,34399,256,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mushishi is an anime that doesn't force you to keep watching. If you stop you lose nothing because there is really no plot. You can watch the first episode and then skip to the last and understand everything just fine. There is no main goal in the series and every episode is its own individual story that goes from start to finish in the 20 minutes it's given. However some things are the same in each episode: The main character Ginko and the Mushi.,34449,267,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Mushishi is one of my very favourite anime i've seen it a number of times and yet i still find it absolutely wonderful. The story characters and especially the soundtrack. Plenty of atmosphere tons of sad moments uplifting moments as well. The intro by Ally Kerr is one of the best intro's to an anime..,34451,268,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I really liked the story. I was rarely bored and almost always hooked. I'm pretty sure I finished the entire series in a period of three days. It had an extremely good plot and was very original. It wasn't a corny shoujo/romance where everything runs smoothly for the two characters in love and everything ends happily. No if that's what you're looking for then I recommend you stop reading this right now and go watch Kimi Ni Todoke or something. It's a very dramatic anime where the two characters in love face many obstacles. Not only the two characters in love but friends comrades you name it there's a whole shit load of drama between the characters. ",34488,279,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I personally like this anime but i would not rewatch it. It is fun enough to have seen once but for the time it was made (1995) it were pretty good animations. It is a story about a girl that is transported to another world through a book.

"When I started watching Occult Academy I did not expect much from it. The characters' art design also didn't appeal much to me the first time. But this is the kind of anime that has to be watched entirely to see what its real worth is about. Altough the first episodes lacks a bit of energy it gets better as it continues like A WHOLE LOT. It does it so much that I think this might be the best anime featuring one of the best endings I've seen this season and that means a lot. ",34519,291,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is good in the places that its good at.... meaning that there are times when its totally boring. The times that its good though are especially good and well worth watching the anime for. My advice is that if you get bored start skipping minutes untill it gets to the good parts and rewind if you think you missed something good. The ending is good just to let you know.,34525,293,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The plot follows the destruction of eartn in 2012 by aliens from outer space and the struggle of Bunmei who is send to find and destroy Nostradamus key in order to save his homeland.

Not great. The animation was not bad. The concept behind the story was okay but that's about as far as that went. I'd have rated this alot better if it weren't for the constant golden shower nonsense. Seriously... Every single episode at least one person urinates themselves after getting clubbed in the face with a baseball bat (and enjoying it).,25,309,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Honestly this show is probably one of my top 10 wtf animes that I have ever seen. That aside the sheer randomness of the comedy reminded me of a much more fanservice based version of FLCL which is probably the sole reason why I even remotely enjoyed this anime. The characters in and of themselves weren't unique however when they are paired together helped to make some pretty hilarious moments. As such I am giving this a 6.5/10,27,311,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had NO idea what i was getting into when i started this anime. All i knew about it was that it had ecchi in it. While yes i got ecchi.... LOTS OF ECCHI. I also recieved.... odd fetishes a very strange plot about shocking depressed people to make them  happy  again. A hentai show within this anime with very odd scenes... one male with a baseball bat.... boobs... lots and lots of boobs... naked ones... panties gallore.... and peeing.... wait what?,30,314,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really just your average ecchi with tons of fan service andnfortunately there will be another season. Too many unanswered questionsemained and the story was shaky at best. Getting hit by bats and then peeingith pleasure was one of the stupidest things this series had. The ecchi wasver the top and borderline hentai that’s for sure.,31,315,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie wasn't bad but it was kind of rushed. You don't really understand what's really going on unless you have watched the beyblade series. The movie was about an hour long and a lot of things happened in that hour. All the events that occured should have been shown in more detail and taken more time so as to the viewers don't get confused and get messed up. I would recommend this to many viewers but not everybody will like it.,43,318,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Durarara!! left me with wanting more. After season 2 came out I’ve become impressed on the overall quality of the show. It has definitely improved and the new characters are phenomenal (twins anyone?). My thoughts on this is pretty much the same as seaon one. Durarara is a unique show that contains various characters genres and storylines. Just about every episode focuses on a different character perspective despite the fact the main protagonist is Mikado. The great appeal of Durarara is its diverse and colorful mix of personalities of numerous characters. Overall this is by far one of the best animes I have seen in a while. I'd recommend it to anyone no matter what their tastes are since it has a bit of everything and an excellent cast of characters.,45,320,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Absolutely loved this anime it had me wanting to know what was going to happen next at the end of each episode. Having multiple relationships were really interesting but the one that kept me hooked was the relations revolving around Chihiro and Renji their story was deep and it gets you thinking about the lengths you would go for someone you loved. The other relationship being somewhat similar. Could you give up ther person you love and let them slip away? Another reason why this anime was so great is because it didn't have what I'd like to call A FML (F**k My Life) ending. This animes relationships were also more of something that could happen in the real world and not something like a magic alien girlfriend lands on your doorstep and for whatever reason is already madly in love with you. I ended up watching this anime all the way through to the end without a break. It was that good so if you like romance animes then this is a must watch. The opening song was also really catchy and fit well with the anime and the animation that went with it reminded me of the Persona (PS2 game) style. If I had to relate this anime to another one I'd say maybe Clannad or Kanon particularly because the artstyle is similar and the relations could somewhat be similar; dealing with memories or sacrifice for love. All in all I'd highly recommend this anime to anyone who likes a good romance anime.,58,333,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ef – A Tale of Memories (pronounced ‘eff’) is a short 12 episode drama romance anime based upon a light novel. I think (couldn’t find in English) but apparently there’s visual novel versions of it. A unique anime capable of invoking emotion and making the viewer think something I appreciate. Off the bat this was a rather serious yet sensible anime with a mature intricate plot. I must also add that I’d watched the first episode of this anime many years ago when I was sampling the first episodes of a variety of anime to see whether they were worth watching later (many years later!). This was one of the ones I looked forward to all this time I even got vibes of my favourite anime of all time Angel Beats. I will disclose my dislike for ecchi harem and shoddy romance relevant in a later bit.,62,337,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well I thought this was pretty good overall but in comparison to the first season this was kind of a step back. I mean the animation was pretty good although (there were a few corner cuts) and the dub is amazing but it falls short with the characters. Most of them were one dimensional retards who's only purpose was to shoot everything on sight. The pacing was sloppy because they drug out some of the planning so we hear more talking than shooting. The redeeming quality is that this anime has some killer sound effects and they sound more realistic than other anime.,68,343,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The second part of The Black Lagoon. They say the second is the charm but in this case both the first and the second is the charm here. Black Lagoon happens to stay at the top with the stunning visual effects and the story. Yet again as the first season of the Black Lagoon the sound seems to be slightly off and some what slow either depending on the site itself; or the episode. You still feel the same old same old but you still find that intensity of the show itself being rather entertaining and full of life. The characters are the same but with a new twist that makes you want to watch more. I enjoyed the anime and I hope that you the reader of my reviews enjoys the anime too. ,69,344,2019-04-13 21:35:40

OK before you judge a book by its cover and just say I'm throwing this rating around lightly JUST WAIT. I know alot of people say this anime resembles a Cowboy bebop that is simply less good. (A side note: Cowboy Bebop is my favorite anime of all time),79,352,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If ever there was an anime that depicted atmosphere of the criminal underworld warts and all it's this one. 12 episodes for the first season and another 12 for the second season this anime is full of violence guns swearing explosions and... great story. This isn't the mindless action anime it seems it has a lot behind it especially since the story revolves around a rather ordinary character in the dangerous criminal world. I got major western (non-anime vibes) here. I'd expect this anime to be popular among many with varying tastes. Not many anime show crime as well as this one. If you don't like the average anime if you like good anime if you like action or even if you're a fan of unique story then this anime is for you. I expected well of this anime a bad thing since high expectations never bode well. Was this as great as I predicted? Read on to find out.,80,353,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There isn't much in a ways of story in this show it is just a bunch of shorts about shenanigans and it's well worth it. A lot of hte scenes give off strong shonen-ai vibes but these are soon crushed in a spectacular fashion with near enough ingenous comedic timing. ,81,354,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For a show as short and sweet as Orenchi no Furo Jijou I figured I would give it a short sweet review.  Overall this anime isn't spectacular but it's still quite good.  The animation is very nice with the more realistic moments and the cute chibis - generally used for jokes - mixed and utilized well.  While the characters aren't particularly deep - understandable with so little time to develop them - they are likeable fully formed and funny.  It doesn't have a flowing narrative.  While new characters are introduced and reappear overtime the story itself is a series of anectodes of Tatsumi and Wakasa's life together.,82,355,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Its a cute show the animation took a second or two to get used to but personally I find it a really cute artstyle. The opening has a good song but is more serious than the actual show. They also make the most out of their time frame of four minutes with a thirty second opening the rest of the three and a half minutes is completly filled with the characters and the happenings of Tatsumi's home.,83,356,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Toshokan Sensou AKA Library Wars is a unique 12 episode political military action anime featuring some light comedy and romance. It’s definitely an anime unlike any other and the way it comes across it’s not aimed at the usual younger (and male) demographic but rather a wider audience. This might be one to watch if you don’t like anime. The fictional story has themes of censorship liberation and even war.,86,359,2019-04-13 21:35:40
In a near-future world an oppressive  media cleansing act  threatens freedom of expression and the proliferation of literature. The Library Task Force is formed to counter this threat. Libraries have become fortresses defended by well-armed and well-trained military units. The animation in this series was unusually crisp with sharp black lines highlighting character outlines. It was a great story overall and while the main theme involved the struggle between the two factions a nice bit of romance was also well-developed.,87,360,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,88,361,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There are some animes where you feel like the runtime was way too short. Library Wars is one of those and its not just for the viewer's pleasure that this anime needs more episodes. The 12 episodes were insufficient in really developing the characters and showing the awesome storyline that this anime had going for it. As a result the start of the anime was too rushed and it felt like viewers were thrown right into the heat of things without much prologue. It also diminished any opportunity to feel for the characters because viewers have yet to warm up to them.,89,362,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I give this anime a 5.5 out of 10 but I did still like it. I felt it had some common problems that short animes have mainly being lack of time to fully develop a story from start to finish. Also I don't like how bulky the characters were. I don't mean they were fat I mean their clothes were just bulky and made them look very rectangle and as if they had a bunch of layers on. However it wasn't a waste of time.,90,363,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have been waiting for this day for who knows how long. I am VERY disappointed the story did not continue after the scouts said goodbye to the SailorStars Seiya etc. The ANIMATION is weird people say its about the MANGA yeah I understand that but this is anime. Also THE STORY IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME just sped up. I am soooooooo SAD this Happened. With all the fans out there it was good enough the way it originally was. Plus their bodies and voices are WEIRDDDD unrealistic and unappealing it is plain weird. Not impressed.,97,370,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sailor Moon Crystal is horribly disappointing.,98,371,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It is a long awaited release that many dreamt to see and now we have it. The fans are divided on a few groups now: the people who watched the old anime and read the manga and loved it all the people who only watched the anime and never read the manga and the people who read the manga only. All of them are in a constant confusion as each of them waited for something that is special only to them - a straight relation to the old anime a straight relation to the manga only and so on. But what do we have? We have all together. It is a new anime adaptation of the manga that combines all of the nice things together: some of the details from the old anime such as Luna's red eyes same transformation poses; many and I really mean a lot of details from the manga; and of course new additions as it is a new creation.,100,373,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I absolutely love it. I think the animation is visually stunning especially when compared to the original aired in the USA and to other animes I've watched. I grew up watching the original TV show without reading the manga but after watching Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal I'm itching to read the manga. Love all the plot twists as well!!! ,105,378,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Although if they are going to continue on with the other 3 seasons is unknwon I found this remake enjoyable. The animation was weird at times with the noodle like arms and legs but I can look past that. Chibiusa wasn't as annoying as she was in the original series and I like how the stroy was more like the manga which gave it a different perspective not to mention it eliminated all the filler episodes. That all I can really say without giving too much of it away but during the Anime Expo 2015 nothing else was said other than they were working on the remake of the original series without editing. This dub will be more like the original japanese version just new voice actresses etc.,107,380,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Azumanga Daioh was a manga that came out just about the time I was retreating from anime and manga. I thought I'd seen it all and was tired of harem comedies or awfully derivative works about high schoolers. I pretty much vetoed any show that concerned people under the age of 18 as a rule.,120,393,2019-04-13 21:35:40

 I found myself rather addicted to this anime couldn't  wait to see what happened next. However the end was rather confusing and disappointing. After draging out the anime so much you would think the ending would be less dissappointing.   ,125,398,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Possibly the most ridiculous drama you will ever see Marmalade boy.  I'm currently rewatching it for the second time and 'why?' you may ask given my less than stellar rating review.  Honestly this series is pretty...meh.  The animation is truly old school the main character Miki is weak and sets the woman's lib movement back decades even considering this anime is almost twenty years old.  Actually Miki's a right mean little thing leading all these boys on running away in tears at EVERY opportunity.  If I met this chick I'd hate her.,126,399,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The premis of this show was hilerious. When my friends and I saw the first two episodes we could not stop laughing that I went out and bought the whole seiris the next day. That weekend Had all my girlfriends come over for a marmalade boy marathon. Bad move By the end we were so sick of the show and the movie is just a retelling of the seiries from the dudes point of view. I can no longer remember if this was really that good of a show or if we just watched it completly wrong and ruined it for ourselves but that is how i feel about it now.,127,400,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story is very bad :/ I gave it a 10 becuase the manga is so awesome and the mangaka cannot change that they sort of messed up the anime >< I <3 The story x 100000 in the Manga.,128,401,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Decode 2 is a direct continuation the first season and picks up after the events in the Tokyo Bay area that resulted in widespread death and destruction. The series opens with the capture and subsequent breakout of the terrorist group responsible for the Ryunka's theft.

I was expecting a 22 minute/episode series about slice-of-life hijinks and everyday stuff but I got 3 minute shorts and squandered potential. It would have been better as a 22 minute 13 episode series with more depth and plot. At first it left me disappointed but after I got over it I went back and enjoyed it for what it was: a brief short series on the comedic misunderstandings of the two mains. As the episodic events revolve around their heights it's natural that the jokes would revolve around that in turn. It's decent enough for a giggle or even a laugh here or there; there's just enough continuity that it almost feels a bit like there's some progression going on and while it may get repetitive it has it's charm. It's nothing brilliant but it's decent enough to warrant 40 minutes of your time.,143,415,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a nice comedy and slice of life series. Most of itas comedy and there really wasn’t a story arc until the last 2 or 3 episodes. really like how they managed the last episode. It was a nice introduction ofome of the characters even though you knew who they were already and it wasspecially nice seeing what Torako’s life was like before going into highchool after what was shown in the prior episode.,145,417,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show had a really confusing storyline. I still do not know what Throne of Yord's ambisions were. There was only a little character development. There was not a lot of relationship displayed between people. There was more of a telling of the relations. I think this show was very confusing and could have been made better. It wasn't a horrible show but I didn't really like it. It was also a little boring.,147,419,2019-04-13 21:35:40

After having enjoyed the anime Bokurano the other works of mangaka Morihiro Kitoh piqued my interest. This is a review of the Narutaru anime coming from someone who has not read the manga. I would suggest reading the manga because sources indicate it's a much more complete product. I had hoped that the negative feedback surrounding this series was simply misplaced. Unfortunately for me I've come away from Narutaru disappointed.,158,430,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I first heard about this film while review videos to cure boredom.  Then one video was about Redline.  However that just made me aware of the movie's existence.  Later I received many recommendations for anime movies and Redline was one of the more numerous recommendations.  So I just started watching it to finally see what it was all about,171,443,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The Story was captivating and the animation fresh. The slight hint of romance really gave it that lovely touch. The comedic exaggeration of various nitrous used gave the race scenes a  WOW  factor. The music perfectly matched all the scenes. The Characters likable and interesting with their respected backrounds. Overall this is a must watch to anybody though I do suggest that the audience is over 18 as there is some nudity and violence as well as violence but SUGOI!,178,449,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Not great but not the worst. It's an animated Fast and Furious. And that series is terrible except the first film. So this movie pretty much missed the mark for me on all points. If you find nothing interesting about cars this will bore the crap out of you. I watched this to see if it was  kid friendly . It has ONE nudity scene that I can remember and average swearing. So it's safe for all ages. Though I doubt  our son will be entertained much.,185,456,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Chokotto Sister is one of those animes that you will like immediately and enjoy or you'll absolutely hate it. The quirky characters wanting to live simple lives are what drive this anime. Some of the comedy comes from Choko's guide book to being a good little sister which often is not age appropriate for her. Urban legend has it that this was slated to be 26 episodes but cut to 24 due to the law. Many of the characters are endearing in their quirks. The main problem people may have with it is like Aria the animation there are no major bad guys and not any real fighting. The conflicts are mostly limited to how the characters want to be vs. how things are going for them. ,195,466,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For Bleach fans this OVA definitely made up for the episodes in the anime. The anime completely ruined the whole Grand Fischer vs. Ichigo thing. The OVA is basically like Bleach without the filler.

Fairy Tail is by far the best anime I have ever seen.I just love it.The characters are all unique and lovely.The whole story and the plot are very intresting.,203,474,2019-04-13 21:35:40
We are going to start this (Fairy)Tail  of epic moments  through  the period I took to exam in every aspect  the anime title  “Fairy Tail”. I’ll start by saying than I’m a dedicated fan of anime starting from 2010 (already 4 years) not so much time like other people who have already spend almost a decade doing their favorite hobby – watching anime. At the start of 2014- January to be exact I decided to “travel” through the Fairyland of “ Fairy Tail”. Before I did this I spend some time reading reviews-posts-opinions on the  web and the thing that surprised me the most was the “hate”  on this series with  reasons  like “copy of the Big ones” –“ Trashy series who are trying to promote friendship” – “simple story with too much fan service” based on these facts I took the opportunity to exam-watch  “Fairy Tail” closely  which I knew from past years but I didn’t choose to watch it for my personal reasons. For start I want to say that I’m writing this review  not to persuaded you  to definitely watch this series but to give you in fact the right reasons & the blind spots-worst parts by my side so that you will have the opportunity to decide alone if you must watch or not the specific anime title “Fairy Tail”.,204,475,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a good anime because of an okay story line. I love the characters of this anime because they are really awesome people and they can use magic and that is so cool. I love the music and some of the voices of the characters so much. The animation of this anime is so good. ,205,476,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What is there to say Fairy Tail is an awsome anime. The story is done well the animation is good the soundtracks are god-like. Its fun funny action packed Very minor fan service from time to time with just a dash of feels thrown in every now and again just to keep you on your toes. It is and always shall be in my top 10 favorites.,206,477,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Hiro Mashima is a great artist and has created another great anime that is one of the top most read mangas on OneManga.com. Which makes it the most popular anime/maga known today. The characters are perfect and the story revolves around the events that happen. Which also makes the story ever so interesting and even though some peope think that the charaters are like Hiro's Manga Rave Master characters they are not similar one bit. The one thing that makes them the same is the way they react to things and the story is not similar to One Piece either. So FU Fairy Tale haters. The animation is ok the threeD efect is kind of annoying but it adds to the suspense of the fighting sequences. Over all the anime is one of the top animes that I would reconcider to watch if you are a fan of Hiro Mashima's work. ",207,478,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh Fairy Tail... where does one begin. Wellllll let's see. I can start with that the fact of the characters just make the anime. I mean the amount of apparent romance in the begin was pretty abismal... but as it progressed you could just see the pairs forming in your head. The story is pretty good too. So far there's nothing too confusing in it. It's one of those animes that you never want to end. And when it does you dont want there to be a spin off cause you love the orginial characters tooo much.,209,480,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,210,481,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story was  very good and had a lot of impact to the viewers. I would rather prefer to add more action and fight scenes when Fairy Tail continues again. The sounds were impressive and matched almost all of the scenes in Fairy Tail. I would like them to be more detailed about the characters because their animation is not as good as some of the animes I've watched. I hope you continue Fairy Tail sooner and keep up the good work.,211,482,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the best anime that I've ever watched. Usually I stay away from this type of anime because I think that they're too boyish I even try to watch this out of boredom but as Erza come out I can't stop watching it and as they show me how they love their guild I felt like I was a part of it too. I laugh with them I cried with them  there were even times that I want to enter the screen just to lend them a hand. I might sound crazy that I seems to be so attatched to this but this is what I really feel. Fairy tail is the Best!,212,483,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I LOVE this anime! I think everyone should watch it! If you are into adventures and dragons this anime is for you. The reason why I enjoyed it was because it caught my attention right in the beginning. One of my friends also suggested that I watch it as well.,213,484,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Could be the best of the longer series out there. ,214,485,2019-04-13 21:35:40
fairy tale is amazing it is like a world without limits the story is in what i would call a world of dreams where magic types are so vast i cant even describe them. the story line is great the set up is awesome and i am really enjoying it so far.,215,486,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fairy Tail is amazing I've searched for a show that would satisfy my anime craving as much as the best ones i've seen DBZNarutoBleachFull Metal Alchemistand Inyuyasha.Finally I found one that has the same power to make you fall in love with the characters and the story behind it.The action is kick ass and the storyline can make you wanna cheer for the bad guys to get their butts kicked.The story can make you get excitedlaugheven jerk some tearsand most of all make you want to see more!If you are looking for a new anime great to watch this is definitely a great choice of anime to watch.Watch it and enjoy!-Hellzblade,216,487,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fairy Tail is an incredibly well-done feel-good show and while it may not make you think and ponder the secrets of the universe it's definitely entertaining and even heartwarming at times. If I could describe the show in one line it would be  Yu-Gi-Oh! done right  because it's constantly pushing friendship and somehow succeeds. On top of that the show has the rare ability of effortlessly flowing between its humorous and emotional moments. The characters are all very likeable the soundtrack is full of masterpieces the voice actors are great and the show's jam-packed full of creativity,217,488,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I think this is a very nice anime to watch. There's lost of cool action to keep you entertained but there is the comical side to it too. Story is well thought out and i don't feel as though the arcs are stretched out to make the show long like other shows do. The characters a very nicely made and each has their own unique aspect for you to love or maybe even hate. I would highly recommend watching this if you like action but with a comical side. :),218,489,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'll start off by telling you about how I decided to watch this anime. Many of my friends enjoyed it and while I never actually intended on watching this I was in that period of time when I recently finished an anime I really enjoyed and didn't want it to end but it did. So I went against every time I told myself I wasn't going to watch it and I did. Surprisingly I actually liked it.,219,490,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story develops around the Fairy Tail wizards  they get different quests  continuously get into trouble  and I won't lie  it is pretty fine  that goes for the first few missions they get .In the latest episodes it's like the creator ran out of ideas and started picking up stuff from 10- years old kids cartoons. I liked when Gray had to fight Lyon  the battle against Laxus  but everything else got too annoying  too repetitive  they try to make the anime funny but they fail hard at it  I would've really liked this to be a serious anime  with lots of fight  blood etc. just like bleach  it would've been a great success.The animation is fine  I can't say anything bad about it  the spells are pretty well shaped  they have summons and all kind of cool stuff . I can't say that about characters they are too childish  most of them look like Guys from Looney Tunes . Sounds are good   the voices are good and really suit the type of person the character is . I especially like Natsu's and Erza's voice .,220,491,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Excellent. Deserves more recognition,227,497,2019-04-13 21:35:40
All i can say about this anime is that it's a miracle worker! I absolutely LOVE this anime it's the only anime i could can and have gotten ALL of my siblings hooked on it took me 4 years but i finally found its! Yes it is the only anime we can all watch but we have watched every single episode on Netflix about 40000 times! so baby steps! This is the most emotional anime ever you will cry laugh scream and throw something across the room all while dying a little inside and then want to watch it all over again! It shows you how far friendship and family can go and how far you yourself can take it if you just believe! There are so many lessons to learn from this anime and i love every last one of them. ,228,498,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At first I thought  it'll get better  and then i though  well maybe a few more episodes that one bad guy looked cool  and then I realized I was wasting my time and I got gayed. It's ok for children and I guess thats ok for them to watch it and like it... all I know is that I was a lot cooler kid than them growing up.,230,500,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love this anime. The storyline is let's just say interesting. The fights take up so much less time than most other mainstream anime. The animation is really good since it's pretty new and still coming out. It's better than most of the long ones since those are usually the old ones. The music OMG I love it! Some scenes (because of the music) made me want to cry and some were just so funny... The characters are really funny too. I love Erza Gray Wendy Mira Gajeel Juvia Jellal Virgo and almost everyone in there! This anime is a must watch. Go Fairy Tail!,235,505,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Uno de los mejores shounen que hay la banda sonora es alucinante al punto de descargarla para escucharla por mi cuenta. Los personajes son muy buenos y les tomas cariño rapidamente. Las peleas son muy buenas y con un toque de epicidad muy interesante. ,236,506,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hey I recommend this anime for people who not only like magical animes but wih good friendship and of course humor. I was a bit upset to find that lucy and natsu did not get together at all throughout the anime but that gets made up by all the good adventures they all have even if they are insane and physically impossible but ats anime for ya ^-^.,237,507,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime starts out pretty good I liked it up until this recent season,238,508,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fairy tail...is one of the few best animes that is out there right nowit has a great storyit sucks you into the showits very interesting and very humurous as wellthe characters are greateach one of them have their own particular background story so its really interesting to see where they where beforethe battle scenes in fairy tail are really amazingit really gets you hyped and have you thinking ''What'll happen next?'' all in all fairy tail is an amazing anime and i encourage those who haven't seen itto go watch it.,239,509,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Fairy tail sucksand that's a fact.Everything about it sucks(except the music)the fansthe story(which it clearly doesn't have)the animation...Anywayi used to be a fairy tail fan until they released Fairy tail 2014.The animation is rubbishseriously.My favorite character got ruined(thank you very much)and my favorite character was Kagura.They ruined her soooo muchshe used to be badass and cool and now she is ugly and useless.They ruined her with the new animationthey made her look like a weakling even though she is stronger than Erza.,242,512,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is by far my favorite anime. I loved the characters the plot and the constant supply of entertainment and action. I really enjoyed the way the whole anime panned out and it never dragged on an arc for too long however it was a litte boring for a while after the S-Class exams. ,243,513,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fairy Tail is an awesome anime is has a great story line and its characters are very loveable in every eposde something is always happening it is also very emotional tears will be shed and your faces will fall off from all the laughter! THEY WILL FALL OFF!,244,514,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let’s start this review by saying that I’m a fan of this show. However I’m not a fanboy who will look for excuses for every (huge or little) bad point. If you want a huge rant about why FT is bad go look at roriconfan’s review. If you only want to hear “omg this is tha best show eva omg omg must watch blabla” then you should go somewhere else as well. I’ll go for the way in between those two: I really like the show but I also see the good and bad points in it. Well whatever let’s get started.,245,515,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,246,516,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was searcing for a new episode of an anime and I saw Fairy tail. I said that I should see whats it about. I was really amazed how how great the story was. I watched the Infinity clock arc and I tought it was really an arc but a friend told me that it was a filler and I was like ' You're lying it can't be a filler.' The animation is simply great. And the characters...I like mostly of them but the one who annoy me the most are Lissana and Flare. The sound is pretty good once I heared the openings and endings they got stuck in my head. Overall it's great I love the fact that they care a lot about their nakamas like I care about my friends a lot.,247,517,2019-04-13 21:35:40
In my opinion Fairy Tail is an amazing anime. I recommend this for people who like magic comedy who are okay with being emotional (I cried a few times) and people who like a big series! It is a great anime. It does have curse words with. So you have to BE AWARE. But I love this anime so much!,248,518,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Its...alright. You know. ",249,519,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Personally I love Fairy Tail. I think the characters are fantastic along with the animation and the sound. To me the story isn't hard to follow and it's quite well told with lots of suspense and action. But for me personally the story can seem dull at times or uninteresting and sometimes I'm just bored of what sometimes feels like the same things happening over and over again. Throughout this Review I have been talking about the bad things in the anime Fairytail so now I will talk about all the good things that make up this anime.,250,520,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Easily one of my favorite shows of all time i love it so much and will reccomend it to everyone. it has fun and serious storylines it has very colourful and deep characters it has the amazing HAPPY everyones favorite flying cat ;) it is a all round good show.,251,521,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Way to take a brilliant concept and flush it down the toilet. At first I thought I'd give it a try because it seemed interesting enough but boy was it bad. The story is too muddled out and gives little to no payoff. It has that same problem that Soul Eater has in which it is too manic. From a critical standpoint this is just a watered down version of One Piece. Natsu is a lamer version of Luffy Lucy is a ditzier version of Nami Happy is an annoying version of Chopper (etc.) The jokes include characters screaming at each other Natsu being motion sick. Their comic relief takes way too long to end before something important happens that it becomes irrelevant.,258,528,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hiro Mashima once created a series called Rave Master. It was a pretty good series. It was fun charming and had some memorable characters. ,259,529,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For the first ten episodes it is really slow since it is just building up the story line. However after that it is really jam packed with adventure and a really great plot line. ,263,533,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While I fully realize my review seems ridiculously good and I admit I am by no means an experienced anime connoisseur I have seen many other anime and would like to bring attention to Fairy Tail for a unique reason: it is an anime for teenagers and young adults that is not gory or bloody. All of the other current most popular anime for this age group feature somber casting a desperate struggle for survival and of course plenty of blood violence and other dark themes and images. To me Fairy Tail is the unique anime with fun and exciting adventures that are not overly childish an interesting cast of characters and an overall uplifting attitude not to mention its precious moments of comedy that never cease to make me laugh. It is within that beautiful sweet spot between childish and mature moving past the corny expressions and themes of anime designed for children like Pokemon yet not so dark and depressing or down-right gory as Attack on Titan Full-Metal Alchemist or Fate Zero. I for one want to enjoy watching anime not be depressed by adult content or bored with childish themes. Fairy Tail is the perfect oasis for like-minded thinkers and I encourage every to at least give it a try.,264,534,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Fairy Tail is the anime adaption of Hiro Mashima's manga of the same name and since it's debut in 2009 it has enjoyed insane amounts of success being regarded as a possible candidate for  The Big Three  (many argue it has usurped the spot that was held by  Bleach ) and recieving high critical acclaim from fans and reviewers alike.,265,535,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Season 2 was definitely much better in the drama elementhen the former. Especially the graduation ceremony in the first half of it. I’mlso very happy that Sei was still in the big picture she’s probably myavorite of the 1st set of Roses. Really not much else to say sinceost of it is the same characters with only two new ones. The last episode wasretty disappointing I was hoping for at least another episode but I supposet’ll suffice since I still have the OVA and the 3rd series toatch.,268,538,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ayakashi is a load of garbage that will make you want to delete your memories so you won't be embarassed with how you wasted your time and instead be left with the intriguing proposition that you drank until you blacked out. Don't watch it. Really just don't. I can't stress it enough. I made the mistake because the first few episodes are promising and then went through the rest in the hopes that there might be one moment where it stops making me want to cause internal bleeding in my brain. There wasn't one.,278,548,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Funny funny funny. It was perverted humor sarcastic humor and every other kind of humor you can think of thrown together. There are fight scenes unrequited love scenes straight up comedy and plenty of bada** characters. Almost all the supporting characters are martial arts masters with a gardening chick thrown in for romantic dramatic interest. They are intense terrifying and completely awesome. The characters are the main draw of this anime. Everything else is good but even if it had less plot their everyday interactions still make a hilarious anime. It does get serious when Kenichi (the main character) is in his fights with the multitude of bad guys that come out of the woodwork but other than that be prepared to laugh because even his training by the masters causes you to get a good chuckle. watch this when looking for comedy with some action mixed in.,280,550,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Honestly were should I start? My brother first introduced me to this Manga and I intantly became engrossed with it. I love the Manga but the Anime itself is a little disappointing because it lack its sense of humour but otherwise the comedy rates average.,285,555,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After watching D-Grayman and being rather dissappointed and bored with it I picked up Kenichi.  To my pleasant suprise this anime was pretty good.  To put it simply it was the anime that you hoped Tenjou Tenge was.  Now Tenjou Tenge was more brutal and I really liked that aspect but it terms of the general direction of the anime Kenichi was perfect.,286,556,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love keninchi its a great story just a normal nice kid who is picked on and kind of a loner. He learns to stand up for himself and his friends by learning martial arts and becomes the pupil of 5 great martial arts teachers. This anime just gives you spirit makes you belive you can i highly suggest it,287,557,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I dropped this anime because of the main character...he always get's beaten and then his senseis teach him 2 or 3 attacks or deffences and he wins. So my point is that the story is almost always the same and you will actually loose your time watching this anime...,288,558,2019-04-13 21:35:40
HSDK has the dubious distinction of being my #1 anime of all time. It's the only anime series I've watched more than 10 times now and continue to do so as time goes on. It never fails to bring a smile to my eyes yes eyes a task infinitely harder to do than just making me smile with my mouth alone. It's an anime who's sum does not equal it's parts since the only thing I rated at a perfect ten here was it's characters.,289,559,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really did enjoy a lot this anime. The story was very well put togheter. At the end it does give you a kind of feeling that the story could keep on going.But it could end there which it did in the anime. I liked how the characters life connected with the other characters. The animation made the anime very funny and fun to watch. I really enjoyed watching how the battels carried out.The sound effects mached quite nice with what was going on. I absolutely loved the music they played specially the one that they played in the last battel. The characters where all very funny and had there soft spot. Some characters sadlly you did not find out a lot about. Over all I really do love this anime it was very funny and hear warming.,291,561,2019-04-13 21:35:40
STORY:,292,562,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've never seen a series in which the main character starts at level  0  and works his way up to the top. Most anime characters from series like Naruto Bleach Yu Yu Hakusho Samurai Champloo could already fight. Kenichi is a wimpy shrimp lol! He's always being bullied at school everyday until he comes across a secret dojo. He learns different techniques from different masters and ends up becoming a destructive fighting force. This series has so many elements that makes it great. 1)The comedy is on point each and every time. I must say it's a lot funnier than most series I've seen. Kenichi has a high strung personality. If you think Naruto is hyperactive then Kenichi is going to be out of this world lol. Even the masters pick and tease Kenichi as well. 2)The story develops very well throughout the series. He meets new rivals and also gains friends along the way (that have his back). 3)The action is on point as well. Of course his masters are on a different fighting level altogether. Anyway I've seen all 50 episodes! This is must see for all anime lovers. It has something for everyone in it! (P.S. Check out my list for the best of Anime-Action),293,563,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Watching this is ultimately a waste of time. There is nearly no new footage excluding previews for the seventh film. Mostly it is just a bunch of flashbacks with music dominating everything. It ends up as an incoherent mess that manages to recap only if you've already seen everything up to that point in the series otherwise it adds nothing.,298,568,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is by far Takena's worst stop motion. There is seriously no point in watching this unless you want more watched anime or something. If so then Takena's vids are the easiest way to go. But you won't enjoy this video nor will you gain anything from watching it.,300,570,2019-04-13 21:35:40
wtf did i just watch? well it's a stop motion  movie  where a ball of clay pushes a newspaper ball which hits another ball of clay. they end up fighting (or is that supposed to be sex at the end? honestly couldn't tell),301,571,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai is a light novel that was written in 2009 and is still ongoing as you probably know they have adapted this into an anime the light novel was written by Reiji Kaitō and I have just started to sink my teeth into the manga after watching the anime.,304,574,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Allright. It's been a while since I've done something like this so bear with me as I try to find my way again.I did quite a lot of them in the past on a different website which you can find here: http://legendsofsatura.net/index.php/forum125/6-reviewing-guild.html,305,575,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Probably the best anime for me of this season. In the end of all episodes it stops on the best part keeping you interested. I like the animation its pretty good the story is not so unique its about dolls controlled powered by magic and used by puppeters. Its really nicely created world. The sounds are really good the characters are balanced good and they have the thing you would be wanting for the lovers of Ecchi (like me ^^ ). I cant think of an anime that can be said its simillar to this... But I would say WATCH IT :),307,577,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hetalia isn't for everyone but I absolutely love this show. It's really unique with it's large cast of characters and comedy. Each episodes only five minutes long so there isn't much plot in some episodes but it's a great anime. Watch it with an open mind because there are a lot of stereotypes about countries.,322,592,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay so first off i love the story. Its extreamly cute hate the fact there is only one episode and that it is only 23 minutes long i just hate that. It was a cute story and i think they should of done more episodes honestly i thought it should of been a series It would of been a good one but sadly its only one episode thats why i give it a 9.5 i love every thing else but that.,329,599,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I honestly don't see why people hate this so much >_> I actually found it quite hilarious. Yeah theres not much char development or explanation but its a 30 min OVA what do you expect? Just the very though that this exists during the 80's is hilarious in itself. It might have been something really terrible if it was done during our time but I think the 80's atmosphere (animation and music) adds a nice touch to this kind of story. Plus I believe this is the first anime ever to feature tentacles but no sex lol. Also the female gang member(Maki) was probably the most useful character in the anime which goes against the general streotypes that females are useless in most earlier anime. Overall I thought it was a nice little piece of animation that people seem to hate for no reason. ,333,603,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Call Me Tonight is a 30 minute OVA the first of 4 from Pink Noise. This was a fanservice OVA so expect lots of fanservice. The story is slim. A girl named Rumi who is  part owner of a phone sex club comes into contact with a boy named Ryou. Ryou has a certain problem whenever he thinks about perverted things or is aroused he turns into a monster. Rumi likes Ryou and helps him overcome his problem. Other people get involved that make things harder. The animation is really good for it's time. It's very good quality. Very nice to look at. Remember this was 1986. The sound was very typical of 80's anime. The characters have little developement because of the short length of the OVA. This is considered a rare anime. Lots of fanservice. It has horror sci-fi comedic and heartwarming elements. It won't be for everyone. It's short. Check it out.,334,604,2019-04-13 21:35:40

angel beats was a good series to watch it had some key features that made it a good series like GirlDeMo and the constant comical abuse of characters.  The worst part of the series was the overall plot.  the being trapped in the afterlife trying to find your way out was nice but the series started to turn bad once kanade joined the sss.  That eliminated the original plot of figting against her.  They could have easily played that out longer than they did.  What killed it even more was the fast that the new bad guy the acting president in place of kanade ALSO joined the sss.,350,620,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,351,621,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This one is a bit confusing to get into at least initially.  From the start you and apparently the main character are lost in this new unreasonable setting that seems far more in line with some weird dream or even a nightmare than any sort of reality.  The very idea of who are good guys and bad guys and motivations for each are also almost as foggy.  Gradually this becomes a bit clearer but still feels murky at times.  It ends on a good note with a rather positive spin despite all the convuloted misdirective and muddled attempts to side track you and the lead character.  The story in general is a mix between tragedy drama spiritual morality tales and a side of music and video game elements thrown in.  After it is all over you might start to wonder about perspectives when considering who viewpoint is correct or incorrect.  If nothing else it might inspire viewers to understand things from other people's perspectives more rather than jumping to immediate and negative conclusions.  At the same time as all that there are aspects of extreme isolation and a lingering sense of control.  In other senses somethings feel a bit incomplete as only the main characters seem to have an ending story.  Still it is a interesting and pleasant show to watch if you are willing to stay with the show long enough for all the fuzzy sensations to clarify and start to make sense.,352,622,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Episodes are running smoothly from the start really like the fight scenes and all. But I just don't like the ending it's quite frustrating and pointless for me. ,353,623,2019-04-13 21:35:40
WoW.. to anyone who stopped watching after the first few episodes I'm sorry you missed out big time. I was a bit turned off by the first three episodes myself seemed like the anime was going to be just another cut and paste school/silly anime but it wasn't that long after the end of the third episode that the show took a turn for the serious and really started getting me hooked. By the last episode I was so into the show that I actually watched all thirteen episodes without even stopping to go to the bathroom. It really made you care about the characters and the story was really engaging and even surprising. At times things in the show would take a sudden turn from funny and relaxed to dark and unnerving then thrust into a damn near heroic heart warming scene.,354,624,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ok the story was good because it kind of makes you think about life a little and has a good General story a little funny too but I'm not saying it's great because it was sad and left me hanging at the end so I say it was good not ok or good.,355,625,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of the most beautiful and engaging anime's i have watched in a very long time the fact it relates to most modern day things occuring makes it feel more real and allows you to be become immersed in the story. As well as that it is a very emotional and moving series i don't often cry but i found myself sobbing in the final moments of this prestigious and well known anime. If your looking for a decent romantic/supernatural and at some points comedic story and willing to shed a few tears in the process then this is a great anime for you!,364,634,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story: Angel Beats had an amazing story. It had the climax where they needed to be and you never got jumbled up with the flash backs or anything. It was on point the whole time it kept you wanting more. Which is what everyone wants. There was a bit of everything action comedy and romance. This literally had it all was a great story line.,365,635,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is great for those who love shows that aren't the norm and who enjoy a few interesting twists. The first episode turned me off to it but if you give it a chance and watch beyond that it's a pretty touching show. Somewhat ideologically sensitive since the entire plot takes place in the afterlife. My main issue with it is what seems to be becoming common practice anymore... they rush toward the end so it feels as if important developments were left out and some things are rather vaguely explained.,375,645,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Angel Beats is... unique. At least I think so. The plot follows a group of dead teenagers running around in the afterlife(or more accurately highschool purgatory). Their goal is to free themselves from the tyrannical Angel a robot like girl who rules with an iron fist. It's known for it's insane feelz and drama though to be honest that's not really the show's strength.,378,648,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kinda sucks,382,652,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel beats is best described as say a layered cake u start of with the violence and light heartedness but as you work your way down u find this anime to be surprising deep for only 13 episodes this is the only place where i believe they fell short of the mark they tried to cram so much into 13 episodes it just became a jumble in places i believe they could have easily made this into 25 or so episodes making time to go in depth with more of the charters. the sound quality was great as was the character voices the thing that made the music in this anime stand out was the band in it called girl dead monster its songs where made for this anime and since have become famous across Asia. the animation in this anime was well above average i believe the colours where bright and clear cut which really helped in the music scenes where most animation would have fell short. the story is original and very watch able but to fast paced some important scenes where skipped over in seconds which is this amines worse problem. the characters where great with a variety of personality's and styles but most characters where looked over with only a few going into detail. I would deferentially recommend watching this anime as it is my #1 anime and will be for some time :),383,653,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel Beats is an original anime placing the main characters in a Purgatory like world to try to get them to figure out their life and achieve their life ambition before they move on to the afterlife. It manages to balance it's comedy and tragedy elements suprisingly well without feeling schizophrenic at any point but manages to hit both on the head.,384,654,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,385,655,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel Beats was an anime which I could watch if I wanted to over 5 times and still want to watch it over again. The characters are really rememberable and at some points throught the anime I find myself awefully depreased after a character dies (again) or after learning about something aweful. I highly recommend this to those who have a strong will (and ALOT of Time on their hands),386,656,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Does Angel Beats need another review? After browsing through sixteen pages of reviews I'd say no. But hey I review everything I see and this Anime was just too good to be left out. So without further ado let's do this!,387,657,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I watched it because somewhere I found it in the category 'Anime similar to Clannad' but I found it nowhere near to Clannad. Since I started the series I have to complete it too. I thought to drop it at 4th -5th episode as ut was boring but I continued as I don't like to drop in between. It started getting interesting after 6 episodes when Otonashi regained his memories. After that I must say all episodes make sense then. The last episode was just superb. It left me in tears.  ,390,660,2019-04-13 21:35:40
(My opinion everyone) ,391,661,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story focuses on a teen a named Otonashi with no memories of hi past has been dropped in the middle of a school yard that happens to be pergatory! He is confronted by the leader of the SSS an group of fellow dead teens whose objective is to defeat a seemingly innocent little girl named Angel in order to see the big man him self. Otonashi has to deal with the amnesia and the stress of disappearing.,392,662,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. Have a fear of death or feeling rather depressed this show will only make that worse. It has it's happy endings but you may as well break out the tissues because you'll be balling at the end of most episodes. They add in a good dose of action and comedy to keep your spirits up but they amount to little more than destractions in the long run. Seriously recomend you watch it.,397,667,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story and the plot was great! Unfortunately they should have just kept going. It felt like it was slightly rushed and even though it got all the important plot lines and such they should have kept going or the anime could have stretched more to give more further details on each character.,400,670,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This will be short. I personally thought the ending was a little bit rushed. Maybe if this was a 24 episode series it would work out better. There needed to be a little bit more character development between Tachibana and Otonashi. ,402,672,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While I sat down and watched Angel Beats! I thought to myself this is probably another knock off of Haruhi or maybe another anime that I have watched but I was DEAD WRONG!

This is my first review on Anime Planet but not my first review. I used to use MyAnimeList until it started to f**k up on me and wouldn't work. It does that a lot it's fixed-ish now but knowing that site it will probably happen again. It's not actually my PC it is literally the site. Now I absolutely loved this anime the storyline was great animation yeah stuff like dat screw dis shit lets go to weview.,404,674,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright so I just finished watching this anime and I decided it was well worth the effort to write my opinion of it for others who might be interested in it.  At first I really didn't know what to think I honestly only started watching this because it was on someones top ten best anime lists and it happened to be on netflix.  So I said what the hell and gave it a try even though from the cover it didn't really seem like anything special.  Well I started watching it and it only took me 3 days to finish the series(for me that's not much time).  I immediately loved the music animation and the basis of the story.,405,675,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is at rank 55 at the time I write this... that is just heartbreaking to see it so high.  Angel beats is what you get when you take a good (though not exactly original) idea and (for lack of a better word) bullshit it the whole way through. Now quick question what is the most important thing in any show or book or movie? If you answered anything but characters and/or story then we have a problem. While Angel Beats was not an absolute failure at these aspects it was very ineffective at building them correctly. ,412,680,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think I didnt have any food after cereal and leftover pizza for breakfast. Well I had 12 packs of Doritos but that's not the point the point is youll be tempted to watch this in one sitting (which I did). You shouldn't do that actually.,423,690,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There is so much to this series that my brain can't quite wrap itself around and usually that's a bad thing for an anime. But this is different. By the end of the anime I was left with so many positive juicy warm and fuzzy emotions that I can't even begin to list them all. I think part of it was my compassion for the main characters and their respective pasts and an equal part of it was the way those characters overcame their problems by the end of the series. By the end of the series I was nearly in tears and I'm not going to try to explain why because I simply can't with words alone.,424,691,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story - The whole plot was pretty good and the theme seemed pretty original. I emmediatly fell in love with the whole idea that nobdoy could die and how they were able to make if funny. It was funny when it needed to be and serious when it needed to be. My favorite episode was episode 2 when they were trying to get to the underground workshop. As the story moved along and when I realized that the characters could move on if they fulfill their wishes I got scared that one of them would dissapear especially with Hinata during the baseball game. I loved the whole story. It was a great anime to watch.,434,701,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love and hate this anime all at the same time. The story is great all the characters are likable the music/Sound track to this anime is right up there with my top favorites. The thing I hate about it is how many times this anime made me feel and feel hard. It makes it hard to watch over again. Overall its a great anime and well worth the watch. BE READY TO FEEL.,435,702,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel Beats Review:,437,703,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel beats is in a word bipolar. It will have you laughing your pants of one scene and crying your heart out the next. Honestly i don't want to say too much cause this one really is about the journey. Admittedly there are more than a few glaring potholes but just go with it. If you haven't seen this you should watch it what more is there to say.,438,704,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,439,705,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime It's the best one I watched and I totally reccomend it! I thought the animation and story was great! Even though in some parts of the anime was horrifying I also thought it actually kind of cool at the same time. I think this anime is a must watch!,440,706,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story- I have to give the creators of Angel Beats credit: they are brave (stupid?) to take on a subject with so much depth.  Angel Beats follows the story of young Otonashi Yuzuru.  After he dies he wakes up in high school his memories lost in the middle of a battle.   On one side there is Nakamura Yuri a brash high school girl with the requisite purple hair interesting bow and short uniform skirt.  She is the leader of a band of gun-toting high school students known as the Battle Front fighting against the unfairness of their past lives.  And on the other side is a girl known only as Angel the quiet silver haired student body president who shows as much emotion as a porcelain doll.   Now add to the story if you please one rocking girl band with not one but two lead singers a small dark haired evil boy with a god complex a ninja girl obsessed with wind-up puppies a loud purple haired idiot wielding an axe a dancing hippie who only quotes songs and a long list of other ensemble members who fall happily with in the Anime character lexicon.  Suffice it to say: it is too much.   Between the meta-physical subject matter (reincarnation enlightenment the fight against God) and the large cast of characters I was both confused and sometimes bored by the episodes.  What exactly are they fighting against again?   How does that kick-ass concert in the gym further the cause?  You made your guns out of mud?  Sigh. On the positive it was interesting following each individual character’s story learning how they came to this purgatorial high school and following them as they achieved there what they could not achieve in life.   And again the subject matter is great fodder for stories but perhaps not this story told in so few episodes.,441,707,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Angels Beats is a perfect combination of comedy actions and drama. This anime can have you laughing and then holding back tears in the same episode. I really liked the idea of people who werent able to live a full life on earth coming to a purgitory type world where they can live their lives how they please and finally come to terms with their fate. The writers provide the backstories of the vharacters well and it really adds to the viewer satisfaction when you see the characters move on and accept their deaths. I believe how the characters live is  a testimony on how we should all live our lives and that is to accept that bad things will happen to us but being hung up on the past will not do anything but continue to burden us with that bagage and only cause further sadness. All in all I think this is a great anime for all sorts of anime fans the character developement storyline and animation are all pretty spot on oh and by the way make sure you grab a box of tissues for the final episode.,444,710,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one AMAZING anime and it is #2 on my list of favorites! ( Second only to Clannad and After Story),445,711,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,446,712,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this is a comment not a review) this anime all epsidoes i did not cry  i shed a tear when otanashi dies in his previous life in all other anime ive cried a tiny bit if it was sad. but the ending of angel beats made me cry like a baby i did not know a anime can make me cry this much ut it did. it would of been nice for a add on to see what happens next but overall the ending is sad and good at the same time. the music i felt and heard was beautifal and i liked the charcters so angel beats i recommend it ,447,713,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After a long time of overlooking it I finally watched Angel Beats. And Im glad I did. This is not one of the best but certainly one of the most memorable series in existence. I do feel a bit disappointed because with a bit more work and editing this would be a true masterpiece this way though its just good.,448,714,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"At first i wasnt so sure but this turned out to be one of my all time favorites! the characters were well developed and hilarious. the plot was interesting and different and was also deeper than i thought it was going to turn out to be.i was laughing then crying (not ashamed to say that haha) throughout the whole thing. Each character had his or her own way of adding a great addition to their group of  morons  and i couldnt help but love every single one of them..im usually very picky and analytical of anime but this one drew me in and i just couldnt stop watching! i gave in a 9 out of ten just because i thouht the last episode was a little slow even though i teared up a little.

I really love this story i love the way they keep you busy with the first episode and near the end they reveal all the sadness. I never let out a tear for an anime or other tv shows but this anime was currently the closest together with clannad. The music they use is just amazing the characters aren't that special. ,452,718,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Beautiful very emotional I would expected nothing less with music from the great Jun Maeda (Clannad). When this ending hits you WILL be crying the gravity of the sadness and combined happiness is so great that you will still be crying months later as you think back on this wonderful show just like I am doing now as I write this.,454,719,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just spent all daywatching this series and I am glad I am.  The story is excellent and then ending in it's self is perfect.  The last episode made me cry and only a few anime have gone there however when you see the last of the episode you have no choice but to smile.,455,720,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved this anime so much! It had a big invluence on my life. After watching I went and signed up as an organ donor I reccomend it to any anime lover it will truely be worth every second!,456,721,2019-04-13 21:35:40
-Story-,457,722,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a fun little anime of discovorys. the charactors were flawed and vibrent and made me laugh quite a bit. for me the story started as one kind of story and evolved in to another a more emotion driven build up to the end as the real purpase for thsi world was revealed. This is one of the better bits of story telling I ahve come across pulling you in with the charactors makeing you laugh and slowly realizing what each of them was holding back and what was holding them there. it helped that the story was quite willing to poke fun at itself and other cliches from other anime to keep you going now and then. ,458,723,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel Beats! is one of those anime that you'll come out from feeling like a different person The animation story and characters are all brilliantly created. Just a heads up though if you're depressed or just lost a loved one DO NOT WATCH ANGEL BEATS! The amount of Feels in this anime is crazy. I cried 6 times during the course of this anime with the last time lasting an hour but enough about that. Angel Beats! is a story about a place after death and before Heavan. People that end up their have something linking them to there lifes and until they let go of that they are unable to pass however this is unknown to the students who attend this place. That concept alone makes Angel Beats! Brilliant. So if you haven't seen it or considireing watch Angel Beats! just do it. It's only 13 episodes and it's amazing XD,459,724,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First time Let's Review! Angel beats is a great anime that takes place in the Video Game style world between life and reincarnation. The music is amazing and animation is beautiful what more do you need vivid colours is that thing. So what I meant about a Video Game style is that there are NPCs and death doesn't exist but there is obliteration which is gone you leave the world permanently. The characters are loveable and funny and all have sad storys to tell because that's how you get into this world . So the ending all I'm gonna say is accept it and don't ask for more because it's never coming but the ending is good none the less. Final Verdict is a 8/10 this is a enjoyable anime that will touch your heart by the end if you connect with the characters but repetitive jokes aren't funny [yeah I'm looking at you  Christ ] and some characters just didn't appear as much as they could have but that was only one or two anyway I highly recommend to give this a watch it's very enjoyable.,462,727,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Angel Beats. Is the saddest most heart wrecnhing story i have ever seen in a tv show or anime series. By the end of the series i was a emotional wreck and that is a high praise seeing as it takes alot to get me teary eyed.,467,732,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really when I first started watching this series I was expecting a show that focused more on things like action and comedy then anything else.  To which I was pretty right about.  Throughout most of the series I spent quite a bit of time either being entertained by either some pretty decent action or some fairly good humor.  The thing that I wasn't expecting however was how strong both the characters and story turned out being.  In the beginning it just seemed like a fairly standard show about a group of people trying to defeat their enemy.  But as story begins to develop and some depth starts to get added to the characters the show takes on something a little deeper and it becomes somewhat hard not to get somewhat attached to the characters.  There were a couple of points when I surprisely found my eyes getting watery which I found to be a pleasant surprise that the show could actually affect me in such a manner.  In all actually even that became somewhat humorous that a show could be funny and sad at the same time.  From beginning to end the show stayed at the top of its game and even now I find myself going back to watch the show every now and then.,468,733,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story is largely predictable though still enjoyable. For me the strength of the show was the comedy aspects and the many interesting characters. However half the episodes take a more serious tone and for drama fans this is fine but wasn't that it enjoyable for me. Animation and music were solid. ,469,734,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay so this anime is yummy from the start...or maybe that isn't quite the correct word. It is an absolutely amazing anime with cute funny bits but chock full of juicie drama bits. The last episode alone would warrant a 10 stars out of 5. The first episode alone is awesome and it just keeps getting better!,483,747,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel Beats is a very good anime it was very entertaining throughout the whole thing I like that It told a story about teenagers who didn't accept they deaths at first and couldn't pass on in life and let they soul rest in peace but pretty much I recommend that everyone watch this anime ,484,748,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Intro,485,749,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For me this was an enjoyable anime. It brings sadness and laughs and in combination with some action this was a good mix imo. There are some people who say they didn't like this  mixing of genres  because  the show doesn't know what it wants to be  but i disagree. It's a show about life (and death) itself so I find it quite logical that there are happy/funny moments as well as sad moments.,486,750,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime has to be one of the saddest animes I will ever watch. At first I didn't know what was happening but by the third epsisode it started making sense. I think this has one of the best storylines ever. In the end it all makes sense about what characters do what. Even though we don't get to see all of the tragic passes of most of the characters I think it would just end up being a more sad anime than an action one. Overall this teaches us that we should accept our lives for what they are instead of trying to resist them.,487,751,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Love this anime! Story is of high school kids who are stuck in Limbo in a high school (what adults don't go to Limbo?). Love Otonashi and Yuri characters. The OP is one of the best ones I have ever heard while the ending song is really good too. The last two episodes are bittersweet for the characters but the ending leaves you happy. A must see.,488,752,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let me say this to start: This is a fairly superb series. There are some problems with it like any series though but first let me talk about the scores. I had originally planned to give characters somewhere of a 6-7 score. This is because in all honesty while the characters who were featured were very well done most of the cast goes unheard of. But after remembering just how much I loved the characters who were touched upon I couldn't give it anything lower.,489,753,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is at the top of my list having just seen it. It blow me away the concept of a purgatory like place where one has to escape from or become absorbed by is not a new one but this anime made it feel unique.,490,754,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of the best animes I've ever watched. It's both hilarious and also touching. I've also read on a Japanese forum somewhere that this girl used to think anime was only for otakus and nerds and it's super lame : Until they watched this anime.

I myself like another review by alphy came as a result of the need to create a more balanced view of Angel Beats! rather then a classic perfect score review. However he's a little more harsh then I am on the anime :p. ,505,766,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a very impressive and worth watching anime .,506,767,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Angel beats gave me a different anime feel than most Starting out with him being dropped off with amnesia To him making friends with the so called 'Enemy' And doing many more So many flashbacks/Things that made me sad Then with the great ending..That more or less made me cry Since you just gave up almost ALL the characters you learnt to love.,507,768,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well this show was one that honestly took me by surprise. This show is about a guy who wakes up next to a girl who tells him he is no longer alive. This made me watch the entire series and honestly it has everything. There is comedy a good plot action very sad near the end and romance although that doesn't take place until the last episode which I have to say honestly you will be really pissed after watching the last episode mainly because your crying through that episode non stop then it pulls some crap that just plain makes you pissed out of your mind so if you hate anime that will just leave you pissed after watching them don't watch this. However the characters are just incredible in this series and you really get to know them all which brings the sadness when you are at the last episode and the best part is the main character isn't an ugly retarded looking douchebag that should at best be a comic relief character like the Kanokon series however that kid was just a Justin Bieber clone anyways. Well back to the topic I would say watch this if you like good plots that have incredible characters along with great stories behind them.,508,769,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gungrave delivers on the promise made by other bloody stories where the protagonist and antagonist are two sides of the same coin. I would go so far as to say that it succeeds where the legendary Trigun and Berserk (the two obvious influences) came up short. Most of all Gungrave is an exercise in badassery and timeless cool.,520,781,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The mafia in American cinema is always in my opinion incredibly unrealistic. Ether they depict them far to harshly such as in early 20s block busters like or are in my opinion far to kind to them in classics like the godfather.  But every so often a piece of art depicts them realistically without to much romantic heroism but not to much despicable villainy. Gungrave is one of those rare occasions. The story revolves around two young juvenile delinquents Brandon heat and harry McDowell. After tragedy strikes them they both end up joining the crime syndicate known as millineom and end up working with the infamous crime boss big daddy. In what results is an incredibly intelligent and emotional journey throw organized crime and there different experiences and mindsets to it. The story is well told and is filled with emotion and well thought out scenarios. Absolutely nothing done in this amine is unnecessary . Every frame event twist and every turn is done to help tell this brilliant story as a whole. The animation in this anime is brilliant and incredibly detailed. The use of light and shadowing is brilliant and helps insight emotion when need be. This series has incredible voice acting in both the sub and the dub so i cant really recommended just one. Also in sound t eh opining and ending themes to this series are a pleasure to lisen to and completely fit the mood and themes of the series. All the characters are superb and well taught out and all have there own motives and complicated past's. I only have one complaint about this series and that is the first episode. Ill be frank the first episode does not make any since unless you have seen the rest of the series. But it holds it purpose mainly so you dont go what the fuck later on in the series. But even thow the first episode is preempt bad the ending more then makes up for it and is in my opinion the best ending to anything i have ever seen. I can not recommend gun grave enough and give at a 10 out of 10 and my highest recommendations. And plese mind my spelling :) I know it sucks.,524,785,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Two main characters (Harry McDowel & Brandon Heat) are friends from childhood and always keep with each other. Later the're joining to heartless mafia (Millenion) with living (not only animating) characters where everyone of them had his/her own soul. You can emapthise with characters and like or dislike every single one of the main characters.,525,786,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,526,787,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of my personal Fav's here I cant say exactly what it is just that a story has never been so…godfather like to me. Shows the story of 2 young men climb there way to the top of the mafia (Millenium) one for power and glory the other for love. Then their spiral into seperate lives to ultimately lead to a sad and devestating end simply amazing they say it was based off a game...but seriously unlike every other game this one makes you wonder,527,788,2019-04-13 21:35:40

January 2013: It was a time when I was a mere rookie when it comes to Anime. Sure I had seen my fair share of overhyped shounen series like Dragonball Z and Pokémon but that was back when I wasn't even aware that any of those shows belonged to a bigger something. It was when I joined Anime-Planet that a whole new world opened up to me.,537,798,2019-04-13 21:35:40

After watching service x servent i was recomended Working and by god i'm glad i watched both seasons. I couldnt stop lauging after each episode it was so good I had to get both seasons in one day. This is a great comedy with a slice of life theme with great characters who are intresting and never get boring even though they do the same job everyday. I'm still waiting for season 3 I have high hopes since the mangas going on but I need the love storys between some o the characters and for yamadas brother to finally realise that his sister been there entire time/,540,801,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There's barely any reason to rate this above even a 1 but I only gave it a 2 because the dubbed version was actually decent but good dubbing for this is like trying to polish a turd it can't be done. All it is is the girls either molesting each other or stripping each other nothing more (although I will give the 3rd one credit it wasn't the worst). ,544,804,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Giant Killing was a show that I had high hopes for that in the end just couldn't deliver. The premise of the show managed to be both worn out and new at the same time. You have a lack luster sports team that is struggling to stay afloat and a new coach comes with lofty goals and a plan to turn things around through strategy. I've seen this played out in western media a lot but this is the first time I had seen it in an anime. ,550,809,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is an anime that actually crept up on me especially its characters. But we'll get to them later on. First order of business is the story. I found that there wasn't much originality when it came to how the story played out if you haven't finished watching this one I won't spoil it for you. It seriously needed work that is all. As for the animation this one wasn't to bad most of the lighting and setting were done very nicely. The sound wasn't too bad as well could have used a bit more ambiance in some scenes more than others but that's my opinion. Now on to what sells this anime the characters. All done very nicely with a not to shabby back story if you actually pay attention. I had to watch this one twice just to be certain prior to my writing this review. Over this anime will get a nice 8 out of 10. I just felt that this anime was rushed and has lots of potential. Lets see what happens in the future for this title.,555,814,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well this episode is definitely not what I expected. But it is still an episode. I mean the first episode or missing episode (or whatever you want to call it) from Corpse party.I would not understand it very well if I did not watch the whole serie.

I honestly love the original story so I may have a bias towards this but I defnitely feel I wouldn't have enjoyed this as much if I hadn't read Kafka's story first. I really loved the animation it really gave the feel that I believe that Kafka was looking for an interpretation that did the story justice far as the artwork. My only issue with it was it just seemed lacking..it felt rushed I know in the story it doesn't get deep into the characters too much but i kind of felt like the story and plot was rushed because I didn't have the same reaction as I did when I read the story it didn't hit me as deeply. The artwork seemed to be the main focus in my opinion and I wonder if the creator of this was forced to fit that 20 min or so mark because I felt like things just could have been done better but that is just my personal opinion. Anyways I still really enjoyed this my only advice would be to read his story before you watch this its great:),569,828,2019-04-13 21:35:40
(this really isn't much of a review but like a background on my experience with it) I am by no means an anime veteran. I have only seen a few anime but this one was the first anime I watched that wasn't generic (naruto etc). I remember really liking it at first because of its characters and it being funny. Now im in a position where the more anime I watch the less I like this show. No matter my opinion on whether this is a good or bad anime I will still like to thank it for getting me into anime even if I think its rather mediocre,570,829,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Lucky Star is a anime that you are gonna hurt yourself laughing. The main characters are all unique and lovable in there own way. First is Konata the easily bored prankster (Easily the best in my opinion). Second Kagami the hard working of the two twins. Tsukasa the laid-back cutie of the two twins. Finally Miyuki the Know-it-all Moe stereotype. Not forgetting the Lucky Channel idol Akira Kogami and her assistant Minoru Shiraishi. The animation is beautiful it really uses the vivid colours and the music is great I always loved the end because of the karaoke it was always a different song really giving variety. This anime also has tons of references like one episode has Guile from Street Fighter and another has Phoenix Wright. In all a great anime that will have you laughing for hours with a total of 24 episodes and 1 OVA. ,585,842,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Let me put it this way this is anime does NOT have a storyline. It's mainly about 4 high school girls always trying to enjoy their lives and get their last two years of high school done. The anime is pretty random sometimes and it also has humor thrown in too so you might get a good laugh every now and then it's better than having boring parts but this anime doesn't however you might hear a lot of conversations.. :P And I forgot to mention that there is also anime parodies like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya at some points during the anime but keep in mind that they are not in every episode.

Lucky Star is a 24 episode slice-of-life comedy anime chock full of parodies and references to everything anime. Featuring chibi visuals and a cast of almost only female characters (mainly high school girls) this looks like a recipe for disaster and cringe. Yet… it isn’t. Don’t expect any plot none here as it’s a bunch of random scenes stitched together on some sort of timeline but plenty of laughs are to be had even with the adorable style. Despite the horde of Japanese cultural references this anime is best watched as the English dub version. An anime that even a cynic like me could appreciate.,596,853,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay this is actually my first time reviewing this anime show called Lucky Star. Before I started to review it theres actually a lot of reviews about it. Some have positive some have negative reviews. I'm going to be one of the positive reviewers for this one. When I first saw Lucky Star it has a fun sort of talk conversation including food culture video games anime and etc. There's also anime parodies including The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and stuff like that. They even discuss about certain real stuff that parts of the subtitles were censored and I can hardly recognize it. Maybe if I buy the whole season the subtitles might be uncensored. Anyway moving on. ,600,857,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hanaukyo Maid Team is a harem anime where a guy that makes Shinji Ikari look super macho inherits a large mansion and an all-female staff. He's suddely given everything a teenage boy could want: wealth and a lot of sexy babes surrounding him willing to cater to his every need. So what does he do? Wilt like an old flower. This is especially true when the triplet maids Lemon Marron and Melon show they're there to take care of any sexual needs he may have. Watch this only if you love fanboy service without a strong plot. About the only redeeming feature of this is the opening theme song  Voice of Heart.  ,607,864,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tokyo Mew Mew isn't perfect. There are some things that are amazing but there is also a lot that could have been done much better. I love nekomimi and the main chacter being part cat was what originally drew me in. Overall it is a decent series.,614,871,2019-04-13 21:35:40

My ratings are all based on my opinions of the show when I was younger which is why it's a perfect score.  All in all Tokyo Mew Mew (Mew Mew Power in the english version) made my childhood.  Although it may not be my favorite anime anymore it was extremely creative to me when I was little and to be honest I still like it even now.  The artwork is splendid as well.  The characters may not be very complex but the storyline itself though kind of cliched has many twists and turns that will keep you watching the show until the end.,616,873,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Nana will always be a close favorite of mine. This show had strong female charaters and a great soundtrack! I even have many of the songs on my phone to listen to. The style of the show is also very unique. I do sometimes however have problems with the body proportions of the males and the females but I have grown used to that. I only wish that the manga was finished so that we could get more anime of Nana. ,627,884,2019-04-13 21:35:40
NANA's STORY is presented nearly flawlessly following two young girls both with the name of  Nana .  Nana Osaki has moved to Tokyo to pursue her dream of becoming a rockstar while Nana Komatsu (later called Hachi or Hachiko) is following her boyfriend.  What begins as an innocent meeting on a train turns into a deep friendship that borders on the line of romance.  Although not incredibly original the story is presented in such a way that it will have you fascinated the entire time.,629,885,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Love the hell outta this anime! One of my favorites for sure. Again the ending left me hanging a little but yeah. Maybe I should actually read the manga someday...haha.,630,886,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of the things I like to see the most in anime is how they portray relationships. I’m a sucker for romance but I hate the cheesy stuff you usually see in typical shoujo anime. Sometimes you’ll find an anime with realistic characters with the typical flaws of human nature and usually people love them. We can identify with them. Like in Evangelion many people who have dealt with depression could identify with Shinji (in some levels…). For those of you who have watched your share of anime about love/relationships I bet you could identify somehow with “Bokura ga Ita” “Kimi ga Nozomu Eien” or “Kare Kano”. Or at least you felt connected with its characters. I have watched them all and know what I’m talking about.,636,892,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show is highly addictive. When I started I wasn't that attached to any of the characters. I picked out all their character flaws yet at the same time both Nanas had this fun vibe. Nana K. is (as Nana O. later states) just like a puppy and Nana O. was both cool and fun. ,642,895,2019-04-13 21:35:40

ahhh this anime drove me nuts! i got through it quickly because it was a total soap opera and you had to know what happened next with all the relationship drama llama yada yada but it left me very unsatisfied.  I thought all the  crazy things that were happening were important like at the end it would all mean something or it all had a reason but the way it ended it just kind of trickled off.  So I guess you could say this anime is an accurate depiction of adult life- important relationships trickle off pride keeps you from the most important things and people having to decide between love and security that type of thing. But after about 20 episode of this it wasn't entertaining to watch anymore.  Especially with all the dramatic flashbacks from both nana's in the beginning and ending of each episode I really thought something big was coming.  Similarly I thought she meant it when she said she had a plan to get nana back and i was wondering what she meant when she said  but i forgot about one thing.   I was absolutely sick when she chose Takumi over Nobu and then never came to her senses.  I was absurd the way she claimed to be so in love with this man after what she said herself was a one night stand that she regretted. Then she waits months for him to call and calls him her boyfriend and can't get over him or give him up for someone who she wants so badly.  I really was terrified that she'd choose a man who I saw forced her into sex several times.  She never seemed to regain her relationship with nana either.  I wanted nobu to fight for her i wanted nana to go after her.  I was so disappointed with the ending. I've never seen two anime characters more convincingly crazy over each other and they gave it up.  None of it seemed to have much point in the end so many things left unresolved.  I guess after awhile I'll see some meaning in the choices they all made or maybe I'll learn from their mistakes but right now I'm just ticked off with the whole story.,649,901,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Nana is a 47 episode josei drama romance anime with themes of music. I ignore older anime due to having too many anime to watch but this anime was recommended to me by someone who seems to enjoy unique anime they also warned me Nana Komatsu is annoying. And then I find out this anime is 47 episodes long! Disclaimer: I have trouble watching long anime series and I also hate love-triangles harems and ecchi. This sure is a unique anime it definitely feels like a shoujo (josei) anime with some adult-oriented themes. Thus this probably not one to watch for folks who dislike those sorts of anime. The strength of this anime is what viewers can learn from it especially considering it has a very realistic setting and the relationships are believeable the concept of love is much like that in real life. Which is a bad thing for fictional romance… (As one would find out were they to read the rant).,653,905,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Deemed to be Studio Ghibli's worst film; I went in thinking 'it's from Studio Ghibli how bad can it be?'. I don't know if I'm looking to deeply into it but this is possibley one of the worst film I have ever seen and it all comes from the story and the character the two biggest parts of the film and they fuck it up.,667,916,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show was kinda love hate for me. It took the magical girl type and made it a little bit more interesting but not enough to make it really good. I honestly don't know what they could have done to make it better but something needed to be there.

       Alright so this was the magical girl show for the season. It's about two sisters Urin and Marin who live in the ocean (they aren't mermaids but need a special ring to breath out of water). They decide to visit the sky world to return a ring that was dropped in the water. The owner Kanon turns out to be a evil/emo girl who threw it away. The girls then release an evil spirit called Sedna; A talking turtle gives Marin and Kanon the power to transform into the Sea and Sky Maidens to defeat it. So. Not very original. However this show is a bit more mature than other magical girl shows. It's not all sparkles transformations and whatnot. Which makes it less girly and a bit more original and less repetative.,671,920,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Plot:  When Marin and Urin – two sisters who live in the sea – find a ring thatropped into the water from the land of Sky they decided to travelbove to return it. There amidst a bustling festival they meet theing’s owner; her name is Kanon and she wants nothing to do with theing which was a present by her ex-boyfriend. After Kanon refuses toccept the ring and throws it away once more the girls continue toearch for it accidentally releasing half of a great evil whose spiritas sealed both above and below the water.  But luckily there’s hope –atsumoto the Elder Turtle from the sea appears and reveals that Marins none other than the Priestess of the Sea charged with defeating theillain. Marin must now fight alongside Kanon - who discovers she’s theriestess of the Sky - to put a stop to this ancient power and itsossessed minions before it’s too late…  (site synopsis),673,921,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I had the chance to actually see the movie premier in San Francisco Japantown and it was a mind blowing experience. The story basically covers the 2nd half of Gurren Lagann and Gainax was kind enough to put in a lot of new things in the movie (thats for you to watch out for) and if you haven't seen Gurren Lagann or Gurren-Hen then why are you watching Lagann-Hen??? ANYWAY!!! Overall the story was basically the same(no drastic changes to the story). The animation was beautiful!!! colors filled the screen as Simon and Team Dai Gurren battle the Anti Spiral. Gainax always brings the best. The sound... J-Pop blasting during epic Ganmen explosions and when you hear  ROW ROW FIGHT DAH POWAH!!!  you want to scream as well right??? Gurren Lagann was all about the characters. Now in Lagann-Hen there is a twist that i won't spoil but the characters will bring the most epic battle you have ever seen. I have been a big fan of Gurren Lagann for a really long time and i love the series to death. Gurren Lagann will be an anime that everyone will be talking about in the future.

This is just a short music video extra that came bundled with the Blu-Raybox set for the Another series. It is basically just a series of pictures of a chibified Mei Misaki in various settings set to a light ballad. It has very little animation just some Flash movement for the background and none of the pictures of Mei herself are animated. The uncredited song is pleasant but unremarkable.,681,927,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a tricky one to opinionate on since it's just a part of the movie Kill Bill no longer than 10 minutes probably. I was so stoked to see this part of the film it's so awesome. I absolutely adore the anime style. The story and characters are hard to rate though because we don't really get too much detail. I wish it was longer! Though I truly wish that they would come up with something like this more and for it to be an original project - That would be ABSOLUTELY amazing in my opinion.,683,929,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of my favorite old time shows I have to say. A wandering swordsman who only wishes to have a good life without the problems of his past. It’s a story that is used many times over but what Rurouni Kenshin does that many of the others don’t seem to do is make more of a comedy then a drama romance. The characters are pretty loveable and you can feel for their stories even some of the enemies have a rather sweet sad story behind them.,695,941,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I enjoyed this anime. It's old so the animation wasn't great but I don't think that it took much away from my enjoyment of the anime. The story line was fair revloving around a retired assassin who has  sworn off killing.It swiched between episodic filler episodes and longer archs that didn't really connect to eachother. The main character's past seems to be the uniting factor of the series. In my opinon the high point of this anime really is the main character. He's sweet protective and kind with just enough of a complicated past and internal stuggle to make him interesting. He's the kind of character you wish would stop being so nice and think about himself for once. He not only holds the story together but makes it entertaining intersting and engaging.,696,942,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Despite the fact Rurouni Kenshin did have a cult following I myself being one of them at the time I feel that this anime could have been something better. The story was pretty solid for the first 20 some odd episodes but then it just went all over the place during the last 30. I kind of felt lost at times and literally re-watched every single episode a few times just to see if I missed anything. As for the animation it felt a bit rushed. The sounds and music were pretty cool. The characters are by far both cool and weird. Kenshin himself is cool working along side Miss Karou. But then as the story progressed all the other characters seemed as though they were just a spur of the moment type of thing. Overall I give this anime a 7.5/10 overall and here's why... I liked the concept and Kenshin's back story which could have played out more in the anime but thankfully was explained in the movie but the art direction could have been better. Everything seemed rushed to me but I still liked it regardless.,704,943,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Don’t let the title of romantic tales of the meiji fool you it not all mushy gushy and they even flash back to the Edo period hence the strong enforcement on the Shinsengumi in particular Hajime Saito Kenshins arch rival. This story is based on truth while pushing the fiction. In my top ten becasue i simply love the in depth plot which circles around samurai X but reveals the happy times rather than the gut renching sadness of the before and after. This is a long series but i know you will not look back and regret it.,712,951,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gakuen Alice for me was very average nothing really special. The animation was very cute as a little kid anime. As a matter of fact this anime is a very little kid kind of anime. It woudent be one of my faverot it would be good to just watch it if you have nothing to do but some times it would get you bored. It wasent anything to get to exated for very simple.,723,959,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gakuen Alice was a very interesting series that I've watch.It captures my heart at moment(making me cry)but also show the strong bond of the characters and the friendly(and funny) relationship between them.If you were disappointed at how the anime series endsthen stop being so disappointed! Because the reason that Mikan have come to the academymade good friends and found out about herself.Was all because of Hotaru leaving and Mikan wanting her to come back(which resolve in Mikan coming to the academy)....The way that the anime series end was pretty goodwith Hotaru not leaving...The producer stopped the anime at a right point where it didn't have to go any further.It was goodbut to tell you the truth...I was disappointed like you guys when the anime series ended,725,961,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have to say even though I've seen a lot of harem animes this was one of the best. Mainly because that even though it's set in a sort of magical/fantasy world w/ magicdemonsgods and such it still had a much more realistic/serious feel at times as the characters deal w/ their feelings as the plot progresses.,727,962,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story - I was enjoying until the last few episodes. I don't get it. Why would all these girls ( especially Sia) be trying to get this guys attention the whole time show and then by the end he so into a girl who showed no interest in him at all. I mean if I were in that position I would of laid Asa out a long time ago for smacking me in the back so much. I think he went with the wrong choice.,729,963,2019-04-13 21:35:40

immediately this anime had so many turn offs.  It was so. . . . I dont even know that you can say cliches.  It was just stupid.  I mean I like some good romance that requires some character building blood sweat and tears fitting into an anime that usually falls under the shounen.  I watched Rosario Vampire and that one was ok not great but it was less. . . . .cliched then this one.  I already hate the main character too.  Hes an idiot and the voice actor was lame. anyways I really dont think you should watch this one.  There are other animes that are harems that are about 50 times better.  Go watch Rosario Vampire if you really want something like this.  ,736,969,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show was very good. It is a little hard to get into right away and at some points you just want the story to move along but when you get past episode 3 the show seems to really pick up. When you start to really meet and see the characters the show begins to take some crazy twists and gets very good. I loved this show. It was one of the better animated series I have seen. It was a bit emotional near the end.,738,970,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It has lively characters some more than others. It represents real drama better than any sitcom or reality without making you want to stop. When it really gets into which girl he is going to choose you will feel as if you are the one who has the choice. It also shows grief and addiction that makes you scared at points but you will not want to look away. It has one thing that many animes do not and that is a great conclussion. This is a must watch.,740,971,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The quality of this Anime is technically pretty godd but for me it was just to plain boring its just telling the story in the most conviniet way no drama. The Characters suffer from this the most because they become just puppets that are allready after 6 episodes totally tranparent. A bit of drama or problems that needed to be overcome would helped the story a lot but so far its 24 Episodes of sunshine...,750,979,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series is a mixture of comedy drama romance and a few more conspicuous topics such as illness death human experimentation and personal identity. Every few episodes especially in the latter half of the series they liked to throw something controversial or deep at you to stave off the repetitiveness of the romance and comedy. Finally they ended the series with something very unusual for the harem genre: A choice. That's right the main character actually chooses a single girl instantly making this series better than the vast majority of the muck that calls itself a harem. That being said I will get onto the review proper.,755,984,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I started watching anime again because of this. The anime is actually really good for some fanservice anime. It got serious at times and made me catch feels. The plot can be dumb at times but its also really interesting mysterious and intricate. You won't be dissapointed by this anime. It is different in its own style and unfortunately very short. The vocals and animation are superb. The character development is lacking besides the last episode or two. Great anime.,783,7,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Asobi ni Iku yo! it's a basic concept that has been done before.  A human like alien with some cat like features lands on earth and for some strange reason or another she becomes interested in the male lead and from there the story pretty much follow the standard pattern that we've all seen before.  Some other group of aliens are also on the planet and this other group as well as several other groups try their best to mess up relations between the humans and the aliens.  The animation was pretty standard for what you would expect for an anime coming out in 2010.  It looks nice and it doesn't try to do anything new or interesting.   As for the sound the opening and ending I didn't really care for them all that much and the soundtrack throughout the series was easily forgettable.  As for the voice acting they were pretty good and were something of a bright spot since some of the actors are people they I rather enjoy hearing.  The characters it featured the standard harem class.  The childhood friend the classmate who has a crush the newcomer and the male lead who seems oblivious to everything.  IF you're expecting anything new in terms of cast then look somewhere else because they are pretty much generic.  But if you're watching this then I'm pretty sure you may not really care all the much.,791,13,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Super Robot Wars: OG Divine Wars is an anime adaptation of the Gameboy Advanced game Super Robot Wars: Original Generation (unless you played this game in America where it is known as Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation. Why the name change? Because  Wars  wasn't  anime  enough for American audiences. Just a guess.) Having said that this review is comparing the anime to the source material and is therefore a little judgemental. Okay okay. Very judgemental.,819,34,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A lot of people did not really like this movie for many reasons. I parsonally loved this movie. Maybe what people didnt like was the fact how it ended. In my opinian the fact that they both end up in this other world is not so bad. I you think about ut it would have been a bit wear if they both got to stay in the real world with there body's. I mean you know they have been throw a lot and sure maybe some people are thinking oh they have gone throw a lot so they should be alowed to be happy in there world. But I think that its kind of a happy ending because they got to be togheter at the end with there body's. So I dont really know whats so bad about that ending. Sure they left some of they people they loved and yea the first time I watched it I was like are you serious thats how the movie ended but then I thought about it and then I was like this was not actiolly that bad of an ending and overall it made a lot of meaning and things where connectad preatty well.,820,35,2019-04-13 21:35:40

With The Conqueror of Shamballa I feel as though the anime creators were able to have some relief from their struggle with the source material of the Fullmetal Alchemist series. Partly because they made the anime before Hiromu Arakawa finished the manga there was always that tension to keep true to the basic outlines of the plot and characterizations of the manga as much as possible while still pursuing their own altered version of the story. But when Edward Elric clapped his hands together and transmuted himself into our own world at the closing of the series they finally left the confines of Hiromu Arakawa’s plans for her story and transmuted her characters and inventions into their own territory.,822,37,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I noticed that there's alot of people that want to watch this movie including myself. I went looking for it on a site I use often & found it! The site is VeeHD.com. I'm not quite sure how or if it works on a computer becuase I use this forum & that site on my PS3. You have to create an account on there but it's completely & so is downloading movies off the site. After you create an account & sign in(if you're not signed in it wont work) search the title of you movie & find the one that best suits you. Once you find the one you like select it it'll bring up a video window. Below the video there will be a tab that says download click that. That will bring up a blue lettering on the video window click the blue lettering. Your PS3 will bring up a menu asking where you would like to save it to select the one you want & it should start the download. I really liked this movie. The plot was good. It was lacking in little areas but was good for the most part. I thought it was kinda weird they made Al look like Ed though. LOL I hope this helps some of you get to watch it. If you have any trouble you can contact me through this site. ,823,38,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ohm..yeah. So the original Fullmetal alchemist series didnt have an ending and endings are always needed. So lets make one. As a stand-alone movie this wouldnt even be all that bad. Its original action packed looks good too bad it has anything to do with FMA. I recommend watching FMA Brotherhood dont even watch the original series it doesnt have anything in plus compared to the new one. About Shambala....I dont know what to recommend. The story barely has enything to do with FMA itll still contain a few spoilers i guess so dont watch it before FMAB but if you watch it after you will be amazed how bad it is. So yeah. Maybe watch this if you dont plan on wathing the series at all. ,831,44,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There's not a lot I want to say about UPS that one couldn't figure out on it's first or second episode. This show was obviously targeted towards younger people probably the exact age as those portrayed little wonder. On the surface you have 7 pre-teen to teen-aged kids stranded on a planet filled with hostile flora and fauna. Underneath you get a coming of age and friendship story of some quality. For someone my age it's wholly forgettable for someone around their young teen years could be an awesome anime.,845,57,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hardcore my ass. If you're expecting nudity you won't find it here. Though just as well it isn't hardcore otherwise it would literally be porn (hentai). But it isn't. Just a shit tonne of panty shots and pervy shit. Nothing actually happens. On multiple occasions the girls try to make things intimate with Junichi. But obviously he is a coward harem protagonist so he'd rather run away than say get a blowjob by his big-boobed childhood friend. Nobody sleeps with him which would be the only thing to improve this crap. Among the most pointless OVAs why would anyone watch this?,846,58,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Gakuen Heaven is a shonei ai anime but there isn't much there to get scandalised about. There isn't much there. Period. It's set in an all-boys academy Liberty Bell  BL  for short - and they hammer it into you at the beginning of each and every episode so you'd have to be dumb not to get it. Our protagonist receives out of the blue an invitation to study in this prestigious academy but doesn't understand why he was selected not having any particular  talent  to boast. The real plot kicks in around episode 7 or so so more than half of the anime is basically filler dedicated to introducing the characters. Which are all very handsome boys. Similarly to in other shonen ai anime there isn't a single female character - I always find this fact amusing. ,848,59,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I started watching this without high expectations and was pleasently surprised. It is a comedy with a good story line. I found it quite enjoyable. The humor is pretty clean and not overdone. There is a good bit of action a small bit of magic person in a strange world and even a dabble of mystery. By the time I was half way through I was looking to see if there was another season but to my dismay there is not. ,886,95,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The animation is great and the comedy is good but the characters are eye-rollingly stereotypical (I mean seriously could Emi get anymore tsundere?) and the story is just a mish-mash of over-done cliches. The creators even had to throw in some fanservice and you know you're in trouble when you're making an anime about Satan working at McDonalds but you need a shot of a girl taking her shirt of to keep people interested.,892,101,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is going to be very brief and short review because I found this way too hilarious to take seriously as it's comedy is aces and goes with the story absolutely brilliantly in Hataraku Maou-sama (The Devil is a Part Timer). All in all the characters are hilarious the overall comedy is brilliant and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys their comedy with a little bit of magic thrown into the mix. Animation and sound have no issues. The only mark this anime drops the ball is where the story is left hung out open with no end to it. Now this can be interpreted in many ways but I just don't like this kind of ending. There needs to be some kind of closure or else there isn't any kind of ending it just stops. Imagine listening to some music about three quarters of the way through and then it just stops for no apparent reason. That is kind of how I felt with this ending and all the other animes that seem to follow this kind of endings. Hopefully some kind of sequel will be made to amend this but till then this is how this review will stand.,896,105,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,897,106,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this is something you should watch when you're extremely bored or after watching a long series that drained you mentally since The Devil Is a Part-Timer! is so light hearted and the whole series can be considered as comedic relief. i loved the animation in this everything from character design to all the backdrops. this compensates for the fighting scenes as someone else had said making them seem more intense than they really are because it's obvious by the second episode that you can't take this series seriously. although any seriousness was close to zero it didn't bother me and i enjoyed it. the ending was left open and i found the last episode to be incredibly anti-climatic and an unnecessary and a kind of stupid way to reaffirm the peace between the characters. finish it in a day and move on. ,898,107,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a show that I thought- I'd really like to read the manga- because I could tell that the 13 episodes were just getting the story going a little.  The premise is so strange and so star-crossed that I'd really like to know how it plays out when Emi and Maou inevitably fall in love and how the author will handle the fact that we're all ignoring- Maou is the DEVIL. He's not the good guy.  He can't skip off into the sunset in the end he's got a job to do and it involves hell.  Anyway I know this one was popular but it wasn't that great.  The first episode was really hilarious bravo.  But after that it was just moments here and there that were funny like any other anime so it wasn't truly a funny anime just a little ridiculous in theme.  But once you get used to that theme it's just like a normal shoujo and it has to work for its laughs like any other and it doesn't.  Most of the episodes were boring but I really enjoyed the few moments of action here and there.  I'm cutting the thing a break because I really think if it went on it could have ended up being something better.  I'm guessing the anime producers didn't have a ton to work with because it's a relatively new manga.  ,899,108,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Most people can say that 10 is a little too high score. I don't concur. If you like shounen with powerful battle scenes and good lot of humour. This a anime for you. This review is about Hunter X Hunter as a whole. Not just the first season. Hunter X Hunter have it's own little originality you seldom find in the mainstream anime. Then I'm talking about the nen-abilities which is an easy enough concept to grasp but also holds a lot of depth. The characters are in general shounen type of guys but very colourful. The story have everything you want. You see the main-character grow and has to endure hellish training. It even has an arena fight. Everyone likes a good arena fight. Colosseum wasn't built for nothing.,905,114,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The show was more or less just  eh . The Plot was fairly entertaining but it was like they were trying too hard. I honestly had high expectations based on the reviews I have seen but once again just  eh . Honestly the character development could have been done better. They did attempt you give you a little backround but it was still very dry you only invest your emotions into the characters to an extent well atleast in my opinion...Other than that the action was pretty mediocre and for a vampire series everything was too clean it didn't have that gritty look to it. Most of the actions scenes it seemed too easy there just wasn't a lot to them regardless of how beat up some characters did gety wasn't that much of a challenge just the main character's carelessness in his case. But other than the characters and the fight scenes the series was kind of too bright for a vampire series in my opinion but everything else was well done. The show was entertaining and people are waiting for the next season. This one is just an anime that you could go both ways matter of opinionit is not a must watch but it is ok for the most part. So if its on your list then enjoy but I wouldn't make a big rush to get to it takes a certain taste. Personally wish I would've spent my time with something else first,938,144,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Time to kick it old school with some REAL vampires! Black Blood Brothers is one of a few vampire animes that's good for us middle-men(that is to say there's not a whole lot of romance but not a whole lot of gore either). It's not full of blood squirts and head ripping but it's by no means pansy core. With funny characters good fight scenes and a little bit of drama to top it all off BBB is a great anime to look into. Go check it out for yourself! ~Tea,941,146,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Black Blood Brothers is finally now one of my all-time favourites. The story telling was great the style in which in the end 2 timelines are merged and all questions are answered was brilliantly executed. The Universe of the vampires in this anime was very believable. The animation was great with the characters looking very believable and not to mention cute! But the part that needs a special mention is the character art. This anime had one of the most beautiful representation that I've ever seen of the characters. There was this one scene where the protagonist had just found something after thinking it was lost. He was in genuine pain but was unable to cry but also at the same time happy because he just found what he thought was lost. The entire emotion was drawn on his face. You could tell all those emotions just by looking at that face for those few seconds even if the dialogue wasn't there. I was actually sad to see the series end in just 12 eps. But the ending does have enough room for a sequel or two or even short OVAs. So I'll be eagerly waiting for the sequel or OVA's release when they do just like with Code Geass.,942,147,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Based on the starting eposide I was ready for a good story and romance. However within 3 episodes the male protagonist became so annoying and irritating that I stopped watching it. Only my habit of finishing any series once started made me pick it up again and finish the series. I found that all the characters half-baked and the end even more so.,953,154,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Where to start with this anime... Basically it's a pretty average not veryriginal ecchi/harem anime that involves a high school student named Yuuri Mitoinding a relic of some sort that was dug up and then later coming back to itt night and bringing his friends with him to the relic to perform a ritual ont. One of his friends who is named Ameri Kawai ends up getting on aotorcycle that Yuuri brought earlier in order to leave and instead ends upmashing into the relic with it on accident breaking it and causing a bunch ofvil/misguided beings called  Tayutai  out along with a white hairedittle girl with a giant hammer called Mashiro Mito.,956,155,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Nice little magical show with some pretty funny comedy herend there. There was quite a bit more drama then comedy though. I think what Iiked the most about this show was the ending. It was a pretty predictablending but the protagonist made his choice and there was even a future scenehich looked very pretty might I add. I enjoyed this one quite a bit.,957,156,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Just to start the show was pretty good but after the 10th episode i was ready to punch myself in the face to say the least. The characters background was not gone through enough and left to many questions unanswered like why did the makers of this anime have to make characters that have strange pasts yet they dont seem to go into them at all. The sound and animation was ok but the story left to many holes that needed to be patched. If the story was a ship then this ship has so many holes that it doesnt have a hull. Getting kicked in the groin was less painfull then this ending was. Let me just let you know how you should go about watching this anime ",959,158,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kirarin revolution started out as a good show. The animation was good and the storyline was well thought out and nice but after awhile the animation starts to down grade.

This sweet little story takes place early in the show and it's nice to go back and be reminded of the beginnings of Naruto (as I just finished the show). The story itself isn't anything major but I think that's part of why I enjoyed it so much as Naruto usually gets himself involved with bigger things and this was a nice change of pace without becoming boring or lame.,967,166,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have to say I was a little disappointed by Vampire Princess Miyu. It was one of the first vampire anime I watched and although the first few episodes intrigued me most of the plot bored me to sleep (on one occasion literally). Although I loved the characters of Miyu and Larva the plot seemed to consist of defeating the villain-of-the-week and not much else.,973,172,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just some quick thoughts since I didn't finish the anime. The idea of the anime was cute and I actually really like voice-acting and an actual story about it was great and because of the story I really really wanted to watch it. The problem and reason why I dropped it? The characters were extremely irritating and none of them seem likeable for me. I really did try to watch more but I just couldn't stand them. To be honest I tried to watch this anime twice. Both of times for the same reasons. I tried to watch it a second time hoping I grew out of my dislike for the characters... still didn't change sadly. I just can't watch an anime where all the characters irk me. They irritated me because they all seemed one-dimensional and even within the few episodes I watched there was no change. They are so stagnant and had very typical personas of girls that I found lackluster to the entire anime. Recommended to people who probably don't mind these kinds of annoying characters or actually prefer it.,974,173,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai Movie 3: Tsuukaku Zanryuu is definitely better than the first two movies in the series. The animation is superb if retaining the faults of the earlier installations. The sound is solid all around. The plot is a bit shock-value oriented (explicit sexual abuse gore) and is overall quite pedestrian in the landscape of modern anime (it doesn't revel in the brutality yet the violence isn't particularly necessary). That being said the movie is overall an enjoyable experience.,977,176,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai – Tsuukaku Zenryuu (AKA Remaining Sense of Pain) is the third movie in this seinen supernatural mystery series. While I enjoyed the first 2 movies I wasn’t looking forward to this one. I’ve read the original novels by Kinoko Nasu so I know what to expect. The book alone disturbed me and put me off as it made me feel uncomfortable. This chapter of the novel was the most unpleasant of the series due to the subject matter I really don’t do well with rape. Yet it was depicted sensibly here. I happened to start reading the Kara no Kyoukai novels when I was horribly ill and when the first two stories were fine this was too much for my already tormented mind to take thus I stopped reading and had to return when my health got better. As I’ve mentioned before this is set in the Type-Moon universe. I recommend readers refer to my reviews of previous movies for more info on certain things like sound and animation.,979,178,2019-04-13 21:35:40

What I initially thought would be an Ender's Game porno turned out to be a ridiculous eighties action story with healthy doses of blood cars and pedophilia to appeal to every possible demographic.

This is my first review so sorry if its not amazing. But I have to say Magi: The Kingdom of Magic is amazing! I think its better then the original Magi which is strange since most of the time a animes first season or part is usally better then the next. Its great to look at the music in it is amazing and the story it self is unique and great. The only thing I can say bad about it was that I wish it was longer! But regardless its great and you will regret not watching it.,985,184,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Unbelievably this season is more epic then the first. The characters grow and reach their peak of strength and innner self. They experience adventures more challenging and wondurous then the first. This season is alos even more serious then the first as the main characters are faced with a grave challenge and threat to the survival of the world itself. New characters are interestroududed while some old characers get a spotlight and others are pushed into the background of this show. some mysteries and questions are answered while new ones are introduced. It ending is satisfing but has room for clean up. Some things are still unaswered but also highly hint off that there will be a season to look forawrd too. The epic tale is obviously just in its prime and no where near a permanent end. ,991,190,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay here's the thing. You have to go into this anime realizing that it was a show designed for Japanese children. It isn't meant to be super scary (although it does have its moments). I personally enjoyed this anime because it does give you a good bit of insight into Japanese folk tales. The art is mediocre but follows a similiar style to many other children's anime. ,1008,207,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's been ages since I saw the original Evangelion series but when I did watch it (both the American and Japanese versions) I enjoyed it even though it was a little too abstract for me leaving plot holes where I wish things had been more concrete.  The new Evangelion rebuilds do a wonderful job of resolving that slight issue I had with the original show.,1015,214,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's kinda sad. I loved the first season it was everything good about Zero no Tsukaima slapped into another series what's not to like? But this one...is not good. At all. To me it seems like the writers took all of the filler episode rejects from the last season and smashed them all together. It's not that it is necessarily bad it is just really really boring. The animation and sound are as usual well above average but it's just not enough this time. Plus the characters' personalities have become somewhat annoying and flat by this point which doesn't help this season in the slightest. By episode 8 it becomes hard to get motivated to watch the next episode. By 10 it's hard to even sit through the entire episode. There's no excuse for this mess. The writers should be ashamed.,1020,219,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well the first series was pretty damn good. Then I watched the second series and I've got to say. I really liked it a lot. The pacing of the plot moved a lot more fluently than the first season and the characters and animation are still magnificent. ,1021,220,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Strike Witches is an interesting franchise to say the least. Although most American audiences are only familiar with the Anime in Japan it was preceded by a series of light novels art albums and 2 manga story arcs (not to mention the obsequious doujins of course).,1022,221,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1023,222,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Akatsuki no Yona is definetely above average in every respect. The story is captivating the characters are all well-developed animation and sound are really good. But as it is only the first season the ending is incomplete many strings are left dangling and lots of things remain without explanation. And I find that extremely annoying.,1024,223,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Based on 6 episodes.,1025,224,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the best anime I've ever watched! I love characters developments and story. I think that the best part of this anime is that we don't know how is anime going to end because we don't know is 'bad guy' really bad or he's got some very good reasons for doing things the way he does. And that is what makes this anime so intense because we don't know who is going to make it till the end. There are lot of space for new situations and character stories so I hope there will be more chapters :),1026,225,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Entertaining and enjoyable ... with a few plot holes.,1027,226,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,1028,227,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1029,228,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A VERY highly underated new anime. I absolutely adore the relationship/playful fighting between Yona/Hak. Even considered a 'harem' anime it stands on its own with a strong enough plot to keep you seriously interested. Currently my favorite series and can't wait to see more!,1030,229,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First off it's 2 am so this will be a very short review and perhaps not worded the best.,1031,230,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i watched the hole way through i liked it. it had some funny things. and if you watch the whole way thourgh you all might like it 2 beacuse i know i did so you all need to give the whole season a try :D ,1032,231,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story is AMAZING but i was let down when they finaly reach there goal and then the animated version ended. Im reading the rest of the manga but really would have liked the whole thing to be animated. But over all I really loved this anime it have a nice plot and the classic Reverse Harem element (Shoujo and Harem). The Characters are all unique and I love all of them. Animation is beautiful and I recomend it. 10 out of 10 would watch again.,1033,232,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Dropped this one after watching a few times. Usually i do not like anime where is one girl and a sausage fest around her. the best would be 60/40 girl/boy ratiobut here is one girl and the rest of the characters are guys. so that means to like anime like this you must be either a girl or gay.,1034,233,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay fisrt off.... I'm a huge fantasy fan! Lord of the rings Game of thrones love that shizz!! So I always check out anime/manga that have a  medieval kind of feel. ,1035,234,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Absolutely love this show! It's very typical of a reverse harem/historical anime but I love how the main character actually grows in this show.  I was a bit confused by the slow progression (I mean c'mon the fourth dragon doesn't show up until the last episode!) but when I did some digging I found out the manga has at least 90 chapters so sometime within the next year there may be a second series and I'm already stoked.  Beautiful animation as well! Historically though I can't tell whether this is supposed to take place in Japan or China because of the mixed culture but I think it can be interpreted as a fantasy world.  Overall the story is very slow with progression the characters are awesome the lead female is kickass! and I'm so glad I stumbled across it! I highly recommend it! =^_^=,1036,235,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Akatsuki No Yona or Yona of the Dawn is about a sheltered princess and her childhood friends who live in the palace. Her kingdom is peaceful under the rule of her father...Or so she thinks. In actuality her kingdom is suffering greatly which results in her cousin killing her father to take over the throne! (WAAAH?!) While noticing a disturbing presence following her she ends up in her fathers room only to find him dead and her cousin at the crime scene covered in blood. He tells her that he was the one who murdered him (Please take into consideration that Yona is in love with her cousin) which causes a painful and shocking reality to sink in... That she is next on his murder list! Fortunately she was saved by her friend that she grew up with named Hak. Together they escape the palace and fake their murders to continue living. This is the start of a even greater adventure that is in store for Yona.,1037,236,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1038,237,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I heard about this anime few months ago but I was avoiding it. Three weeks ago I finally gave it a go and I'm so glad I did. I absolutely love it. At first I was avoiding it because it didn't sound interesting...one girl with males on journey. But story is great characters are amazing and Yona's developments is great. I'm also looking forward to see her fall in love with Hak who loves her and understands her more than anyone. ,1039,238,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a good anime to watch if you are looking for some cute romance that is not realised by the main character. This can be resembled to maybe  Kaichou wa maid sama . I don't know about you but I think it is sort of frustrating but cute and also since the series didn't really seem to come to a full finish so there could be a second season where maybe this love could hopefully be realised and send us all to happy tears.,1040,239,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime!!!!!! I love it so much I've been watching anime since I was 6 years old and this is a great anime for 6 years and this one of the best anime's in its catagorie.  The plot is pretty good although these types of anime's do appeal to certain audiences.  I love reverse harem anime's ( don't really like harem though) and have watched a lot of them and this anime is definitely up there.  The graphics are pretty well done to I love the 90s anime's but these graphics are definitely better.  Its definitely for a female demographic but it isn't something you can't stand watching with your sister like kimi no tokode.  The voice acting is very well done and not annoying like some voice actors are.  My only complaint is that Zeno introduction was very rushed it was also quite rushed in the manga but you at least got a full chapter on Zeno.  Over all I love this anime and hope it gets renewed but if not I will have no problems watching it again.,1041,240,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This has turned into one of my favorites ever hand in hand with the Fullmetal Alchemists for as different as they may be. I love the animation; it is absolutely beautiful and well done. The story is amazing and well planned and the characters are incredibly well developed. They evolve in a very real and amazing way!,1042,241,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,1043,242,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,1044,243,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After watching the first and second seasons of Dog Days I had high hopes for this season. Overall it was pretty good but it didn't really top the first season. I understand that the producers and writers are trying to leave space at the end for more seasons but I felt like some conflict was left unfinished or resolved in an awkard way. ,1045,244,2019-04-13 21:35:40
in my opinion this is a good recap of season 2,1046,245,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be honest I am a Yaoi fan and this met all the requirements I have for anime and Yaoi.  I can't wait to watch it again!,1047,246,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ep 1: So far I am loving it. After watching Junjou Romantica which is in the exact same vein as Sekai-Ichi Hatsukoi I couldn't resist. Although I can predict the probable main plot already no one really watches yaoi for the plot do they? The story opens with Onodera Ritsu starting a new job at a new publishing company but is assigned to the shoujo manga department much to his distaste. Everyone in the department seems to be zombie-like in their exhaustion except for Takano the head editor of the shoujo manga editing department. There is the obligatory kiss to remind the fangirls that it is in fact yaoi. The next day everyone in the department seems to have been brought back to life with extra pink and the department has been turned into something akin to a seven year old girl's bedroom. About half way through Takano asks Onodera if he knows him from somewhere.  I predict a very awkward scene very shortly along the lines of  Oh sh*t I just remembered! We had sex on the day you confessed to me!   Oh SH*T! . Only it will probably contain less  Oh sh*t  and more blushing more perfect hair and more apologising.,1048,247,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really loved Junjou Romantica (even if the second season is less better than the first) but sekai-ichi Hatsukoi is way better!!! In JR Misaki is a bit annoying sometimes because he's way too defensive. What I like about Onodera is that he's just totally messed up and he's the one who has a bad personnality. Takano is super appealing and got just the right amount of swag (he's perfect!).,1049,248,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The numbers don't work right?,1050,249,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sekaiichi hatsukoi was my introduction to the BL genre seeing as I am a huge BL fan now I know hatsukoi must of done something right. In this review I will mainly be covering the main couple but will touch on the other character at the end of the review. This review is also very opinion based and may be bias just a heads up. This is also my first review every so some feedback is welcome! ,1051,250,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this showwww! It is so good man...the back and forth between stories and the dialogue was just everything. Even when I worried it would get cheesy it didn't. It's BL which I love and its very romantic. My favorite storyline is Takano and Onodera though all three are good. I just can't wait to watch part 2. This show is super addictive and pretty much a giant ball of fluff. It reminded me a little of a fanfiction the way it plays everything out but don't take my word for it just watch it.,1052,251,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show must be my favorite anime i've watched.  As i watched it i went through all kinds of emotions from being sad to happy and angry.  This show gave me butterflies in my tummy.  Its cute even though it BL which i do not mind.  I recommend it!,1053,252,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So I just watched the anime Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi or World's Greatest First Love. To me it was great yaoi after watching Junjou Romantica. It was fun seeing those character hinted and brought up at parts of this animes plot.  I LOVED the pairings they were really cute and of course my favorite was Masamune and Rittsu ♥ Masamune was beyond my favorite character his eyes of course being my favorite thing atop his personality.And over all it ended quite decently without anything being left off or completely in need of a 3rd season. Def. A good anime too watch if you enjoy Boy X Boy and great artwork~ Ill probably read the manga to this too sooner or later well off to the next anime x3,1055,253,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutly LOVE this Anime! I am a very huge fan of Yaoi and this one is a MUST SEE for all Yaoi lovers. Its super adorable and is VERY funny. I love how each main character has their own story and conflict. You get very attached to the characters and you always want to know what is going to happen next. Its super romantic and makes you have a ton of feelings. You definitely will not be disappointed watching this. ^_^b,1056,254,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This has to be the strangest anime i've seen but honestly I really like it! The animation drew me in because of how strange it is at times but the characters won me over and its just an adorable anime with tons of cute little fluffy moments for a shonen-ai fan or someone who loves a cute mermaid story,1066,262,2019-04-13 21:35:40
 This was a very sweet and very cute story. It packed a lot in for its short run time and it actually made me feel emotions. The art style was very unique and otherworldly i really enjoy it they did a fantastic job with what they had. I would recommend it to anyone who loves sweet emotional stories. ,1067,263,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well this is just a compact version of clannad season 1 and 2 but in the end Nagisa didn't come back unlike season2. I thought this will be a new story. And the animes are not as good as they are in series. I liked series more than this movie.,1082,276,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Clannad revolves around Okazaki Tomoya a high-school student who's life is a tedious hell with an alcoholic father that neglected him totally after the death of his mother when he was young. When he thinks his life will move on as if he was a lab rat living day-in and day-out he meets the lovely Nagisa who changes him forever...,1083,277,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,1084,278,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have always been a fan of Clannad the Visual Novel.  Watching this movie really shows the most popular arch that most players tend to go to and did a really good job portraying it to the viewers.  The last scene of the movie is what really reminds me of why I love Clannad so much and how the message of being with family is constantly reminded throughout the entirety of the film and what would happen if you disconnect yourself from others.  It is one to send tears down even my eyes from the beauty of this story and I hope it is the same with the rest of you.,1085,279,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,1086,280,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What about it?,1087,281,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If I could rate it 0 stars I would. This movie is a piece of crap compared to the anime. Enough said.,1088,282,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The Clannad Movie a drama with some comedy romance and something else. I wasn’t originally intending on watching it since I thought it was just a lazy cut-down recap of the anime which I’ve only watched the original first season of. I was wrong this movie seems to be something else entirely built new from the ground up with a slightly different cast of characters and story. I will note that a lot of the criticism of this movie stems from the kinda unrelated (made by a different studio) main anime series. Especially as this movie has its differences and leaves certain things out. Unlike others I will give this movie a fair review I’ll look at it on its own as a movie ignoring the anime series. But I might refer to small changes here and there. I’m a fan of serious to-the-heart stories and this is no different. Should you watch it? Forget this review just watch it. Unless you’re young or cynical and don’t appreciate a serious and beautiful story. In which case this movie doesn’t need your cold hate.,1089,283,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For a video review check out my Youtube channel. Link on my profile page.,1090,284,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I did not like this movie at all. I have seen the show and I love it but this movie was awfull. I could not connect with the characters at all and I didn't feel any emotion while watching this except annoyance. The music was good and it was the same music that is in the show. The voice actors did a good job as well. The story did not make a lot of sense. If I had not seen the show before hand I think that I would have been utterly lost. The characters were off the story was disjointed and confusing. It time jumped a lot as well. Overall I would not reccomend this movie.  ,1091,285,2019-04-13 21:35:40
You can either have the feels in 90min or in 23 episodes your choice. Yes this is mostly a summary of the series but I still enjoyed it but for those who haven't seen the series this may be a good introduction if you are unsure of commiting for 23 episodes but you will get spoilers .,1092,286,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Let me give you a very short and simple review.,1095,289,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As a total this anime is still watchable but not really enjoyable. There are plots everywhere instead this could have remain as simple storyline. The Red Dragon has gone mad but wherever is the reason it shouldn't be manipulate by humans even as royal family members. The Expedition could have continue and just battles scenes sacrifice someone to save another would be enough for this anime.,1096,290,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I can't remember how old was I when I watched this but let me just say: That 'little-me' back then loved this. It's funny action packed and you get to see what most of the Z warriors were like as kids...no need to mention what Goku was like; he's the same as ever. Nostalgia right here.  ,1097,291,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Really I can't even remember how long ago it was that I first saw Dragon Ball.  But probably like any young boy it instantly captured me in its amazing display of martial arts powers and awesome action.  Well the years have gone by since I first saw that wonderous series of my youth and in that time I have seen things that have far surpassed that series I saw so long ago.  The graphics still look like how I remember though when compared to some of newer things that have come out within the past decade the show tends to look a lot less attractive but that'ss what happens as things age.  The fighting is still the same as what I remember though when you hear the characters saying their attacks it does tend make me think as to why I ever liked the show.  Looking back now the I also fail to see why I ever thought this show was funny when thinking about the lame jokes.  But these are all still small complaints especially when considering the fact that this series really did influence a younger population of the world.  So assuming things like outdated graphics and characters yelling their attacks don't bother you then this series may just be something that you're looking for.,1103,297,2019-04-13 21:35:40
An anime I thoroughly enjoyed as a kid and now I have to come to appreciate it once again. Re-watching this thrilling action packed adventure reminds me of why I do martial arts.,1104,298,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really like dragonball I always did even when I was a little kid. The advanters that the characters had wher really funny and just fun. Im Italian so when I was a kid I use to watch it in Italian. It is so much better then english. Not wanting to hate on the original Japanes one but I think its even better then that version. The voices are funnier the songs are better and just over all its better. Some small things that I didnt like where wll I dont know but really small things cause over all Dragonball is a extremlly good serie for all ages.,1107,301,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Dragonball follows the character we all know Goku at a young age. I say if you loved Dragonball Z then you love watching Goku's history and reveal just some of those questions you may of asked during Z.Its cute funny and very Akira Toryfied what an excellent franchise. ,1108,302,2019-04-13 21:35:40

this anime will bring you to the world that we all love.. food and showed us how this talented boy cooking so passion with a lilttle sassy move and make us to enjoy the story more . with the main character that so funny and literally so motivated. no doubt this anime was the best ever in past 1997.,1123,316,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overall I think that this was a good anime. It had a good story line for the most part of the anime except for the last episode was a little wierd. The anime had a good animation to it. The characters and the scenary were well desined and most had alot of fine details to them. The music in the anime was good in my opinion. Some of the voices for some of the characters in my opinion did not fit the desing of that character and either the voice was to high pitched or to low pitched. For the most part I liked some of the characters like some of the main characters but some of the secondary and minor characters really ticked me off and I felt like they do not really belong.,1132,323,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1133,324,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the few endings to an anime I have ever liked. All was wrapped up nicely and still leaving the big question up for interpretation.,1135,325,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was highly interesting and the characters were unique and diverse in personality. In Akuma no riddle 12 students are tasked with assasinating Haruichi Ichinose a charismatic and innocent young girl who finds herself accompanied with a series of peculiar circumstances. The story focus' on Haru and the relationship she forms with Tokaku Azuma as she tries to protect Haru defecting from her original mission. In all the plot is quite interesting and the animation used is very fitting for this anime. The thing about it is though you either like it or you don't. Many people may find Haru's optimistic nature agitating and thus not enjoy the anime as much as others. What was likeable about Akuma no riddle was that though all of the students were tasked with assasinating Miss Ichinose none attempted to do so in quite the same way so there was a fair amount of variation. Also i felt like it was worth mentioning that the shows themesong was pretty cool and related nicely to the show.,1136,326,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Its a bittersweet show about how oppisites attract. Being that the story was a bit confusing at times But the best part of this anime was that emotion of domination after one of the antagonist dies* thats just my opinion* Also this was my first anime i ever watched ,1143,333,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A perfect horror/romance anime very unique and i havent seen an anime like this so i really liked it <3,1144,334,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show I watched when i was 9 I rewatched it recently and I question myself. How did I enjoy it? I understand I was a fucked up kid but there was hardly any character development. They spent too much time on Yuno and no other characters. Though this was the first anime I watch cause I felt like it I wouldn't put it in my top 5. If anything it would be a 8/9 in my top ten. Honestly the show is enjoyable & watchable but if they had more character development and stopped thinking about Yuno 24/7 it would've been so much easier too watch. Also the rape scene and all the other dirty things weren't needed. For me atleast.,1145,335,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I think the general idea of this ova is amazing. It has the same type of feel to it as death note and code geass. (kinda). I mean if you know the future from your cell phone there is experiments to be done to figure out how it all works... like if it changes depending on what you do or there is no way to change the future? interesting people do different things and who are the admins? some artificial intellegence or something like a god from another dimention or what?,1146,336,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had some hope for this one when I first saw it because it was trying to be visually a little different with thick lines that give the show a wood-block quality and ink splatters. But beyond that it is pretty conventional and also just downright dull.,1150,340,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This story seem a little interesting but the blood effects are so annoying. This is about 2 girls who were runaways from another territory and the student counsil tries to catch them. the dude found them inside his dojo and was attacked by them. he defeats them within seconds and the story starts there. but seriously the blood affects are annoying. they use it as a censor but sometimes they splat blood just for the hell of it. thats how i feel.,1154,344,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well let me just say this. I'm a huge fans of Ikeyamada Go's manga and I was really excited when I heard that  Suki desu Suzuki-kun  was made in to an OVA but I was disapointed with the animation and sound. I believe that this could have been an amazing anime if the animation and soundtrack were better but on the other hand I have always wanted to see a work of Go Sensei animated so I can't help but give it a high score. It's maybe because she's my favorite mangaka but if I wasn't her fan beforehand I definitely wouldn't have given this OVA a high score.,1164,354,2019-04-13 21:35:40

El Cazador de la Bruja (Witch Hunter in Spanish or more perfectly translated as The Hunter of the Witch) is a beautiful story of companionship between two main characters Ellis and Nadia.  The story follows Ellis in mexico as a bounty is placed on her head over mysterious reasons concerning an american project named 'Leviathan.'  The study was over unlocking lost genetic coding that enables humans to use 'Witches' powers.  They attempted to bring back to these powers in geneticly engineered children all of which turned into failures... accept 1 Ellis.  She was being researched by a doctor and one thing lead to another she ended up getting away and escaping to mexico.  How this happens no idea.   It's the only plot hole I found besides the untold story of the little girl who hangs with Ricardo.,1166,356,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At first I thought that this wouldn't be too good of an anime since it isn't very popular but after watching the whole series I was shocked. Despite it only being 11 episodes long it has a lot of character depth and has a plot that we've all heard of in one form or another in an amazing way. Each episode had me constantly wondering about what was going to happen and on many occasions I found myself screaming at the characters to do what I wanted them do (which never works but don't kill me for trying). It isn't the type of anime that ends with a million questions or you wanting there to be a second season because a lot of loose ends are tied up and even though I did ask myself some questions at the end the manga answers them as well (read it!). Lastly watch the anime and tell others to as well if you like it because more people need to know about the wonderful anime that is Jyu Oh Sei!,1188,377,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"So many animes feel like they are either too long or too short for their story. This is a prime example. It seemed like they planned the show to be longer but it was cut short. 11 episodes? That seems like a weird number to stop on. At least 12 or 13 would be normal. Series usually have a beginning middle and an end. Not Jyu Oh Sei. It felt like it jumped from the introduction episodes (where characters are introduced) and then suddenly it was at the climax. In the middle of the show it jumped about five years. It could have been been a 20-something episode show if it showed what happened in those years. I would have liked that so it could show more character development instead of jumping completely to the developed character. ",1190,379,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This one was a surprise enjoyment. The Summery of it makes it seemather dull. But the character development and interaction with onenother was pretty darn good. It even managed to surprise me a littles well. Which is a HUGE accomplishment because I almost always  see itoming  None of the characters really annoyed me so that was anotherccomplishment for this anime as well. Tiz was a little annoying but Iould see why she was being whiny so it wasn't all that bad.,1193,382,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I had extremely high hopes for Juuousei after the first couple ofpisodes.

When I watched the first episode I wasn`t sure how good this anime was going to be but I figured it couldn`t hurt to give it a chance.  As I watched it some of the art just seemed a bit strange such as the nose length seemed a bit disproportionate to the character`s face.  Otherwise than that I found the story to be interesting and it kept my interest throughout.  I found it to be a short series but for the length it was it seemed fine.,1195,384,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I never go into watching specials expecting much. I was not expecting the pure ecchi-fest that were these specials--why I didn't I have no clue considering the ecchiness of the series. But the series maintained a certain amount of decency while this does not. Now I'm not opposed to ecchi though I often find it takes away from the seriousness of a story (a reason why I'm glad the series stayed most decent especially during Amane's backstory). However I still think that pointless stand-alone ecchi is just that: pointless. Maybe I care too much about story and substance but I just don't see the point of these. ,1202,389,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Its not only a good play toy for kids but their amazing real close up on the show and they look so fun on the game I have of this for ps2.

This anime was very good I am impressed but the story could have been made a little better. The anime did have a lot of twists and turns and thats what made really nice and entertaining to watch. I think that the females could have had a bigger role in the sotry. The part that really ticked me off was how everyone thought that the antagonist was presumed to be male and it turns out that it is a female. Like that is completely unrealistic and pathetic. How can a male just sudenly take off a simple mask and turn back into a female. That is totally bullshit. I think that the director the producer and the enitire cast of Bakugan Battle Brawlers was high or either drunk when they came up with this idea. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody except for kids that are 10 years old because they are the only ones who wouldn't think that the part where a male turns into a female is stupid. I think that by this all the females in the anime was humiliated and insulted. Never in my life have I ever seen this happen.,1211,398,2019-04-13 21:35:40

To this day this anime is and probably forever will be my favorite because it's the kind of series that hooks you in and doesn't let you go. The animation is great and the English voice actors weren't that bad either. The series centers around a boy who discovers a notebook that can kill people. He's a little hesitant at first and doesn't believe it but once he tries it and finds out that it works he continues to kill more and more people undetected until the Police figure out it's a serial killer. I think Kira is a genius the way he was able to actually be in the same building as the people who were trying to hunt him down. All that time he manipulated everyone into believing he was the good guy who wanted Kira caught just as much as the police did. Unfortunately he let the Death Note consume him as he made foolish mistakes and not only killed criminals but starting killing everyone who got in his way. I highly recommend this anime to everyone even if your not a big anime fan since before I even started watching this anime I couldn't stand any anime at all. Thanks to this show I can consider myself a pretty big anime fan now.,1218,404,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death note has long been my favorite anime and one of my favorite stories ever told through any media. While I almost dislike how popular it has become it doesn't take away from the genuine genius of the story. I will admit when i first saw the description of the show It did not grab me but 1 episode in and I had fallen in love. The writing is brilliant the characters are unforgettable (at least Light and L are) but what will stick with you is the music. I have never in my life heard such an amazing soundtrack both in how fitting it is to the show and how good it is on its own. The show closely follows the manga but even if you've read it I recommend the show purely for the element of the music. Just because fanboys ruin something great doesn't mean it's actually that bad. If you haven't seen it give it 3 episodes. NOTE: I have watched both the dub and sub versions and I truly think the dub of this show is superior. Ryuk's voice in English is one of the best voice acting jobs I've ever heard. ,1219,405,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the most entertaining series of all time watching L battle it out with light and seeing how all that happens inter links the problem I have with the series is when L isn't anymore as the two successors were awful characters with no development it about this time when the series started to decline I did like the way they ended it though it rounded it off quite well and considering how it all started out its not the end I could of predicted as it turned out better then I though it could have.,1220,406,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It is a bit like the ultimate battle between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarti but you may have a hard time telling who the good guy or bad guy is.  After a while you might lean away from the main character mainly because he seems to loose focus on who exactly deserves his form of retribution but unlike other animes (such as Lelouch of Code Gaess) with similar dispicable characters you love to hate but hate what you love about them at the same time you expect it from his character.  Yet you do not expect it absolutely because he wavers on some of his heaviest descisions about what the right choice is until he eventually learns to or perhaps as a character develops no need to hesitate or doubt about the direction of the path he has chosen.  There are a few interesting characters interceding along the way and at times you can see the conflict of what is right or wrong painted on their faces as well.  By the end though viewers might feel either at tad confused or let down because not all the characters in the end get what they earned as either rewards or punishments.  This kind of makes you wonder about the morality of the show mainly because one of the people who avoided what other characters got more than what those characters got was the girl who punished people very recklessly and constantly put innocents in harms way.  Sure the focus of the story was cold and calculating but even at his worst he was still much more in control and focused to the point of avoiding far more reckless endangering situations than his would be partner who he recruits later on.  Perhaps it is because of what happens to her after she loses something of great importance or perhaps it is because animes frequently delve into morally ambigious stories (though a few are so black or white there is no ambiguiaty about the darkness or light side of those stories).  Sure it is fequently a question for all but often in animes they take it to very distant extremes.  However a few stories does a far better job at balancing those extremes or the moral conflict that may occur among the characters relating to the story.  And as usual there are a few glaring misses or a couple mistakes.  Such as I can not help but wonder  what if he wrote that he died but came back to life immortal?  It is not a big hole but there are ways around some of the shall we say negatives with having one of those books.  ,1221,407,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Death Note is what first got me into anime and I am so glad I googled it because it is probably one of my favourite shows ever. Its a great starter anime the animation is brilliant so are the characters. It was great to look forward to watching another episode as soon as I got home every day. Bloody good ending too. Didn't think much to the live action remake but what can you do. I loved the relationships between the characters and the characters in general.

I personally think this is one of the best animes I have ever watched and I have watched it more then once and acually own some of the mangas. If you can not handle cruel or disturbing thoughts then Deathnote isn't for you. It makes you think from a teen ridden with power and no control while is genius clashes with  L  (my personal favorite character). Its has some really aweomse animation and sounds including its soundtrack. And anyone who has watched it can tell you that is a wonder Thriller you'll always be guessing. It kinda sucks when it ends but you understand why it had to end cause really nothing more could be included. I havn't seen the movies but I would love to!,1240,425,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1241,426,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,1243,427,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a brilliant show but it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. If you're looking for a happy ending or even one that has somewhat of an upbeat ending you will not find it here. I don't see how this show could have had an happy ending. The main character has good intentions but the way he goes about things is just wrong and so you can't help but cheer for him while wishing that he will be taken down. There is just no way to get a happy ending with something like that.,1244,428,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1245,429,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,1246,430,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death note is my favorite anime to begin with there is no doubt about it. But why is it my favorite? The characters are all well thought out the plot makes you guessing each time if you have not seen it as many times as I have (which has become so much that I can watch it in the Japanese without the subtitles and still know what is going on). The mind blowing epicness of this thriller is so intense that if you are not strong enough to take it you better not just think about watching a few episodes. YOU MUST WATCH IT ALL! And not to be a spoiler but when it comes to a certain point in the anime do not stop halfway through because you are angry or sad or upset. Continue and see what happens anyways. You must see it to believe it!,1247,431,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,1248,432,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime has a very sinister vibe to it and i absolutly loved it! The way that they show Light and go into his very train of thought and how he thinks about every act he makes and the actions he himself and the public will react to his actions are complatly amazing! ,1249,433,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There are anime that are easy and fun to watch and then there are anime that are deep and profound. Death note is the hands down best of the former type.,1250,434,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the anime i watched the fastest. I don't even saw the 37 episodes going. It seems to take one huge episode. As today it still one of the greatest anime i have watched. Great story of cat and mouse. The characters were well made and fun to watch.,1251,435,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story,1252,436,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Enter the mind of a sociopath Light Yagami. A remarkable teenager he's devilishly handsome twice junior tennis champion and ranks first in the national exams. In other ways though he's quite the simpleton: a textbook megalomaniac with delusions of grandeur. Oh and he's just been handed the power to kill individuals simply by writing their names in a notebook.,1253,437,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I know many people compare Death Note to Code Geass and vice versa and the two series are very similar but both with their own distinct style and tone.  Death Note's very dark tone throughout combined with a truly evil main character truly separates it from Code Geass.  By that I don't mean that one is better than the other I mean that they are the best in their own respective genres.  On the topic of an evil main character (or at least I think he's evil) the most entertaining aspect of this series is the battle of wits that ensues throughout this anime's entirety (SPOILER: Though one of my favorite moments in this series is when Light and L start beating the crap out of each other).  While I was initially thinking that there is no way people this immensely intelligent actually exist I found myself later in the series thinking  WHO CARES THIS IS AWESOME!   Even the story has its own unique style to it as it is not a story of character development and learning life lessons and all that fun stuff but one of somewhat of an epic tale or war story for lack of a better term  Anyway if you want a truly amazing anime with great characters epic story and otherwise a total break from the anime stereotype Death Note is the show for you.,1254,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Although i proudly name myself after Misa Amane and i love this anime/manga...i have to say that it really ticked me off towards the end. the story was waaaaaaaaaay different than any other manga appearing to be more like an american thriller novel than a japanese manga...i will always love this anime/manga but there are some things that cannot be forgiven becuase of certain scenes. overall it was an outstanding manga/anime,1255,439,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1256,440,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It’s so hard to say anything bad about this anime yet every time I think about I rage a little on the inside. Overall the series is amazing. It’s extremely captivating from the very beginning and you immediately want to jump to the last episode but trust me it’s worth watching all 37 episodes.,1257,441,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,1258,442,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death note.. It's amazing. I like the shinigamis and the characters. The plot was a little confusing but after a while it cleared up. In my opinion I think it would've been better with a little less Kira's but I understand that it had to be like that to move foward with the plot. All in all it was a good anime but not an anime for beginners. (If you're just starting anime don't watch as your first!),1259,443,2019-04-13 21:35:40
 I absolutly LOVED Death Note what I loved about this series was that everything felt like it actually happened! The characters story line and just everything else felt real! Plus they put in plot twists that were so..... surprising. If you do watch this series just beware of it's dark and surprising plot twists and some parts that just might make you cry.,1260,444,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,1261,445,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Storyline:,1262,446,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As much as I want to dislike Death Note I can't. It's like sugar - once you've tasted it you can't help but want it a lot. I don't think I know a single anime-loving person who hasn't seen Death Note. It's kind of become required watching. It's exciting fast-paced and tricky with incredibly interesting characters and about a million plot twists. Who doesn't love L the cake-loving super genius detective? Who doesn't (at least secretly) love Light Yagami the psychopathic sociopath serial killer with a god complex? Who doesn't love Matsuda a complete idiot and the butt of practically every joke? Who doesn't love (or really really hate) Misa the very annoying borderline-loli girlfriend of Light?,1263,447,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,1264,448,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Plot of Death Note is amazing but sometimes it might make you think that the writer just  tries to prove he is smart . Animation is almost flawless. Negative element is that it is longer than it should but you can't just drop it.,1265,449,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After having watched Death Note I haven't felt this ambivalent since playing Mass Effect. That's what I felt throughout the anime though I was always feeling ambivalent towards everything and everyone. I always had 2 contradicting feelings. Now I am no fanboy of Death Note nor am I a 'hater'. You could say I am both (wow again it's as if I'm almost doing this on purpose). I have come a little late to the party but nevertheless I intend to give my opinion on this anime. This will most likely be the only review I write. So bear with my amateurish style and non-conventional review (is it bad that I'm on the defense already?).,1266,450,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,1267,451,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,1268,452,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death note Not a bad anime. It was pretty good. I skipped most of the story But only because it was a bunch of nothing. But it was good. And it SHOULD of lasted longer. I didnt like the Real-Life Movies though because Half of the story was diffrent then the Anime itself. It was a great story,1269,453,2019-04-13 21:35:40

TIME FOR A CLASSIC:,1271,455,2019-04-13 21:35:40
                           First off MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ANIME!! Seriously I greatly enjoyed this anime. I believe that the plot was excellent. I mean the high schooler with a sense of what's going on and in the world all over and not just his own life. L the world's *cutest* smartest dectective Misa the bubbly goth. I loved it.The story is a little slow at first but around episode 4-6 it picks up and it stays at a nice pace. Not too slow and not too fast. The plot is genius I mean it doesn't give everything away in the beginning. You learn a little more about each character with each episode. Not to mention the music's quite awesome. I have the majority of the themes on my mp3 player and I'll listen to them quite often. While L's themes makes me feel smarter Matt's theme just makes me feel badass. And the Death Note theme makes me feel epic! And the openings/ endings were nicley animated. I especially loved the first opening The World by Nightmare just describes the series perfectly. Whereas I saw What's Up People? as more of a humorous thing. And the characters were nicely developed each about with their own personality and style. Just simply amazing. But the anime taught me a little moralality (and nutrition :P) and 'if you had that power how would you use it?' Overall I don't really see a good-guy or a bad-guy. Everbody had their own idea of what's right and I agreed with both sides.,1272,456,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,1273,457,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I admit I'm completely obsessed with anti-heroes.  Light Yagami is  perfect  all around in the eyes of the people around him but has a dark shadow in his soul.  He had good intentions but the power to kill can bend the hearts of all those who use it and it certainly bent his.,1274,458,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death Note... ah yes Death Note Death Note Death Note... this series is a masterpiece and I'm going to state my opinions on it I'm going to state  my  opinion not the  facts  because with anime there is no fact whether it is good or not it is up to the viewer.,1275,459,2019-04-13 21:35:40

What can I say about Deathnote... It is a must watch. The story and the characters L and Light are the best. I didnt like mello so much though. I also didnt like the colour scheme because at times it was too dark. The story is fantastic amazing EPIC.,1278,462,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's difficult to have an interest in anime and have not at least hear about Death Note.  It's one of the most popular animes out there and for good reason.,1283,466,2019-04-13 21:35:40
DEATH NOTE is amazing perhaps the most clever and well written story in anime of all time. Within the first episode you will be sucked in by the clever game that both Light Yagami and L play when trying to get one another. Few stories have this much thought and detail put into them everything that happens is important to the story providing a story that is unlike any anime that has ever been created. This is a must see anime that you just have to see.,1284,467,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"So I was writing a perfectly awesome review when I accidently reloaded the page and everything disappeard...... Fuck this I'm not writing it again. Just know this anime is great and you should watch it. If you wanna know why I can write a new review in a week or so when my anger goes away. Bye peace. ",1288,471,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death Note gets 9.9/10 because the first season is the most addictive mind twisting psychological rollercoaster any show has ever sent me down. It falls short of a perfect 10 simply because the second season feels lacking compared to the first (trying not to spoil). This is the number one anime I recomend to people who aren't into anime and even those people have loved Death Note. The characters are memorable unique and best of all intelligent. The mental chess game between L and Kira is amazing. If there is one show you must watch this is it.,1289,472,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,1293,475,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death Note has became a very popular anime and is very well known and there is a very good reason why that is. Death Note is a short series but its plot is very well thought out and keeps you at the edge all 37 episodes. The characters are very interasting and have their own points of view. The struggle between L and Light is just outstandingly done and Light is one crazy character. The only reason why I didn't give it 10 is that for me 10 means its perfect but I think nothing is perfect xD. Death Note still remain my favorite anime. I highly Recommand it.,1295,476,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The STORY of Death Note although perhaps not entirely originally is nearly flawlessly portrayed.  We follow Light Yagami who has found a notebook that will kill whoever's name is written there and he must battle in his mind between right and wrong.  It was so fascinating to watch his internal battle and to see him debate what exactly is right and wrong.  I found a lot of Death Note to be very philosophical and I believe that this is the reason it held so many people's interests.,1296,477,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Death Note Review ",1297,478,2019-04-13 21:35:40
You have read the synopsis and are still reading this which means you are not satisfied with the information that was given to you. I must agree I would even say that the synopsis is wrong... of course there is a guy named Light Yagami who finds this magical  Death Note  and he indeed wants to change the world and whatever… but that’s not what it is about! Those are only tools in order to tell the best detective story ever animated (or at least to try). Let me paint the setting for you.,1298,479,2019-04-13 21:35:40
(Synopsis) Light Yagami a brilliant high school student stumbles upon a mysterious book called the  Death Note  dropped by a shinigami named Ryuk. After discovering the power of killing people with a stroke of a pen Light seeks for a better world with no crime. Light is now called  Kira  by the world and also calling himself the God of the new world. After many killings a legendary detective and later Light's intellectual rival L is called in to help catch Light. Through mind games and psychological battles these two will use their minds and intellect to outwit each other in a game of cat and mouse.,1299,480,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death Note is . . . it is something I never expected to see something Ilways wanted to see and so much more in an anime. From the moment it begano the moment it ended I did not move an inch except to light anotherigarette. I mean that literally I was spell-bound for 37 breath-takingpisodes without reprieve.,1300,481,2019-04-13 21:35:40
" Death Note  is the anime adaption based off the Manga of the same name written by Writer Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Manga Artist Takeshi Obata. Since it's release Death Note has become a huge success in both Japan and the West becoming one of most critically acclaimed shows of all time as well as being known as one of the  gateway animes  that have helped ease many newcomers to anime into the demographic. It was one of the first animes I myself had ever watched and as such is rather special to me and I thank it for getting me to watch more and more shows.",1301,482,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Overall I thought that this was a fairly good anime.  It has characters who instead of having these huge battles to get things done or change the world they rely more on their brains to effect change.  The story revolves around a guy named Light Yagami who finds this notebook called a Death Note.  What a Death Note does is that if someone writes down the name of someone with there face in mind that person will die whether it's by how a person describes or by heartattack if nonething is written down.  So Light under the name  kira  uses the Death Note to bring justice to the world by killing criminals.  During the series Light's main opponent is a guy who goes by the name L and so the story for the most part revolves around them with kira killing criminals and L trying to find out who kira is.  This anime is definitly worth a watch because the story can keep u hooked throughout most of the series and the characters are interesting.,1302,483,2019-04-13 21:35:40

We all hate crime happening which is what Death Note follows a young adult called Light Yagami who hates crime and wants rid of it but believes this will never become a reality later to find out he finds purely accidental of course a book called “Death Note” which you can write the name of the person whom you want to kill and it kills them so he uses it to kill them and tries to make his dream become a reality.,1314,488,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Personally I loved this series its full of action and keeps you on your toes constintly. Plus it always has that  what if  question running in the back of your mind throughout the series always making you think. I loved the characters and the voice acting in my opinion was done very well. I really enjoyed the series and even liked the way it ended. Though some of the characters got slightly annoying to me like Misa for example it was still amazing to watch and its one I wouldn't mind re-watching.,1327,493,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime got such high ratings I might be unfairly rating this as I was let down so much by it. The anime is pretty much summed up by  I knew that you would do that so I did this .  Oh yeah well I knew that you'd know so I actually did this .  Turns I knew that you'd know that I knew so I did this ... For about the entire anime.  ,1335,499,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Man oh man...I feel like I need to catch my breath after this one. This has to be in my top 5 of all time...I am angry at myself for waiting so long to finally watch it! Possibly the most intricate and clever anime (and television program period) I've ever seen. The cat and mouse between Light and L was mesmerizing...it was just perfect. Twist after twist had me wondering who was going to come out on top and how one or the other was going to get out of the pickle they were in. The Shinigami characters were brilliant and I even thought the secondary characters (I.e. Misa Near Mikami Mello etc) were well thought out. ,1340,504,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So here it is. The review of the acclaimed Death Note series. Like it or not here it is. Enjoy. Oh and short as ever.,1341,505,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ok Death Note its a milestone all anime-lovers cross at some point. Its like the ritual of becoming an adult. Death Note's overwhelming atmosphere plot story characters and sound are all genius level with only a slight downfall which disappoints many.,1342,506,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story - Death Note is an anime about a boy who finds a black notebook that can kill anyone. Overall this is a fairly good plot. Ive heard of better but its a nice concept. It could have been presented a little better though.,1344,508,2019-04-13 21:35:40
ALERT: SPOILERS (OBVIOUSLY),1345,509,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I did like this anime however I found myself growing bored towards the end. I skipped about eight - ten episodes. I skipped to the end of it as well. The beginning is very good though just the ending feels quite a bit dragged out which is annoying because it is such a good anime! ,1346,510,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Great stoyline brilliant for anime. The death theme is on-point....I love it! If I had the time id watch this series over and over again...Thats how much I love it. Now I know i shoudnt be bais. but ya'll should totally watch it. The main character is a great reflection of twised ideas of justice.,1347,511,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime. And I hate this anime. The quality of animation isint the best cause this anime isin't the newest one. But i liked the characters specially im still live in Light.,1348,512,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of my favorite anime. It's story is so compelling and original. It starts out simple but then explodes into a truly amazing experience. The twists and turns involved in this story are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. What good is a story though if the characters are bad? Fortunately the main characters are all interesting and fleshed out. The animation is also great. It truly is beautiful. The music is also superb from the shows theme songs to background music. But the best thing about this series is the fact that there is no definate good or bad guy. It is all up to the viewer to decide. That alone makes this a unique experience. At the end of the day If your a fan of compelling stories deep characters stunning twists and vivid animation then this is a show for you.,1349,513,2019-04-13 21:35:40
WOW thats all I have to say the characters are amazing storys even better I especially find it interesting how the main character the one your supporting turns out to be the evil one you know you want L is right but you still support Light aswell deepdown because he's the one you follow from the start. I think its really well thought out with twists and turns the mystery that we all know the answer to and the ultimate question its based around the death penalty  it makes you wonder what you would do with such a power. Truely brilliant the characters are so smart and sneaky you never know what will happen they are subtle and the animation is done in such a way you know what they are thinking. BRILLIANCE!,1350,514,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i was very impressed with how well this anime drew me in with suspense. I always wanted more and would binge watch episodes. The story is interesting and the characters are all very mysterious. The battle between Kira and L is always so satisfying to watch as you see them competing against each other's wit. If you like thriller and mystery you will probably like this anime. ,1351,515,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was my first anime that i watched fully through its also what got me hooked on anime! I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot and characters because it would ruin the story! I don't look at animation and sound so i'm not going to rate those anyways this anime has a storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat and is a good anime for you first timers(in watching anime that is)!,1352,516,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,1353,517,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I must say i like this anime very much. If you like psychological anime and horror this is a must watch. I for one started to watch this anime because there was a huge hype about it and i had to see it for myself. I must say i was impressed. The rumors were true in my case but if you do not like this genre i can imagine why you would not watch it. Still for me this was a very good anime and i would certainly rewatch it in the future.,1355,518,2019-04-13 21:35:40
simply the best seinen of all time!,1356,519,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I thing it's one of the best anime of whole time. It have everything and it really looks realistic. I didn't knew how story will end and this anime take me to other world. I couldn't stop watching it. really good anime. For me it's TOP2. I think everyone must watch it.,1357,520,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kinda sucks,1366,529,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first thing i want to say is that i would like to meet whoever wrote this.  This is the #17 ranked show for a reason.  The story was just so well thought out is what it comes down to.  I've read other reviews where people said that they thought it was too slow and stuff like that but every episode pretty much was a cliffhanger that made me want to see what happens next.,1367,530,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story and animations. Enough said. A brilliant watch if you like detective-like anime / TV shows.,1368,531,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death Note was a very good anime to watch. Loved it and enjoyed it very much. It wasn't serious all the time and I liked that about it. I also enjoyed the mystery and suspense that happened throughout the anime. Very very good. ,1369,532,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,1370,533,2019-04-13 21:35:40
An incredibly dark and suspenseful anime series Death Note is a show about brilliant Light Yagami who attempts to rid the world of evil by writing in a notebook he found called Death Note. Many long arguments and conversations are had by the characters with usually very little action per episode. Although this sounds like a slightly boring premise Death Note manages to be one of the most exciting and suspenseful animes I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.,1371,534,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i liked it because there wasnt to much gruesome effects and you had to think most of the ways i didnt like how L managed to know he is for so long and still didnt just jail him and Near just held on to the band wagon then 1 minute later kira is under arrest. i liked it because there wasnt all fighting and the story line and characters were great and the sound was good no problems. it wasnt a perfect 10 but definatley on my top animes (hence the profile pic),1372,535,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,1373,536,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hello all and What am I going to say about this grand old show... Um uh you see um oh yes you can see what i have to say on this nice little video and this is my video I'm just not in th mode to right one out right now,1374,537,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I want to quickly preface this review by saying that I began trying to get myself interested in anime again with Death Note. I grew up watching several anime shows on Toonami and Adult Swim when it started airing them but eventually other interests especially gaming at the time pulled me away. About a year ago I started watching DBZ again and began asking for recommendations of more recent animes. Nearly everyone said Death Note was a good starting place.,1375,538,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death note was the first anime series that i watched and it must have been bloody good because it got me hooked on anime and manga.,1376,539,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I call this anime a thinking anime. Because it can be so much enjoyable if you go along thinking how it's all coming totether and making assumptions to what will happen next. ,1377,540,2019-04-13 21:35:40
ferrrrr fooooooooooooooooooooks seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek laddy. this shite wuz gud. I giv it a solid j0rp's 8/10. I meyd tha fokin misteek of watchin it in english doob. but even then it wuz still good cunt. overall it wuz a good show lads i definitely recommend it 2 u. Now go watch it b5 i fokin bash ye!,1378,541,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Death Note is the single most overrated anime of all times. It is decent don't get me wrong but is it one of the greatest? HELL NO. It is a juvenile story with stupid characters executed well if you happen to be an angsty middle-school boy. Otherwise this is a barely above average waste of time.,1379,542,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The reason Death Note didn't get full marks even though it is one of my favourite animes of all time is the fact that the storyline kind of depleated when *spoiler alert* L dies. The characters were developed quiet well as for the ending though... Light wouldn't of been that easily fooled after being up against the great L (in my personal opinion). The soundtrack is abosolutly brilliant and the animation is great for it's time the art style wasnt particularly to my taste but the storyline kept me coming back for more. Overall still a great anime and still one of my favourites now. ,1380,543,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Everything about this anime- i like! Even the ending did not bother me at all i think it is ok as it happened. But the story!! all the twists and turns and all the mysteries...omg it was so cool!,1381,544,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,1382,545,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I absolutly loved watching this anime along with reading the manga.,1383,546,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"This is really just an amazing anime. For those who have read the manga the anime follows the plot line completely the only difference being in the very ending scene. Death Note contains the complex interesting characters of Light Yagami and  L  and a plot that leaves you wondering whose side you're on. Overall this is simply fantastic--a masterpiece.   ",1384,547,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"The story of the anime is superb it's starts off with a high school student named Light Yagami who is bored with his life and one day when he got of school he found a book titled named Death Note. He picked it up and thought it was stupid but he took the book with him anyway. When he got home he read through the book and thought that the notebook is nothing but fake garbage however he wanted to test it on a bad person meaning he will write down that guy's name in the notebook and he would die. When he saw that guy die in a matter of seconds he realized that the Death Note is real and it could kill anyone he wants. During the show he wants to become the New God of the New World also know as Kira by killing all the bad people only but it's not gonna be easy since there will be some people in his way. ",1389,552,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While I found the anime to be problematic to both players and non of the original visual novel is much more fitted for players. It does some interesting things that are unique for the OVA however the story jumps around so quickly that anyone who hasn't played the game is likely to be majorly confused. ,1390,553,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this is not worth watching it seems to just be a what if story of what could have happened. I really don't recomend it.,1391,554,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well... I haven´t played this game which I think is crucial to understand the story. I have only seen the anime. This OVA is really something for BDSM yaoi fangirls :D. I like some parts some not. Its worth to watch it but only once.,1392,555,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Seson 2 wasn't all that good. Due to the fact Endless Eight literally being 8 episodes that caused everyone watching it to turn into zombies ( I was close to commiting sucide ) and the The Sigh of Haruhi Suzmiya Episodes wer pretty much a drag to me. So pretty much the only episode in Season 2 I give a 10 in Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody. Hopefully Season 3 will become great.,1397,560,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The worst time loop ever to make the fans watch over and over the same shit again is just despicable. A truly shameful act for animators to do that little stunt.,1399,562,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,1400,563,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The writers behind Haruhi are nothing if not bold.  4/7 of this season is the same episode over and over but with different animation camera angles dialogue and all the little details over and over while the SOS Brigade relives the final two weeks of summer 15000+ times.  I honestly believe the only reason I enjoyed this was because I was prepared as watching the episodes as they aired only to encounter the same episode 8 weeks in a row would be incredibly frusturation.  Anyway my biggest let down for this season was that aside from a very well done first episode all that remains is the Endless Eight and The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya which is simply the making of a film shown during the first season.   While the episodes are by no means bad I am left craving more story and that is this season's only downfall.,1401,564,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,1402,565,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was fun and kind of funny but it tried to be way more then it was.  Im going to do this review a little differently because this anime was a little different.  It started off ok and it was interesting but it got out of control.  There were serious parts that seemed waaaaaay to serious to match the mood of the story.  The loop in time episodes were interesting but right at the end it got really stupid.  The characters began being dumb.  Koizumi was being a dick and trying to convince everyone to go along with all of the out of control bull that Haruhi was trying to pull.  Kyon started doing stupid things and Haruhi was being a freakshow.  The situations closer to the end of the series became ridiculous and again they were way too serious for a light anime like this.  It dropped my initial 7 down to a 6 for this anime..,1403,566,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First off the Haruhi series started out great I myself am not a massive Haruhi addict however this is just one of those series that must be watched well at least the original. But if you are yet to watch the 2009 series be prepared to be dissapointed the majority of the limited 14 episode spent watching the same thing over and over with only slight differences.,1404,567,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is about this loud cunt Haruhi that goes to high school all the time. She goes pretty much every day because she's a legit gang leader. She forces people to be in her gang and then terrorizes them ruthlessly. She definitely doesn't fuck around and will kill everyone that tries to quit her gang. She likes feeling up girls and slave driving her gang into doing typical high school bull. She makes them play sports go to school events steal shit and do summertime activities.,1405,568,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So this is an animé about a girl who is actually quite intolerable but her  friends  still hang out with her and obey her every whim because they have orders to watch her and because they're too scared about what might happen to the world should they upset her in any way. The protagonist Kyon I think is supposed to be the only one with moral enough to stand up to Haruhi and he... doesn't. ,1406,569,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Comparing two seasons of Haruhi it’s obvious that the 2nd is an absolute collapse. It’s really sad. Animation and music are still great but the story.. I guess I’m not the only one who was disappointed – we were waiting for something better. Much better.,1409,572,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First off I should preface this review by stating that The Melancholy ofaruhi Suzumiya is one of my outlier amines.  What I mean by this is Ienerally avoid the comedy-school slice of life genre and stick with otherypes of anime.  But at the recommendation of a female friend of mine whoas excellent taste in anime I picked up the first season.  It wasreat!  Clean animation and good music mixed with interesting charactersnd a mysterious story where you have no idea what will happen next. nfortunately the second season doesn't deliver as well as the first basedostly around poor direction.,1413,576,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Andriod Kikaider is one of THE MOST AWESOME ANIME I've ever watched.  It depicts the awakening of a soul within the brain/heart of a complete robot.  Everything is perfect concerning this anime due to the ALL OF IT certified GOODNESS of the story.  The story follows what I will refer to in my reviews as  the badass blueprint .   The badass blueprint  has the main character seemingly wandering looking for answers to the most important questions in life and doing random good deeds along the way.   The blueprint  also includes the hero following the  Book of the Five Rings  but they've never read it cause it is in their hero DNA. Kikaider has several robot siblings a creator creator's neice and creator's son to help show him the way.  The bad guy is awesome because HE DOES EVERYTHING A BAD GUY is supposed to do (like laugh at most things) as in implement a plan to take over the world and shut down everything in his path.  Kikaider is in his PATH.  However Kikaider's like my cousin Gingee  You can't beat me unless you eat me you can't eat me unless you beat me!   DEAL WITH IT!,1432,595,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime isn't for people who are desperate for second to second intervals of fanservice and action.  That isn't to say that there is a significant absence of action but rather it isn't the point of the story.,1436,599,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Although it is an anime where giant robots fight each other the action is slow and usually won't last long. No epic fighting scenes here. What this anime is trying to do is to reveal several moral and ethical questions and is more suited for people who like to think. People who like action series like Bleach or Naruto probably won't like this very much. People who like  shows like Serial Experiments Lain will probably love this. It has a similar dark and depressing feel than Serial experiments Lain actually.,1437,600,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was in a bit of a mood one day and casually clicked around on the site when I found this anime that was supposed to be Evangelion with less action.

Bokurano affected me. I don't mean the mood I can certainly handle depressing anime what I mean is the quality. Bokurano like Gundam SEED Destiny is the sort of anime where I watch it knowing it's bad but not too bad and with its interesting premise there's a good anime just waiting to come out so I keep watching it waiting patiently for the good anime to emerge. It never does and I give up. With Bokurano however I had made it to the last episode so I finished it off. ,1443,606,2019-04-13 21:35:40
WoW it's been a long time since I have seen an anime this good. Vivisqueen summed it up very well in her review so refer to there for more but let me just say I don't give out many 10/10's but this one earned every point. From the haunting music to the cast of unusually interesting characters some I liked others I loathed but all of whom held my attention during each and every episode.

I always feel a sense of intimidation when reviewing something that's a. critically acclaimed; or b. considered a  classic . Just my luck that Royal Space Force: Wings of Honneamise happens to be both. With my younger brother's incessant warnings about falling asleep in mind I watched the two-hour spectacle unfold. There's so much riding on this title. Renowned film critic Roger Ebert is all praises for it. Almost every online review I read gave it the highest ratings. It's one of the most expensive animated films ever made to boot. Wings of Honneamise is set in a world much like our own. Everything's a lot like Earth -- the people the culture etc. but it's not Earth. It's a time where space travel still considered a fantasy by most with only a few who are willing to try and make it a reality. Thus when Shiro volunteers for the space project his colleagues are flabbergasted. After previous unsuccessful attempts (some even resulting in death) one would have to be crazy to volunteer. But Shiro had the vision and the open-mindedness to see past the bad and he truly believed that what he'd be doing would help mankind advance into the future. There was no turning back and so the story goes... Wings of Honneamise possesses a certain realism which is not unlike what you'd experience when watching so-called  serious  titles such as  Grave of the Fireflies  or  Rail of the Star . It has a very mature approach to the subject at hand and I can understand why younger viewers would not be able to appreciate it fully. I liked the way the main character Shiro gradually developed along with the situation and I found myself rooting for him and the project till the end. It's a story about how man transcends various obstacles in order to progress. But I also read that in portraying a world without belief in space travel Gainax (Yes it is from Gainax!) also meant to portray a society without belief in the potential of anime. This film is open to so many levels of interpretation -- there are various religious moral cultural and political issues to contend with amidst the basic premise of man's first journey to space. Yet despite that no part of it is hard to understand. It's straightforward storytelling without cryptic dialogues and symbolisms. The art and animation are quite impressive especially for something that was originally released way back in 1987. The character designs are rather dour though although Shiro strikes me as something of a great big teddy bear with his friendly face. Each scene is rendered in great detail making it fairly obvious that no expense was spared in the making of this film. Wings of Honneamise is an excellent piece but I suggest you make sure that you like this kind of heavy stuff before grabbing yourself a copy.,1452,612,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Utewarerumono begins with a masked man. Rescued from the forest where he lay injured he is tended by the chief of a small village and her two granddaughters Elulu and Aruru. He has no idea who he is or why he is wearing a mask that won’t come off. It is a simple premise that over the course of 26 episodes blossoms out into something truly epic.,1475,631,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Yuru Yuri is a fun story about a few girls and their school club: The Amusement Club. Just as the club name presents itself they amuse themselves however they can when attending. The story is very loose and the only thing holding together any kind of themes is whether they'll be kicked out of their  adopted  clubroom. The clubroom was once utilized by the Tea Club but they disbanded and the room became unoccupied leaving the Amusement Club's founder a key to the clubroom's door. Thus the amusement and silly time begin. Yuru Yuri is very episodic with no true running theme (except the clubroom thing which turns into more of a running joke than anything). The story is definitely lacking so I gave the story a 6/10 for being average.,1480,636,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Yuru Yuri is one anime where I can’t ever say the name correctly on the first time because it’s too much of a tongue twister but that’s not going to stop me from indulging into the cuteness of the characters.,1486,642,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Yuru Yuri is nice comedy anime with 4 main girls characters actually all the characters in this anime are girls :). These girls at school establishes Amusement Club where they do nothing much like just hang around and lounges. But when they come up with something to do you can count on that you will not get bored. Just as the anime name presents itself this contains yuri but unfortunately only in small quantities...,1487,643,2019-04-13 21:35:40

An eclectic mix of swimsuit fan appeal niche military stuff info about school ships and some comedy. It's alright but not as  good as the original series. ,1497,653,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Well I watched this in English dub which made it worth watching because it was so cheesy predictable and bad that it was good. The plot is so similar to Ah My Goddess that it is sad. Instead of them being from heaven the girls are from the underworld. In English the voice actor is even the one who plays Keiichi too. It also resembles Sailor Moon and Magic Knights Rayearth. The only reason to watch this is to get a good laugh at a failed attempt. I recommend the dub because we tried watching in Japanese after and it is all serious which just makes it a bad plotline. ",1498,654,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of my favorite series that I've watched as well as the series that got me back into anime after taking a long break from it. Full of action suspense romance and twist and turns at every corner this series has just about everything in it as well as comedy mixing thoughout it very beautifullly. The art in this series is breathtaking and the voice acting is amazing. I didn't really have a problem with any of the characters (which for me is rare) and loved them all. This is a must watch series in my opinion and I simply cannot wait to watch it again and again.,1499,655,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Frankly the most annoying anime I have ever seen. It may be because I had to watch the terrible American dub but I wanted to strangle the characters three minutes into the first episode. Kagome was deeply irritating Inuyasha was seriously annoying and Lady Kaede's voice and way of speaking made me want to claw at my face in horror. I get that they're supposed to be from a long time ago when the Japanese language was different (in the way Elizabethan English is different to Modern English) but saying 'methinks' and 'ye' constantly just made me want to kill myself to get away from it. Consequently I only watched 8 episodes laughing hysterically at Seshoumaru and his transsexual getup. FanFiction.net was another thing that made it unwatchable: all the incest fics between Inuyasha and Seshoumaru. Urgh!,1501,657,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"InuYasha is one of thoughs animes that you either love it or you hate it. I am one of the ones who love it! I have been watching it since I was 13 years old.

I swear inuyasha is my all-time favorite anime. I did NOT start from the first episode at first but I watched the whole thing later. At first the animations weren't that good but they soon got better and better as the story went on. The characters are funny awesome and sometimes strait out stupid but that just makes it better. The best part about it is how random it is. Even a flash light made me crack up.,1504,660,2019-04-13 21:35:40

InuYasha was an amazing series it immediatly become my favorite I've fallen in love with the story it had an amazing soundtrack story chatacters animation was fantastic and the overall performance was awesome. It had everything that made an anime great it had comedy action romance history drama a great soundtrack a good story and amazing characters (Especially Sango (Anime crush :3) and Bankotsu. That is my review,1510,665,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I will admit this series has sooo many pointless episodes and random battles. kinda like with Naruto. But the actuall story to this is a great one. Its full of adventure action and even a little romance. I also liked the fact that every couple episodes the took a break and went back to kagome's time. This is were things get more into a teenage high school anime but still it mixes things up. This series will have you wanting more and more and can get quite addicting. You might even find yourself having a crush on of the main characters(Inuyasha for me),1511,666,2019-04-13 21:35:40
InuYasha is a very good anime if taken the time to watch. By this I mean that InuYasha is a fairly long anime and you have to be dedicated to actually get attached to the characters and love the anime in general. ,1512,667,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of the few i watched as a kid and made me the anime lover i am today It has a great story and sound for its time. It taught me life lessons when i was kid on how i should protect the ones i love It fueled my imagination with all the demons and martial arts fighters. too find out that they made another season with the help of anime-planet honestly made me happy to see that i can continue the story after all these years. I hope everyone who has not seen this anime yet loves it as much as i did. -NL,1513,668,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sealed to a tree for 50 years by the only woman the half demon Inuyasha had ever loved he is unsealed by her reincarnation born in modern times and returned to the past. Through a misshap a jewel known as the shikon no shana is shattered and as its kikyo's reincarnation Kagome's fault along with the newly awoken Inuyasha they must find the peices of the jewel. many friends are made and enemies defeated. Ending doesnt exist...really 4 movies are included and this is a great damn series My 1st fully owned one and well I don't regret it,1514,669,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright to be honest i LOVE this anime i got sucked in and got through the first 100 episodes like it was nothing......but........i got the point where it seemed that the same thing was happening over and over. Looking for the jewel big scary monster comes their way Inuyasha almost doesnt save them in time......he saves them in time......hugs hugs bleh back to looking for the jewel........AND REPEAT! I mean dont get me wrong i still love the anime. Although it seems to go on FOREVER but its still really well done. Funny scenes interesting twists at times good characters. And im not the type of person that is totally into this genre of manga  and loves anything semi-like it. I really dont care for this genre......but im super glad i tried it out. Love the series :) Love it. This is definitely something id suggest people try out.,1515,670,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of my absolute favorites. InuYasha's unique storyline drew me in and I couldn't help but watch Kagome's adventures in the feudal era. It was really fun watching how her relationship with InuYasha grew throughout the series. ,1516,671,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Honestly while growing up I watched a lot of anime that I don't really remember. But InuYasha is one that stuck with me for ages and helped me to branch off into other anime. I love the characters as well as the situations they all face and have to go through as well as the comedic parts....,1519,673,2019-04-13 21:35:40

No I didn't grow up with this show and I am kinda disappointed with that. However I started watching it at the age of thirteen and fell in love with it. I can wholeheartly tell you that if you watch this anime you will not be dissatisfied with it. This is a classic and you will not find another like it. I will warn you that this series is long so many people do drop the series in the middle of it. So this series may not be for everyone.,1524,676,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Inuyasha is the adventure of Kagome who was just a normal junior high school student until one day she fell down the well at the shine she lives at. This well is a portal to the waring states era in Japan and shortly after arriving she meets a boy name Inuyasha.  Kagome learns that she has the jewel of four souls contained in her body and after certain circumstances this jewel was released from her body and was shattered into thousands of shards and scatted across the country. Now Kagome must join forces with Inuyasha to retrieve all the shards and make the jewel whole again.,1528,680,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Shouldnt be any but better say this just to be safe ahem....WARNING: this review MAY contain spoilers you've been warned now with that out of the way lets get down to the review shall we. Quick description: Kagome is your average high school girl until one day she is dragged down to the bottom of her families shrines old well by crazy bug lady (aka the demon  Mistress Centipede ) who is after the the Shikon Jewel ( aka the Jewel of Four Souls) that is inside her body. But instead of just landing at the bottom of the well she finds herself transported 500 years in the past. Confused and lost she wanders the surrounding forest where she see's Inuyasha a boy with dog ears pinned to a tree who appears to be in a deep sleep. When Mistress Centipede tries to take the Jewel again in order to save herself (although she is told by all the villagers not to do it) she free's Inuyasha and he kills the crazy bug but (as i think we all seen coming) he turns his claws on kagome.

I’m pretty sure Ghibli is one of the only studios on earth capable ofaking a storyline like this one’s and making something worthwhile outf it. The plot has a kind of meandering silly quality to it thatould easily have turned to tedium but no; from the seeminglyoundless resources at Ghibli’s disposal the studio makes the movieork as a creative lighthearted and ultimately endearing show.,1539,691,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not going to lie this short little Ghibli work is pretty damn perfect as it should be.

Now before I get started this anime like many animes stopped before the manga had finished. Usually I'm fine with that. I can just continue the story by reading the manga. However I felt that Pandora Hearts stopped in a random place. At first I thought what did they run out of money?,1568,718,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Pandora Hearts based on the manga of the same name by Mochizuki Jun is often stated as Black Butler's sister series. It uses the same state of art shabby characters and even their setting is exactly the same. Nonetheless Pandora Hearts strikes as a highly creative series that surpasses even the ''mighty'' success of Black Butler. For me it is way better.,1572,722,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The only reason I didn't give this anime the 10/10 is because of the last episode.  It left so many things unanswered that it felt like there should be a sequel but there is none.  The story is strong up until the last few episodes so I would definitely rewatch this series again just for the character development as well as recommend it to others!,1573,723,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Charlotte is without a doubt the most hyped show of the season 2015 and I can see a lot of reasons why.

To start I'm not going to compare this anime with any other anime made by the same producer/company/bla bla bla.  I had a browse through some of the other reviews and it seems several are written based on how characters of this anime are so similar to others made by the same producer/writer/company/whatever.  My opinion will actually be about the anime itself and how I felt as I watched it.,1590,740,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really enjoyed this anime. It does remind me of Marvel's x men a bit though. The characters were great but due to its episode limit the characters lost further development. The story itself is truly unique and is very rare to find a story moving so smoothly in anime. I highly recommend this to anyone who does not want to see the usual school amines.,1591,741,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Charlotte was the one that had me interested before the season started and I must say Im very happy with it so far.,1595,745,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just simply looking at the synopsis of this anime makes me want to doze off. There isn’t not a single thing that I found remotely interesting or original in this anime. High schools teenagers with superpowers overused slapstick humor all the typical shit plague most anime nowadays. And it doesn’t help that it is also written by Jun Maeda a writer whose work always are far more concerned with manipulation the viewers emotions even when it doesn’t make any logical sense. But since I didn’t have anything good to do with my time I decided to watch this anime despite being put off at first. Now thirteen episodes later what do I think of it now? Well to put it simply this show was one of the worst experience with anime I had all year.,1596,746,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I stopped after the first episode but after a while I came back to it and realized what special anime I have been missing. � The amount of special abilities is superb and it might be confusing but it ends very well. � It's an anime with a solid ending. �,1597,747,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I started this because it got a fair number of recommendations on the Cowboy Bebop page. But the first two episodes had a very different vibe. Bebop was the ultimate cool but this is about a rather dorky everyman who hooks up with a bunch of rather generic smugglers. I'm not saying it's terrible it's actually perfectly watchable but it's just kind of bland. I feel like the characters and the writing are from a thousand other shows.,1600,750,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Black Lagoon... where to start? The story is to be blunt epic. It's completely believable showing the dark underbelly of humanity. The writer(s?) managed to blend the deep emotional and psychological themes common to most Japanese anime (that I've seen anyway) with the senseless violence and brutality that makes Western media just so darn entertaining. Pair it up with gorgeous artwork an absolutely perfect soundtrack and possibly the best sound effects ever heard in an anime and you have a dark evil masterpiece. The voice actors choses for the English dub were incredible as well capturing the sophistication of a Russian mob boss the vulgar humor and trash-talking of a hired gun and so many other unique and memorable characters. The characters themselves were amazing as well: from the dark and deeper-than-expected mercenary Revy and her horrifying past to the unusually plain but potentially explosive Japanese businessman Rock. Even the minor characters like the bartender and the various thugs that come get shot then vanish into a  muddy hole in the ground  show the signs of having plenty of thought and effort put into their creation. All in all Black Lagoon is a thrill ride of a series. I've watched it more than a hundred times and I still find myself coming back again and again.,1614,761,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: The story centers around Rock and his gradual acceptance into a group of  delivery boys  a group of mercenaries/pirates called the Lagoon Company. The story delves into the underbelly of gangs mafia and Russian ex-military. With a rich cast of characters and plenty of action the story is quick-paced and thrilling.,1621,766,2019-04-13 21:35:40

What a terrific series! At once both reminiscent of and yet drastically diffrent from Cow Boy Bebop Black lagoon is a action packed series of adventures involving the Lagoon Company made up of leader Dutch electronics expert Benny newcomer Rock and badass Revy. Everything from the animation to the writing to the scenes of over the top violence is fantastic. One of my favorite new anime and I cant wait to see season 2 and the OVA.,1624,769,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was probably one of the best animes i have seen in a long time. If you like guns then you will love this anime. Its basiclly about a regular guy joining pirates that work for gangs. He is brought into a new world in which he does not belong but with the help of Revy he learns alot about this new world. This anime is very good and anyone who likes hot-headedgun slinging killing animes will love this one! sorry about this review not being too long its just i watched this when i came out and now im writing this review some amany years later,1627,772,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If Quentin Tarantino were to make an anime this would be it. It has a pretty solid cast and you may not like them but they are pretty damn complex. The pacing is magnificent and connects from story to story without slowing down too much. My only real gripe with this is that the show is a little too phylisophical which can handicap the pacing a bit. ,1628,773,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Black Lagoon has it all. Uniuqe characters fresh story Fighting Badass Chick Guns and Death. Black Lagoon is the story of a man who gets kindnaped by a bunch of mercenary/pirates. These pirates turn his life upside side down but do not kill me. Long story short the man joins them and helps them on their adventures. The man learns how to stand up for himself and he brings a new dimention to the group.,1629,774,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I wish there was a category for environment in the scoring because this anime takes the meaning of that word to a whole new level. Roanapur is the most cacophonous display of everything a gang-run underworld should be; despite characters constantly reminding us how small the city is there seems to be niche for any and every crook or villian there. The scenery alone is enough to watch the series but the characters are another majpr selling point.,1632,777,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is pretty much garbage. You start off with people on a colony downtrodden hero ends up with gundam would die to save friends etc etc. Typical male hero that's lacking a pair between his legs. This anime like so many others coming out these days is OBSESSED with the notion that  We shuldnt hurt ppl gaiz!  and is sickeningly pacifist throughout the series. Not to mention they dangle this idea of  Laplace's box  in front of you for about 6 hours before you're given a single hint about what it is. Key characters threaten to be killed off all the time but magically survive.,1639,784,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It was very well done but if your going to watch this go into it with an open mind. I will admit that for about the first 20 mins in the art style had me thrown off a bit felt a bit wonky being used to watching only partially cgi anime's but its definitely by far the most impressive full cgi anime ive watched and really enjoyed it. I will say that there isnt alot of story to it its more of a jump right into it no backlog or how you got there but the charecter devolopment of the main charecter was good from the stand point of how the story is portrayed but I feel that there really was not enough development of the secondary charecters but it would have increased the film time quite a bit to have much more than they had done but would have been worth it imo. If you enjoy the futuristic genre its definitely worth the watch.,1647,791,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie was the same as the rest of Bleach and its movies -- had a good plot but didn't really have reasons to back up why all this crazy stuff was happening. *spoilers* Like these two siblings really admired Rukia from the past when she tried to save their lives so they went to Soul Society and erased her existence from that place so they could steal her away from the evil Soul Reapers and then they could all join together so they could form one being? *spoilers end*,1654,796,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The storyline was really great it tells you the story about Byakuya and his wife and his sister Rukia.But thats not the reason a love it. Its because it shows how much ichigo cares about rukia is the reason i love it. Because it shows how much you can care about someone and icigo shows that every time beweet his best friend Orihime and rukia the person who saved him and his family by giving his her soul reaper powers and you see that in this movie.,1656,798,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It was.. okay. Nothing really special but a ton better thenhe second movie. So many flashbacks of the first episode in the series that Ianted to fast forward quite a bit.

I only have 1 comment to this review which sums up the entire season of Jitsu wa Watashi wa:,1668,810,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Jitsu wa is a mediocre anime. You might not think so at first: you might think that it's actually something special as I myself did drawn in by the comedy nice animation and good songs and even after the bland ecchi filler starts to creep (read: rush) in even after you've heard the two  this is an emotional scene  songs ad nauseam you might as I did hold on to your hope that the snippets of character development and drama the show gives you every once in a while might actually turn in to something. But you as I would be wrong. This anime is based on a manga and the hum-drum status-quo story of that manga hangs around this anime's neck like a millstone dragging it to the bottom of a sea of similar shows. Were it not for that this anime might have been good but as it is you can pretty much just stop watching at any time and not have missed anything. And one of the best places to stop watching this anime is before you even start.,1669,811,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love the way Kohina acts. Her mental state and her gestures are fantastic. The reactions of each characters are perfect for this type of anime. The story is cutesy standard fantasy stuff. The animation manages to mix moe with harder features using the characters. The background is lacking in many respects but that's not really important simply because the focus isn't on the background. The focus is very upfront and on the surface. When they do focus on the background like with episode 10 and the Maple tree they do a very good job. The sound is great. I love the choices for the music and the characters' voices are spot-on. The way that Kohina gasps is one of my favorites... She tries to maintain her robot image but sometimes she slips which brings hr kawaii/moe nature to the fore-front and builds her complex nature regardless of how simple she would like to appear at first glance. The characters themselves are nothing particularly special (except Kohina) but I gave them a 9 because they are portrayed very well.,1678,820,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Addictions… they are something that you can put your whole life and wellbeing into not caring who you harm and sometimes even forgetting why you started it to begin with. No this is not a two step ‘drug addiction’ seminar; it’s the start of a strange twist of fate for Watanuki and his friends. The movie starts out like any other episode of the anime really with Watanuki being loaded down with a mass of spirits who all seem to want his attention up till he finally reaches the place that he works at Yuuko’s wish granting house where he works like a slave for her. I can understand why they started it out with this as there is a need to explain who the characters are within the movie but for people like me who know the story from both the anime and manga it feels like a cop out. The reason why Watanuki is working at Yuuko’s place is so he would not have this trouble with spirits hanging on him all the time but here we see that even though he has been working there a little while the spirits do bother him. I can feel a little bit of annoyance when Yuuko talks about how he doesn’t see them that much but that’s because he is working at her place. Outside of that nothing has changed at all (At least that’s how it feels).,1691,831,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I will keep this review fairly short since I have all ready written one for the first season. The quality remains consistent through story animation and sound though I do find the females more likable in this season with the exception of Chihiro (I think that was the name). In addition the ending was much more appropriate and strongly suggested a third opening by showcasing the females to come as opposed to having an open-ending with much left to be desired. If you enjoyed the first the second will be just as good and will not disappoint for the most part. I actually had a slight preference for this second season.,1698,837,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A continuation from the first this basically adds two more girls into the mix. Other than that nothing changes much. Once again Kurumi has very little presence which is unfortunate. The biggest problem about this season is that the ending really doesn't end and unless there is a 3rd season to come (which seems doubtful due to lack of popularity) it is left feeling unfinished. ,1710,848,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of the best story driven anime I have seen ,1719,853,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of my most favorite anime of all time. It truly is a shame that this ended with a cliffhanger. This just convinces me that people don't appreciate good things in life anymore.,1720,854,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wasn't sure how I would feel about a show titled Legend of the Legendary Heroes when I first saw the translated name. I mean how unimaginative can you get? Still what you get is far more than what the title gives you...,1721,855,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was by far one of the best anime I have seen this year. The story line is pretty good and the characters are funny. The only downside of it is that it kind of jusr ends partway into the story which sucks. But overall its pretty good ,1722,856,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I personally found this anime to be very entertaining and interesting despite the storytelling and development issues. I really liked Ryner as a main character because of the fact that even though he seems to be a person with little surface issues what IS shown of his past dictates otherwise. While the whole lazy main character that can become incredibly overpowered at perfect moments cliche was there at least once I found myself unable to dislike many of the characters animation and the overall world of Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu. I am anxiously waiting in the hopes of an announcement of season 2. Overall I would give this an 8.5/10,1723,857,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The Legend of the Legendary Heroes. Doesn't really grab you does it? That's the last time I judge an anime by the title until the next time I do and I forget to not judge it. But when I looked past it I saw a Comedy/Semi-political/Fantasy-Action series multi-hybrid. Kinda reminds me of Code Geass but without the cheese and mechs. With it's fingers in a multitude of genre jars it makes itself a fine sandwich if you don't look too closely at what the sandwich's made of. I sure didn't and I had a blast.,1724,858,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,1725,859,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It follows a young man named Reiner Lute (sp?) who happens to have cursed eyes. He's a lazy bum who wants to nap his life away but submits to his best friends whims since he has become king during his absence. Reiner Lute fears his abilities and his lack of control over it. He's accompanied by a young lady who loves to over dramatize his perverted tendencies and indulge in dango!,1726,860,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Legend of Legendary heros caught my eye in an amv.  It was the 3rd episode and you will know why it caught my eye when you see that episode.  I had started it previously and then read that it did not cover the entire light novel.  At that I put it down.  I returned to it after some consideration.  Im glad I did.  It has a  political  tag which means that it was going to get crazy.  Well it did and I really ended up loving it.,1727,861,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So…this review is sort of…well difficult. I think I liked the show but then again I’m not entirely sure that I have any idea of what actually happened. The world it’s set in is pretty interesting the characters are decent and I really enjoyed the different kinds of magic involved as well. It was simply missing…something. Or I dunno maybe it just had too much…,1728,862,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The anime was terrible the plot was everywhere it was terrible one plot line after other and at the end nothing gets solves seriously if you watnt o watch this just kill yourself now to avoid the pain of watching this shit,1729,863,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is... kind of confusing. There are some aspects of it that do not make sense. Either they will be explained in a sequel (if they make one which i think they will) or they  left it up to your imagination . For example the king (silver hair) is in some sort of emotional agony because of the unforseen responsibilities of his position. In order to acheive the world that he wants he has to do things he doesnt want to or is very hard to achieve (and also is he doing it for himself the public or ryner?). That is reality in a sense. People tell you that you can do anything you want if you just never quit and always put in much effort but thats bull shit. If i want to fly two minutes from now from the power of my mind alone I cant do it. A dream most often not only entails the end result but what it takes to achieve it along the way; therefore dreams are most often... only dreams.,1731,864,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu despite its repetitive name is quite the anime in terms of action character developement and its subtle examination of human nature in terms of fear and its correlation to ignorance. Some have complained that the story is broken or jagged and that it is difficult to follow but in my opinion if you are paying attention the plot becomes quite easy to understand. Without revealing anything considered a spoiler i'll say that the main character has a certain charm that not only radiates with the heroine of the show but also allows for lots of comedic exploits that result in something between Elfen Lied and GINTAMA. While possibly not in the same league as the previously mentioned anime it should be noted that the action and especially in terms of the complex magical system at work is interesting and not boring in the least allowing the viewer to see multiple styles of  Magic  without it ever becoming boring or redundant. Each country has their own designated but different array of spellwork and the main character has something similar to the sharigan allowing him to use many different spells. This power also leads to much of the pain and sorrow felt by all characters involved and also plays into the fear and ignorance so rampant in human nature. Philosophy aside with Densetsu's political intrigue loaded (albeit quite violent) action underlying romance and mystery its certainly an anime anyone should watch at least once while being mindful to have some patience with at least the first few episodes because after that you won't regret it.,1734,867,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first I have to say is that it's sad that there is no second season. They could have shown us so many other things. But sadly it didn't sell good. However this is an anime with nearly no bad or annoying characters. That's very important for me cause sometimes it ruins the hole story. I had no moments where I told myself that I should drop the anime. All in all it's a good anime.,1735,868,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay I will admit that when I first started watching The Legend of the Legendary Heroes I laughed at the title.  It clearly wasn't the most imaginative title out there and then I chuckled for the first couple of minutes of the show and by the end of the first episode I didn't think this was going to be anywhere near decent.  To which for the first couple of episodes I was clearly right and wasn't enjoying the series in the slighest bit.  But then it happened the most unbelievable thing ever the series started to get good.  So what brought about this change you might be wondering well I'll just say this.  That things quite unexpectedly got fairly violent.  From that turn onward the series takes on a much more of a action political feel to it.  With the main character of Ryner and Ferris as well as quite a few supporting characters providing all the action and Sion taking care of all the politics of the anime as he tries to change the world.  By the time the series ends you will definitely be left with more questions than answers and will probably want to know what happens next.  I will admit that by the time I had finished the series I realized that my intial opinions of the show was quite wrong and I began to wonder when the sequel would come out so that some those questions would be answered.  This is a fairly good series to check out if but just be warned that the ending will leave things unfinished so if that is something that bothers you then I would suggest waiting until hopefully the second season comes before picking this up.,1736,869,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm not sure how this anime has such a high score do other people just have a much higher tolerance for unlikable characters and a generic plot? This anime is so absolutely cookie cutter it's a joke that it has a rating of around 4 stars.,1737,870,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,1738,871,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'll keep this short and simple. If you've seen Death Note already you should know what to expect. This is essentially the first 2/3 of the series. You should read the other reviews and the Death Note reviews if you don't know a lot about Death Note. I rated this more highly than Death Note because the first 2/3 are all that Death Note should have been. It's a highly entertaining anime series but after this point things get rather dull.,1746,879,2019-04-13 21:35:40

       This is a music video done by CLAMP that features a bunch of their characters including those from xxxHolic Tsubasa Cardcaptor Sakura Magic Knights Rayearth Kobato Chobits Clover Wish Angelic Layer X and others. The plot if you can even call it that is the two Mokonas running around the different dimensions running into all the characters. The animation is beautiful and the music is catchy so it's a nice watch. A nice improvement over the first music video.,1752,885,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kyoukai no Rinne starts off rather slow but when you eventually get to the plot it gets much more fun and interesting. This is a series that so far I recommend sticking with. It is easy watching and rather light-hearted. ,1754,887,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At first this gets to a slow start you dont really know whats going on. Then at huge speed you get hit with the plot. There is tons of moments you want romance to occur but its seems there are block head moments here. Its packed with funny moments and great story lines. It always leaves you with the feeling I CANT WAIT TILL THE NEXT ONE ,1756,889,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Gunparade March is a blend of sci-fi drama romance mecha slice of life and action.  That's a lot of categories to fit one anime under but Gunparade March pulls it off admirably.  It stars a group of teenagers from the ages of 16+ that maintain pilot and other things that were poorly mentioned.  Although there was much to love about this anime such as the romance there was also much to make the viewer feel like things were left out of connivence.  In the world of Gunparade durring world war 2 an alien species appears whipping out the majority of man kind pretty much ONLY leaving Japan.  It sounds great but it's also what makes this show fall apart a bit.,1759,892,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Even Johnny Yong Bosch could not save this movie.  Its story had potential but I felt it was dragged on way too long and didn't explain enough.  You kind of had to jump on and try to grasp everything yourself.  I know it's a classic and everyone says it's fantastic but personally it didn't do it for me.  I love JYB but I won't waste another two hours of my life on this even for him.,1761,894,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Akira is one of the greatest anime movies I've ever seen. I don't think it had any dull parts between the beginning and the end. I loved the twist(s) at the end and the way the story evolved as I kept watching.,1763,896,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Akira is a milestone in the Japanese animation department that are still looked upon to this day as a artistic success. To believe that the animators completed this movie the way they did without modern day technology is a great achievement. The soundtrack for the movie fits so well with the atmosphere that you can't help but imagine the different sounds that it took to complete the movie's chaotic beats. For an action film of it's time Akira showed viewers and critics alike that a well thought out story can mesh well with an all-out animated epic.,1765,898,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Akira was a lot of fun to watch. The characters are reasonably interesting and the futuristic / rebuild Neo-Tokyo  setting is quite good (although not unheard of these days with all the futuristic / post-apocalyptic settings). ",1766,899,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie was... Incredible. I really didn't understand what was going on during most of it but at the same time the story was so compelling that I just couldn't stop. I still have a lot of questions but I have a feeling that was the goal- to make you think really think. It simply blew my mind and in a good way.,1768,901,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Saw this in the theater when it came out in America. Kind of disappointing. The whole film feels like it is on the edge of something happening but the something never happens. Even the score is like that with a few pounding notes here and there always feeling like some powerful energetic theme is about to start but never does. When it arrived this was touted as the film that would make the world see anime as a great art form but I think that oversold what this product is. If you liked  Ghost in the Shell  you'll probably like this but  Ghost  was better.,1769,902,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Akira was the first anime I saw that I knew as anime. Quite possibly caused me to actively seek out more of it's kind though very little was available at the time of it's US release.,1770,903,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well this film was definitely an experience. It took me only a few minutes to realize the animation was superb. It really was a visual delight. The opening sequence was just the tip of the iceberg of what was in store for this one. I adore surreal movies and this bizarre ride of utterly beautiful and horrific imagery had me glued to my tv for just over two hours. The characters themselves are so-so in my opinion with the exception of Tetsuo who was at once creepy and lovely. I watched the film on adult swim also so I saw it with the new and improved dub. As I said the stand out was Tetsuo but I also really liked the Colonel. Surprisingly I didn't so much like Johnny Yong Bosch's Kaneda. It was a lot of yelling and his character was very back and forth with his emotions. One minute he was scared and the next he was flirting and laughing with Kei. It was a bit weird so I may need to sit through it a second time with the subs. ,1778,911,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I finished this film a few hours before the writing of this review and I have to say this may not be the best time to write it.  The feelings are still fresh in my mind the emotions still present the visuals still stuck in my eyes.  I'm writing based on what amounts to a gut visceral response to a masterpiece of a film that I liked far more than I thought I was going to.  This is largely because I had high hopes for the film which is one of the most famous anime movies of all time and they were by and large lived up to.,1779,912,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For me this the best anime movie of all time. I know it's a compressed sotry of the manga but it's so great. The story while being confusing at first is great after 2 or three listening. The animation for a 1988 anime is a great achievement. There are animes today who can't compete with this gem. The sound is good quality. The characters are great. I like Kaneda but it's Tetsuo the star of this anime. ,1782,915,2019-04-13 21:35:40

    Like many i consider Akira to be the greatest Japanese Animation film of all time. The content and story are maybe not for everyone and i feel strange suggesting this film...because if you know what anime is and you are on this site then chances are you've already seen Akira. But just in case you haven't or are interested in the articulation of this greatness then here we go.,1785,918,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is truly a piece of Japanese animation history it inspired the creator of Dragonball Z to create manga and anime after he saw a poster for it .   And Dbz is a series that's had alot of influence on Japanese animation and I wouldn't be surprised if it has inspired other artists . I've watched both versions of this film the original dub and the dub that was most recently aired on Toonami.   Whether your interested in seeing something that paved the way for great anime as a whole or simply wish to watch a great film I highly recommend this movie .,1786,919,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I LOVE this anime. Although most of it is eather to make fun of a country teach you about it or it's just there for entertainment and randomness - some of the episodes it acually teaches you about history in a way that you can really remember it! (I survived history class because of it.) It even mentions micronations! Like Sealand!! (Who is adorable but mine),1790,923,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I may be slightly biased as I'm pretty much in love with the subject History but I absolutely adored this series.,1791,924,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've seen many people who claim to love Hetalia. I was thinking  Hetalia what the hell is that? Probably something just EVERYBODY loves for no reason (insert eye roll here)  But then I sat down and watched it. Learning that each  episode  is about 5 minutes long interested me. How could they make any progress with 5 freakin minutes?,1792,925,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hetalia is a brilliant anime and though it might not be for everyone I encourage you to give it a try It is very humorus and I enjoyed watching it immensely. I think they might have gone a bit off the rails in season 5 'a beautiful world' but other than tht I highly recomend it!,1795,928,2019-04-13 21:35:40
" Hetalia  is a mockery to millions of people that died during World War II please do not support this trash. ",1796,929,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved how the characters were all unique in their own way. The story followed history for the most part but made it ten times funnier. I laughed throughout the whole thing and I found Hetalia:axis powers to be very fuuny and overall a very enjoyable anime.,1797,930,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of the most creative and humorous productions that I have ever seen! The anime mirrors history in an enjoyable manner and every so often an abstract idea is also placed into the mix to make things more interesting like !Chibitalia or !Nekotalia (References make sense once you watch the show) The show itself personifies every nation as a person and provides a more fictional view of history based on the way that they interact with each other. In all honesty this is worth anyone's time for multiple reasons. ,1798,931,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is a good laugh and is at the same time a history lesson. Every country is portrayed as a single person in the time of ww1 and ww2 I think and follows Italys adventures (I believe Hetalia translates to Italy due to the theme song sounding like Im Hetalia) ,1802,934,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is a fairly good anime because it has a good story line to it. In this anime I like that almost every epiosde is a different kind of adventure for Natsume. This anime has very good animation to it I like the details that are put into the characters. The sound of this anime is very good. I like some of the music in it and also I like most of the male characters voices. I love most of the characters in this anime because most of them are really awesome people. I also like how Natsumes friends stick to him when he seems upseat. So over all this is a good anime to watch.,1815,945,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Natsume Yuuhjinchou (AKA Natsume’s Book of Friends) is a 13 episode episodic supernatural drama anime featuring a lot of Japanese mythology and a pinch of comedy. This anime reminded me of XXXHOLiC a lot and feels very similar in a slice of life episodic way. It’s a positive and relaxed anime with themes of peace and friendship but it does have some action. The main character has a long term goal and for that this anime has a main story arc.,1818,948,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The makers of this series seem to be masters of old entertainment saying:  Always leave them wanting more.   Some characters develop over time while others are revealed over time.  One thing leads to another and you wind up being pulled in.  We started the first episode thinking  lets give it shot  and wound up marathoning the whole thing in a few days.,1826,956,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One thing I can say right off is this show has the best animation quality perhaps ever seen.  It is a perfect blend of the older style anime with the big eyes and proportioned bodies married to a slightly more realistic looking set of characters.  The eyes are just the right size between anime and realistic yet still retain that aura of anime.  The shadows are soo natural it is often hard to believe you are only watching anime and not live action.  The background images are near perfect if not perfect.  ,1829,959,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well there are already two detailed reviews on here one praising this show and one saying it couldn’t have been much worse.  Allow me to give a dispassionate middle of the road review.  I really enjoyed Knights of Sidonia but it certainly had its share of flaws and a couple of WTF moments.  Maybe its because I grew up with Macross and Megazone 23 but I like this kind of anime.  I don’t watch exclusively sci-fi anime but as I turn to look at my DVD shelves right now I can’t help but notice my anime is about 80% sci-fi.  So hey if you are looking for a giant spaceship/mecha/action anime I think you have found your next series.  Still it’s definitely not a perfect ten.,1837,967,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kind of a weird way on how I came across this anime.  So I subscribed to this Let's Play Channel called  TheSw1tcher .  If you are familiar with them then you know they have a weekly show called  Friday Night Fisticuffs .  On that show they play fighting games.  One night they played two games:  And old-school  Jojo's Bizarre Adventure  and a more modern one.  After hearing them talk about weird things about the show I became really interested.,1842,972,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not a typical shounen. If you're expecting Naruto-style you'll be disappointed. The characters are not very likeable. An interesting fact may be that characters are named after various music groups (which can also be considered laziness while inventing names). Animation may not be suitable for everyone as it consists of mostly pictures (proper animation is rare) also it feels cell-shaded.  Covers Part 1 and Part 2 of the manga with 9 episodes focusing on part 1 and the rest focusing on part 2. I liked part 1 more because I found the protagonist and the main villain more interesting and the ending was surprising to me unlike part 2.,1843,973,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Really the only redeeming feature of Angel's Tales is that it makes for very good riffing material. Basically Goro the dude that this animorphs are supposed to swoon over can be replaced with a cardboard cut-out and nobody would notice half the time. He plays the harmonica (riff I made  I tell ya bein' a folk singer today is like bein' a dinosaur with somethin' to say yea! ) So what is fundamentally wrong with this plot? Well good writing is believable. Much of the plot is not believable. (Example #1: somehow they are able to afford things for everyone on a part-time salary. I wish I could find a part-time job that paid that good. Example #2: after the goddess sends three animorphic babes who start fighting over him what do you think the dumbest thing she could do here to get the fighting to stop? If you said send more sexy animorphs to him you're right.)  The music was quite forgettable and in this case that's a good thing. Most of the animoroph girls were exceptionally annoying. It was supposed to be a cute anime but it is packed with too much fail.,1864,994,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is my 2 favorite anime because the charaters are well drawn and the plot itself is intersting.this anime is about a girl named Nanami ( i think this is how u spell her name) who goes to a music school because she loves playing the piano. she meets 6 handsome guys who she kinda helps out and they help her out. they all fall in love with her and ask her to be there parner but she can onlyn choose one. In the end she chooses all of them and they create a very lovely song. Maji love 1000%. (u can hear it in You Tube).  Sorry my english is not very good,1874,2,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story line of the anime is very straight forward unlike some other animes that go off onto side storys this one sticks to a main point and goal. I really love this anime but it sucks that it ended. I love the characters of this anime because they are really awesome people and they are also well devoloped.The sound of the anime is very good and I don't think that it drowns out the characters voices that often only once in a while. The animation of the anime is very good and there are alot of details in some spots.,1878,3,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay I was not a big fan of the animation but it was good otherwise. The music throughout was great some soothing some upbeat but completely addictive. In fact one of the reasons I continued to watch it was the music. I loved the opening and closing music as well. The main character well she annoyed me and was my least favorite out of everyone. Her harem consisted of my favorite characters. All those personalities brought together and meshed to make amazing music. The story is interesting and progressed fairly steadily.

Recently someone asked me what my favourite anime was. It's impossible to pick just one anime but I just happened to be re-watching Princess Tutu so it was easy for me to say that definetely Princess Tutu is one of the best. It's one of those anime for both children and adults; as a matter of fact grown ups will probably get much more out of it than children. It combines a really good story with good characters and decent character development good pacing interesting and sometimes thought-provoking themes nice art and great music. The result is an emotionally involving anime that leaves you with a smile on your face but also feeling sad that the story ended and you won't be seeing anymore of the characters.,1897,22,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I was surprised by this anime. The first episode was good but then from then on I was a bit unsure if this was just going to be another Mecha show with nothing unique in it... Well I ended up stopping at about episode 13 or so but then as soon as i watched a couple more I watched all the way to ep 24 in one night. The rest was very good and took a lot of twists that I didn't expect. I felt that it was somewhat unique which can be hard to come across. ,1907,32,2019-04-13 21:35:40

as someone who kind of likes those animes where a high school student saves the day with a giant robot (i.e. Linebarrels of Iron Full Metal Panic Evangelion …you get the idea) I liked this one. The love interest part in this was a little different. Normally it’s the two that hate each other through most of the series but in this one they already like one another and it’s the “death” of Shōko Sashinami that throws Haruto into a bit of a rage and vows to kill every Dorssian. Bit different but still some of the same. I was really surprised on who got in the Purple Valvrave in the last episode. I’m not going to say who but it was a person who never even crossed my mind to get in a Valvrave. I am really glad that there is a second season because that was not one of those anime endings where you might think they could just leave it there. No this was a cliff hanger ending.,1910,35,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The only reason this show would receive such an average score for me would be that it was not long enough. Since there was only one season much of the story seemed rushed. The way characters were introduced and the way that questions remained unanswered it seemed to set up the story line to have multiple seasons. However in the last couple episodes everything seemed rushed and not thought through. The very end was slightly confusing and unsatisfying. However despite this unfortunate abrupt end the story was compelling and entertaining. It was full of humor censored nudity action romance and interesting characters.,1919,44,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's hard for me to describe this anime but I think surreal is a fitting word. The plot was handled very strangely and it reminded me of a dream. It could've been good if they slowed down gave you time to learn about the world and explained more and maybe cut back on some of the more fantastical things.,1930,55,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just want to make this short and simple. I found this anime while looking for a good ecchi to watch which is unusual for a girl but hey. The basic roundabout of the story is that the main character who aspires to be a high priest transfers to a school that deals with magic and occult stuff. When he gets there as a new student he has to go to some bird that acts like the sorting hat in Harry Potter which much to everyone dismay tells him that he WILL become the new Demon Lord. Ok so this was funny and was enough of a plot for me to like it. I waited every week to watch this anime because well it was hilarious.,1931,56,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Having seeing so many episodes you could geuss what was going to happen next. The show had great music and sound. The Jappanese voices fit very well with the characters. The animation to this I think was better than in the ova. In this Shuichi is much cuter than in the ova. It did a great job of expressing Shuichi's feelings.

Gravitation is and probably always will be one of my favourite anime.,1942,66,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime falls flat on romance. I'm 4 episodes in and there is no development between the main character and the love intrest not even a hint. Theres only two other problems i have with it. One the main character feels over the top and fills in comedy releaf when there is no need for it. And two theres hardly any interaction with the couple and at one point the main character acts as if he knows all these facts about his love interest but no where in the anime did they show that interaction between the two.,1943,67,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Achei a estória de Gravitation super interessante. O que mais me surpreendeu foi o fato do quão frio o Yuki era com o Shuichi. Sei lá acho que estava acostumada com o uke fugindo o tempo inteiro e tals. Em alguns episódios cheguei a sentir ódio pelo Yuki ser tão frio com o Suichi e em alguns eu sentia ódio porque o Shuichi era chato e grudento.  Mas devo confessar que gostei muito desse anime por causa dessas inúmeras sensações que me fez passar. Eu gosto quando o anime deixa um impacto sobre mim e me faz querer guarda-lo. Eu assisti aos 13 episódios super rápido o que é incrível pois geralmente acabo sem motivação param  assisti-los rapidamente e até levo um bom tempo para assistir um anime mesmo sendo ele bom. O que mais me animou também foi o mistério que envolvia o passado do Yuki mistério este que só é revelado no último episódio!!! Acho que eu não botava fé nesse casal porque o Shuichi era o único realmente interessado (e obcecado digamos assim) então eu surtava e muito quando o Yuki demonstrava um tiquinho de simpatia por ele e até o ajudava (raramente) em algumas coisas. Sobre as OVAS eu não gostei tanto quanto o anime porque achei muito visível as mudanças principalmente nos gráficos. Parecia que as OVAS foram feitas uns 50 anos antes do anime e estava com uma aparência velha e tals. A primeira OVA mexeu muito comigo porque eu fiquei chateada com Yuki e com o Shuichi nela. O Yuki mas frio do que de costume e Shuichi mais chato e idiota (o que achei surpreendente). Teve uns momentos que me deu bastante raiva do Shuichi chorando para o Yuki achei desnecessário parecia uma garota hehe. Porém o final da segunda OVA foi interessante e até bonitinho entretanto quando eu assistir de novo Gravitation irei ver apenas aos 13 episódios não me agradou muito essas OVAs. ,1946,69,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Gravitation has to be not only my favourite anime but favourite show!,1947,70,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Maki Murakami's manga Gravitation introduced  boy's love  or male romance to a whole generation of manga readers. The TV adaptation of Gravitation did the same thing for a generation of anime watchers when it originally debuted in 2000. The show toned down the explicitness of the original story a bit for TV which had the effect of making the show that much more accessible for people who weren't already fans of the original.,1949,71,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Berserk is an excellent anime. There is a lot of violence and rape in the story though. It has a lot of twists and turns some you wouldn't expect were coming. It's really amazing to see Guts' growth from a inconsiderate social outcast to a caring and humble man. ,1954,75,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The reason i have given this anime this score is because it does not fufil the things that makes this anime. Berserk is anime built for action and slight drama. Its animation is good but outdated there are the only good characters are Guts the rest seem to be in the background. The story is sort of lost and the begining makes no sense. I like the anime but it seems to rushed in a way but atleat its nomt 100 episodes. The problem I have with the story is it makes you look like a noob who only like dragons and dungeons. I would recomend this anime but if you don't like dragons and dungeons genre stay clear. I mean i dont like the genre but i enjoyed it. Like follow and have a great day.,1967,87,2019-04-13 21:35:40

No doubt when it comes to story telling this anime ranks near the top. The articulate weaving of destiny wrote by the creators is a tale that can inspire anyone of any age to dream. The only breakdown of the story is that the last two episodes left alot and I mean alot of confusion and holes in the story. There is no question that this would have been a much higher ranking anime series if the last two episodes wouldn't of blown everything into massive confusion. I assume that the cause of this is based upon the fact that it doesn't cover the entire manga.,1983,100,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I credit this anime for making me love anime.  I had gotten very good at predicting what would happen next in everything i watch but with this show nothing turn out the way i thought it would.

This is one of those series that any comedy fan must watch. It's one that'll be much appreciated and loved. Altough it posesses no overall story plot it manages to keep up a good face. watching through this series there was not a moment of it that I didn't enjoy and I found myself laughing to the very end. The only downside is I couldn't bring myself to watch them one after each other since.... well... on one side I was really worried about laughing too much and on the other hand the lack of a plot could easily be felt. Considering all these things your time won't be wasted if you even have a small understanding of humor. :),2001,116,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't give this a full review because I only watched 4 episodes but mainly I dropped this show because the main character is so retarded I just couldn't watch him another second. I gave him 4 good episodes to man up and he did at the end of 3 so I though surely this anime will improve now right? WRONG! Episode 4 right back to being a total idiot wuss. Shame really the anime had great potential.,2003,118,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright they don’t really say this in the show but ‘Seven months later…’ we have the same group pretty much with the same comedy the same personalities the same goals and fate has decided once again to make them meet. This is where it gets slightly ridiculous in that nothing seems to stop this bunch from having to be stuck together. I guess the writers found that we were getting tired of the small area that the Slayers was taking place in and decided to open it up a little by saying the area where they lived was in a magical bubble. They now have a whole world we now have to learn about after finally maybe understanding the magical area that Slayers was in. I at least like that they give you the information little by little but sometimes it’s a little too late.,2004,119,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is Makoto Shinkai's follow up to his masterpiece 5 Centimetres Per Second and while it doesn't reach the emotional heights of that anime Children Who Chase Lost Voices is still a thrilling gorgeous orginal creative and highly entertaining adventure. The characters aren't really memorable or developed though and the fantasy setting does make me feel very emotionally alienated from what is happening (the complete oposite is true in 5CPS) and the film really outstays it's 2 hour running time with padded out scenes and pointless characters they introduce. But just sit back and soak in the visuals the amazing soundtrack and the higly creative word of Agartha.,2008,122,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Children Who Chase Lost Voices is a stunning visual theatrical experience by Makoto Shinkai himself in which i absolutely asdore his movies. From there you must wonder why then i rated this movie so low; well that is because it is a Makoto Shinkai movie. As stated while i was watching the movie Shinkai should not write movies for they make no sense (excluding 5 Centimeters Per Second). ,2012,126,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"This movie had a great setting and potential but it bit off too much. It was a slight disappointment compared Shinkais earlier stuff. It tries to be a Ghibli movie but it just can't get there even tho its visuals make Ghibli pale in comparison.

Pretty decent anime for a reverse harem theme Alot of hot bishounens :) so girls are going to love it. Entertaining action scenes the characters are the best part. They all have their own personality and very well drawn. The Main girl Isanami shes kind of annoying but not to bad. Their are other female characters in the anime my favorite was Ana. She reminded me of someone from Dead or Alive video game. Overall the anime is pretty decent to watch for 12 episodes. I have a feeling there is going to be a 2nd season just the way it ended. ,2016,130,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Why has this plotline taking a bunch of people and putting them in a survival situation gotten so cliche? Well it's because of stories like They Were Eleven. You have to remember this film was released in 1986 before this plotline became cliched. They really took the time to craft a complex melodrama featuring about five of the characters and the rest just fell by the wayside. Suspense and tension run very high here; it's worth watching once but once you know what happens it becomes boring.,2021,135,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of those so-awful-it's-epic kind of things. This 1986 science fiction anime retains that classic scifi feel with the same visuals and terminology that floated around back then. The two main characters Mitsuki Hayami and Captain Gatsby are both pretty epic in their own ways. The only reason for the plot lacking is because it's an old anime and you have to allow for the different generations. But since I have a soft spot for ancient terrible science fiction I love Cosmos Pink Shock and sincerely wish there'd been some more of it.,2032,146,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A while ago I heard about the series  Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro  with Takehito Koyasu one of my favourite seiyuu's voicing the main character. I told myself I had to watch this series even if it was bad - after all I was still able to fangirl about his voice. Now I've finished the anime I must admit it was actually really fun and enjoyable.,2036,150,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was interesting nicely done and I was surprised I liked it since I usually go for the romance genre. BUT I felt that Neuro and Yako were really compatible and sometimes I could have sworn that Neuro had special romantic feelings for Yako - and I just wish that the writers would've added that element in!!!,2037,151,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is supposed to be a sort of horror/comedy/detective show where a demon from hell decides to come to Earth to gain sustinance from solving mysteries. He immediately  befriends  (for a lack of better term) a human girl who's father had recently been murdered under mysterious circumstances.,2038,152,2019-04-13 21:35:40

At the time of writing this I'm still hopeful that the last installment of the three-part OVA will come out sometime this year though at this point I've kind of gotten tired of waiting and am beginning to direct my attention to other series on my waiting list. Even so I have good faith that when the 3rd episode does come out that it will be of similar if not better quality as the first two so as such I will go ahead and write out my thoughts on the first two episodes.,2047,161,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched both seasons of this anime and i like some of its charecters. But it didnt have a satisfying end and that really took it down for me. the comedy is good but there isnt alot of romance in this . i lliked that they changed the look of the anime this season its much bettter than the prequal . in my opnion its not worth watching. hachiman( the main protagonist)  is the only one carrying this anime . Dont watch this anime unless you want to waste time But there are much better anime that are more satisfying than this. ,2048,162,2019-04-13 21:35:40

My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO!,2051,165,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When it comes to anime people often get it right though they often get it wrong and this is one of those anime where they got it wrong. Sure it's very formulaic and the animation is barely OK but it's educational and not boring. Every episode starts off with the male lead introducing his sister who was away from him for 10 years because of family circumstances as the camera is focused on her. She then says something odd which you would have preferrred not to hear. A few things happen followed by an Osaka Tip saying  Osaka people do/think/like this  followed by his sister saying  that's how it is  then the next sketch happens the same way and the credits roll as his sister sings a crap song to the same tune as before then he gives out to her about it. Normally I wouldn't leave a review so short but the show itself is so short that there's not much to be said (so to speak) apart from I recommend it to people who want to move to Osaka or have nothing better to do than watch an OK anime but otherwise give it a miss.,2052,166,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story - This is the first season and Im guessing was meant to be an introduction to what was to come. The the greatest story as far as depth goes but I still enjoyed watching it. This was the first anime where I didn't want to watch the next episode just because I was scared for it to end. So I guess thats a good thing. The first season was pretty much just intro and the characters having fun. It didn't get serious until the last few episode. And I was shocked at the end. I didn't expect it to end that way. The romance was more cute then I usually go for but I liked it. Nothing bad but nothing really amazing but I enjoyed every minute of it.,2056,170,2019-04-13 21:35:40

YES!!! SO AWESOMEE!!!! LOVE IT! !! AND I THINK YOU WOULD TOO!! >< I LOVE THIS ANIME MORE THAN MY GIRLFRIEND!!! ARH!,2068,182,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First of all i know a lot of people thinks this shojo is great and recomemd it. I wanted to see it because everybody told me is an anime with a complete evolution of the relationship of a couple since highschool until they marry and had children. I found it really intresting and i thought it would be great so i started seeing. Girl likes boy and want to confess so she writte a letter and the boy without even knowing her name rejected her in the meanest way and when she try to get over him she ended up living with that boy and his family. The plot looks really promising and the only flaw i saw was thee boy cold and mean but i still watching after the first episode because the story looks promising and i thought he will fall in love with the heroine and change for good. Poor of me what a fool i was. The boy Naoki Irie is the worst hero in a shojo i've ever seen: he's mean rude cold and treat the heroine like she's a stupid showing any respect or care for her in a few moments on the show. Also the heroine Kotoko is made to look stupid with situations that must be comical but it just justify the horrible way she's treated by Naoiki and his is why i hate the most of the show. There's no development is just a girl and all the shit the douchebag she's in love with put her through to finally end up with him. The rest of the cast is equally obnoxious and supposed to be funny when they're not: the Naoiki's little brother is as annoying as his older brother and treats Kotoko worse their mother is a stalkerwho takes photos of Kotoko without her consent the kotoko's father is just...kotoko's father who doesn't defend her daughter when a boy humillate her in front of him and dream of the day they'll be together...the friends at the school are completely useless to the plot being minimal relevant a kotoko's male classmate who has a crush on her and is even more stupid than her.,2069,183,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: Ever since she first laid eyes on Naoki Irei Kotoko Aihara has been in love. But when Kotoko makes her move she is humiliated in front of other students and now everyone knows she was rejected. After all why would a handsome genius like Irei ever consider a ditzy girl at the bottom of her class. However when Kotoko and her father move in with Irei and his family they start to learn more about each other. Can they ever come to terms with each other? Will Irei ever notice Kotoko for anything other than a nuisance? Can thgey push past their differences and make it work?,2072,186,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Shoujo anime is not my favorite genre but I do enjoy it every now and then. Skip Beat for example is still one of my favorites (and I'm still waiting for the second season to it) and Full Moon wo Sagashite was also very heartwarming anime. Most of the time though Shoujo anime is the one genre that causes me most headache. Headache which is caused by a huge amount of facepalms.,2078,192,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It isn't often that I'm moved to review an anime but I feel that anyone who is considering watching Itazura na Kiss should be aware of a few things.,2082,196,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Itazura na kiss is a good anime a girl falling in love with a smart boy way beyond her level the story goes on how at last both of them will fall in love besides their differences it quite a awesome journey for both kotoko aihara and naoki irie watch theur up and downs... but compare to lovely complex is much more awesome and funnier..,2083,197,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"For me really a good story for firs time I come to see a long and complete history which isn't just enclosed in a single scenario but instead covers a lot of very good situtations in live. ",2084,198,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Personally Itazura no kiss speeded through the story just a bit too quickly it was at first very hard to get into thinking as though the anime would speed ahead I think myself that they should have made the anime a little longer and explained more of details in full depth it annoyed me that one minute i was whooping over the cuteness of the anime and then left dumb founded when i didn't understand what had happened like with the first false alarm pregnant scene i was left thinking  What the hell?  before it. ,2085,199,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was entertaining and for me did a good job provoking my emotions but I also think it was sort of ridiculous especially at first. I don't want to give any spoilers away but Kotoko's undying love for Irei despite his abusive actions towards her just seem so unrealistic that it made me a bit resentful of both characters Kotoko for being so prideless and Irei-kun for being just an a-hole. But that's my main criticism and as the anime progresses I enjoyed it much more as character's and their relationships continue to develop.,2086,200,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,2087,201,2019-04-13 21:35:40
  Itazura na kiss is one of my favorite animes ever made. I absolutely love everything about it. The story characters and most importantly the feeling of reality that it gives. The best thing about this romantic comedy is that the romance actually progresses unlike other romcoms. its somehow seems like its a complete story. Some animes at time leave that bitter taste of incomplete work but this one actually satisfies me. It's just amazing...,2088,202,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I almost dropped it after the 6th episode because it was so slow and cruel and nothing progressed in the story but I peekd in some other reviews and saw the pictures of the main characters kissing so I kept up my hopes and continued. It was absolutely good to do so because the story progressed but then it slowed down a bit again but it was  saved  again so at the end I enjoyed the whole thing pretty much.,2089,203,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of the few shows that really ends the way I would like to see it end.  It follows the characters all the way through to the end and I couldn't be happier.  If you're looking for a show that takes the plot beyond the point where so many other shows like it stop this is anime will become a favorite.  If I hadn't known that the show has 25 episodes I would've thought that it was going to end at episode 14.,2090,204,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Itazura no Kiss is a 25 episode romantic comedy anime of the shoujo genre since it’s aimed at young Japanese girls. Initially it seems very similar to the ‘okay’ Lovely Complex but it soon turns out to be an anime that all fans of romance can enjoy even those with a passing interest. One of the best romance anime I've seen It even goes where few anime dare: passage of time. My favourite romance anime of all time (Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien) had that mechanic and it returns here thus it can’t be terrible at least. But how good is it? Can it beat the likes of Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien? Are the characters as realistic or is there something else.,2091,205,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There is one other anime what I remember when I watched this anime. It’s Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann with only one difference. If previously named anime was about hope growth epicness Attack on Titan is exactly opposite. It is full of depression death and sadness. If there are any hope built it will be shattered in next episode.,2116,229,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched the show in its entirety twice once in dub the other in sub. The art is terrific. The concept of the is actually pretty brilliant when you start digging into the layers of the story.

The single coolest and maybe best moment is about episode 7 when the Rogue Titan first appears before Mikasa and takes down the Titan about to attack her and then he screams in anger and vengence.  The utter look of shock and surprise on her face match a sense of real emotions perfectly.  It solidifies the efforts to reallly bring you into the story.  All those years of facing Titans to see something so unexpected really play out in her carefully illustrated expressions.  One recurring theme that you never seem to shake off but gradually get a greater sense of is that the Titans are not the only enemies.  As is often the case in such epic animes there is a great deal of hidden enemies lurking below the surface.  The last scene shows you such a grand surprise it is reminiscient of Planet of the Apes when Heston sees Old Lady Liberty buried in the sand.  Then again part of the negative side is that there may well be too many hidden secrets in the series or more importantly that those secrets are dangled before the audience like a carrot before a hungry horse and we are never rewwarded.  Thus perhaps the biggest negative is just that they tease the viewers with promised forshadowing secrets but drag on revealing them so long that it risks losing the audiences' interest and earning their ire.  ,2119,232,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Alright Im not gonna make a review that will make you hungry for Potatos or Bread or whatever else but Here is my Review of Attack on Titan.,2120,233,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just want to save somebody's time like i would appriciate seeing a smiliar review myself before i started to watch this unoriginal cliche filled piece of  mature  wannabe crap. I know every story written and original piece of entertainment is in decline these days but it's also our fault for accepting cheap writing as normal these days. In absence of any good anime i took a chance with this anime thinking from the synopsis hey this doesn't sound so bad might as well look what is the fuss about. Fuck was i wrong. I dropped around at the 16 episode but the chance it became something else then those first 16 episodes is smaller then internet's memes and universal internet comment jokes become funny. where should i begin?? Let me start from the story.,2121,234,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is epic and is full of breathtaking action scenes. The story itself is also well developed and is paced quite well. The main character is generic and boring but the supporting characters make up for this as they are very interesting and add a lot to the story. The sound is amazing and really emphasises what is going on. Overall this anime is fantasitc. Anyone looking for high-tension intense fantasy anime should watch this.,2130,243,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a spoiler-free review.,2131,244,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I recently began watching this show and I've already finished it. THis is easily my favorite anime show i've seen. It's both humorous yet makes you want to cry. All of the characters are so interesting and easy to relate with. I recommend this show to anyone who loves adveterous and cliff-hanging stories. ,2132,245,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Several hundred years ago humans were nearly exterminated by Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall seem to have no intelligence devour human beings and worst of all seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls even taller than the biggest Titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city the two kids watch in horror as their mother is murdered and eaten. Eren vows that he will exterminate every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind. Nominated for the 4th Manga Taisho Awards (2011) and won the Kodansha Manga Award shōnen category (2011). In English the series is roughly translated to 'Attack on Titan'.</center><center></center></th> </tr></tbody></table>,2133,246,2019-04-13 21:35:40
    Attack on Titan starts off strong with it's superb opening song but sadly it falls off real fast the second it's over. The characters are shit the titan desigs in the anime are shit 3d maneuver gear is shit that titan in the wall cliff hanger is shit.

I used to be a happy scene-boy but after watching this anime everything changed. It's as if the fire nation had attacked. This anime was so terrible that I fell into a great depression and started cutting. Thank God Sleeping With Sirens and All Time Low released a new album because they're all I'm holding on to. P.S. I dropped it after 3 episodes.,2147,260,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I rated this anime perfect not because I'm a die-hard-fan of Levi heichou no not because of that but because I'm a fan of gore animes and this is one of the best animes I've ever watched. Also the animation is well-done especially their moves with the 3D manuever gear makes me want to own one. The characters are also well done. The author also had hidden meanings in some characters that goes beyond the story just like the character of Hanji I'm not going to tell what the author told about her/him XD Also the story is not the lovey-dovey type where boy protects girl actually it's kind of the other way around. KIND OF. The female charcters here are badass as hell. The plot of the story takes place in 500 BC where there were still Titans. Okay a little mythical but this anime is one of the badass anime there is. Try and watch it. This anime can make you cry cringe and tremble....with excitement. I LOVE GORES!!

attack on titan was possibly one of the best animes i will ever see in my life I perfer comedy anime over all others but attack on titan peaked my interest from episode one it has an amazing story and when any episode ends you are just stucking sitting in awe wondering how they could end and episode on something that makes you have to start a whole new episode......Its a hard show to get to sleep while your watching you just wanna stay up and find out what happens next its just a great show Watch it. I know you want to.,2150,262,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well the story and the world are interesting and I'm dying to know what this world is but the 8 or so hours of season 1 do little to explain it to me so all the yakking about what to do or not do and all the shouting about mistrust and honor not to mention endless fight scenes and grim deaths just annoyed me to have to sit through it.  So I'm compelled by my desire to resolve the mysteries but only get battles and strategy for 8 hours...  I will like the show better when my questions start getting answered until then there is much resentment for time wasted.  The characters and art are very good the Titans are super creepy and dreadful the animation relied on still shots in place of movement rather a lot.  I just wish anything had been explained to make me feel like season 1 was worth sitting through.,2154,266,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I came across Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin from a friend's recommendation.  I was with a group of friends and they were talking about it.  Curious I asked what they were talking about it and they just gave me a vague description.  My one friend just described it as just an action show and it was just crazy.  I followed my curiosity and began watching some of it with my cousin.,2158,270,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While trying to depict the feeling of hopelessness not many other anime re-create that feeling as strongly as Attack On Titan. Attack on Titan takes you to a world like that of blue gender where disturbing humanoid creatures would like nothing more than to eat your mother while your run away in a cliff hanger. At it's core Attack on Titan is a revenge story about becoming a monster to fight monsters. Unfortunately there isn't any natural progression towards this rage and there aren't many characters to feel empathetic towards. Most of the characters are either emotionless or unforgettably selfish. The characters that truly shine in the show are mostly side characters that either die or stop showing up altogether at a certain point. The humor in the show feels misplaced and takes away from the premise altogether. However even with all of it's flaws Attack on Titan is a fairly good show that will hopefully not be completely forgotten when next year's top anime pops up out of the hype train. toot toot.,2159,271,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Anime as great as Attack on Titan are very rare.  It's not everyday you find a story that completely draws you in making you feel like you're involved in this tragic tale.  It not only starts off with the anxious feeling that something bad is about to begin it lets that emotion hit you full-on throughout the entire series.  With a few jokes to lighten the mood this series perfectly pulls off dark comedy in an even darker setting.,2163,274,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I rate it ten out of ten because I truely love the story animation sound and characters! I really love the characters because there all very different and it shows there strugles to work as a team. I also love the plot because it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I also really injoy how much emotion it holds it made me cry laugh and scream all in the first season. So I will watching the second season for sure!,2166,277,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,2167,278,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I will first say I did love the animation and voice acting in this anime. In all honesty I would have given it a 10 out of 10 if it did not have such a Game of thrones feel where 90% of the characters you are introduced to die off. While yes the story line is good and there are many points that have you wondering whats next to me it seems pointless to build juch interesting characters and to actually flush many of them out all to go back and kill them in the next episode. It is my sole thought that this could ahve been much better and possibly gone on a few more seasons and become a larger scaled anime much like highschool of the dead. I do hope to see more of it though and would rank this up there as one I could watch again and again. Sorry thats all I can really say about it with out giving away the plot. The only other real complaint i  have is in later episodes when it seemed like they where religin to heavy on something they introduced. so those complaints aside its an all around good anime that will make you want to see mroe of it and has enough twists and turns that you will never be able to really predict what will come next.,2168,279,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2169,280,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Attack on Titan is undoubtedly a good anime. For my tastes it's not the greatest thing since sliced bread that most seem to think it is but it is good once it gets going. The world is certainly cool but somewhat nonsensical and the plot is so obvious. It also has it's dystopian future backwards things start really bad and gets worse then gets better then it hints that it's actually worse. The tone also goes all over the place. The ever present possibility of character death far from adding tension simply makes it harder to care about the characters. All that aside the fights are epic some of if not the best around. So give it a shot if you don't like the first couple of episodes stick with it the payoff is pretty good.,2170,281,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Peace finally has settled when a Titan destroys the wall and kills Eren's mother. Eren Mikasa and Armin join the corps in a quest to kill every Titan.,2174,285,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story: good focused storyline that follows the manga pretty closely. It draws you in with interesting premise and depth of mystery as well its political intrigue. However its major failure happens here as well. It does that cliche anime thing where the new episode overly recaps what happened in the prior episode and you always have that one character who explains what is acutally going on [often in their own head]. Its also a little over maudlin and angsty. The biggest problem of course emerges at the end of the series the manga keeps going well past the point where the anime ends so of course the anime ends with nothing answered and all of the myetery still on a cliffhanger and in fact a whole new mystery is literally revealed in the last few minutes. This shit of course drives me nuts.,2175,286,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I wasn't overly impressed with this anime. The story is original but OMG does it drag on and on. Not gonna lie but I felt like I was watching the freeza saga from dragonball z. The characters are pretty well written The animation I felt was really good.

Attack on Titan is a survival-action- fantasy anime. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the humans now face a very difficult situation for survival. It’s a pretty ok anime;Nothing too good or too bad. It’s just that the theme is new nothing like I've previously seen.,2198,305,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you're a fan of underdog stories gore and awsome fighting. Attack on Titan is a great anime to watch. A boy who starts out defensive and becomes the greatest option and survival tool for human life. Take note this anime can get to your mind pretty harshly as it has a form of cannablism in it. But overall this anime is great and has an awsome story line.,2203,310,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of the best shows I've seen recently. It was so good....and painfulllll. The pilot episode was fantastic. I was watching jaw-dropped and thinking holy shit they didn't waste any time. It wasn't boring for a minute. The first half of the series is so interesting and the last half is action packed. I was so happy that there were surprises around every corner and I was caught off guard and shocked about so many things (Which I love). The characters are brilliant especially Armin who I adore. It's bloody and violent and creepy...I just really enjoyed this one. The music and voice acting was superb and the animation was gorgeous. I want to watch it in 3-D really. I cannot wait for season 2...they ended the season well but you know there's a ton of shit they still have to explain. That last scene though...I just don't know what to think!!! Till then I'll just cry about what an epic adventure this season was.,2209,316,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hated it. was not fun to watch was a waste of time. never before had I watched such shit. Boku no piko is a million times better than this and we all know how bad boku nopico is. worst over rated piece of shit I have ever watched in my life.,2210,317,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay.. obviously just by my ratings its freaking fantastic awesome! Lol first story solid and plot twists every time at least the manga anime has barely started. Animation is just wow beautiful!! Music is spot on for every moment in theshow character development wonderful in my opinion really makes you feel terrified for them as they fight these titans. Overall I can't say just how simply amazing it really is go watch it! :)  this by far best anime this year seriously. Just wow!! Lol :),2211,318,2019-04-13 21:35:40
How can people not watch this master piece and witness one of the best animes of all time anyway this anime is amazing it ATTACK'S your heart and mind with amazing scenes and brilliant animations all episodes.The mystery in this anime is immensely formidable and even sherlock holmes can't probably solve what's inside the little room room that was pulverized by the titans.I am obsinate that this anime wll go a long way.,2212,319,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Shows like this don't come around often. Its been a while since an anime took over the world. I know many people who are not anime fans who enjoy Attack on Titan. I for one put off watching it for a while becuase I did not want to dissapoint myself with an over hyped anime. When I got around to watching it I just couldnt get enough of it. The animation is the halmark of modern anime and is a spectacle to see. ,2219,326,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well I bought into the hype. This show lives up to it.,2220,327,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow people seem to either hype the hate for this anime or worship every aspect of it. People chill. This anime doesn't deserve 100% of the love but it definitely isn't as bad as some people make it out to be.,2221,328,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The main character is a bit too sensitive very impatient has a bad attitude problem and not even showing tolenrancy in the slightest. Animation is okay but there is something that bothers me is that the characters have a white lining that covers the entire character which made me think its copy and pasted into the background. But overall it is a good anime with a nice storyline to it.,2222,329,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ok. My friends introduced this anime to me and I have heard many good reviews about it. Naturally I had to watch it. Let me begin by saying that I’ve only watched the anime so this review will only be on the anime and I will not cover anything past the anime.,2223,330,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Attack on titan is surpassing  tones of anime a month. Its manga was 2nd place in the most sold manga of the year and thats next to One piece. It will eventually get ahead of one piece which is ashame because i like one piece more. Its action scenes are amzing its dialog is intresting and its art style is new freaking awsome. It has in my mind already supassed death note. Thanks for reading like and follow and have a great day.,2224,331,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Attack on Titan is to descibe it in one word INTENSE. The story line and character development are perfectly paced and keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. The characters are loveable and the music and animation are flawless. Definetly one of the best animes I've seen to date. ,2236,343,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay I think the majority of us here can agree that Attack On Titan is one of the best anime series we've seen in recent years. Pretty much every aspect is bordering on perfect and this is why:,2238,345,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There was many animes that came along and none ever took the position of my number one favourite (Ah my Goddess!) that was until Attack on Titan. Here's why...,2244,349,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Attack on Titan is'nt just anime it is like a real story there will be intelligent practical battle plants and emotions that is combined with the classic anime style heroism and it also give greater importance to women potraying them as most powerfull on both warriors side and also on the opponents side. with the mind blowing music it is one unbelievable anime,2245,350,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Here is a anime that is amazing . The story plot was fast paced but not too fast  it kept things interesting at all times . Also the character devolpment was amazing  you never did know what the character was going to do next in a situation . There was only a couple things i didn't like . One of those things were that i think if memory serves correctly that there was 2 episodes that were just a flash back on some info that we already knew. But i did like the flash back that it showed when the two main character first met. And to the other thing i didn't like about the anime . The second op theme song. Personally I didn't care for it  it didn't really match the anime to me . I think it should have more upbeat to it like for an example Core Pride is a great op theme . But other than those things this anime is a must watch anime . I can't wait to watch the live action when it comes out>,2246,351,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Few animes are worth a perfect 10/10 and Attack on Titan is certainly one of them. The story line is full of action and suspense. However if you do not like gore this is not an anime for you. The animation is beautifully done from the landscape all the way down to the eyes of the characters. The soundtrack is also amazing. It's the kind of music that either gets you pumped up or makes your heart race. The characters were very well thought out and they all have aspects that make them memorable (not to mention many of them are good looking!). Overall this anime deserves a perfect score. While all shows have thier flaws I found very few in this particular series. Attack on Titan is one of those animes that have you hooked by episode 1. However if blood and violence are not your cup of tea I would avoid this anime. Otherwise I would definitely recomend this anime to others. ,2248,352,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story for this movie is minimal at best.  It's pretty straightforward and not really the focus of the move.  It provides the backdrop for the real meat of the movie: fighting and lots of it.  It's not gory since most of the on-screen deaths we see are either explosions or androids but there is a lot of violence.  The story doesn't even really conclude at the end!  If someone was looking for an interesting look at dystopian society and the nature of humanity they would have to keep looking as they won't find it here.,2249,353,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Once again they pull an episode from the series and instead list it as  Special  like the live house episode and it actually ends up being better than most of the episodes within the season. Pulling this one at least makes a little sense as it seems it was connected to the episodes they pulled for the movie but happened too far in advanced to add it to the film or else they'd have to jump a few months.,2251,355,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sin mucho cambio a la “temporada” anterior vuelve Gintama con sus últimos 13 episodios aireados en conjunto con otros 13 episodios que ya habían sido televisados anteriormente sumando 26 episodios pero eso fue allá en Japón yo solo vi los 13 originales. Y hay que decirlo pero es que si ya la temporada pasada había alcanzado puntos altos con sus arcos esta se lleva más laureles. Básicamente porque los 13 episodios no tienen desperdicio alguno mostrando 3 excelentísimos arcos siendo estos Kintama (Gintoki vs Kintoki) Ikkoku Keisei (Épico) y ojo con este arco que es uno de los más importantes que he visto pues trabaja con mucha historia de fondo y revela más datos tanto de la antigua guerra como del orden que está establecido actualmente en Edo; por ultimo Beam Saber hermosísimo arco sobre uno de los amigos de la infancia de Shinpachi y Otae en el cual nos encontraremos con un súper personaje como lo es Obi Hajime.,2254,358,2019-04-13 21:35:40

La primera emisión de Gintama termino un 25 de marzo del 2010 esto debido a que por aquél entonces el anime había alcanzado el manga durante ese tiempo pasaron repitiendo episodios viejos hasta que el 4 de abril del 2011 Gintama volvería con nuevos capítulos animados nuevamente de la mano de Sunrise.,2257,361,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The manga is better but watch the anime if you want to but read the manga first. I like the anime but its outlines and style really ruin it. I mean i'd recomend it to anyone who liked Attack on titas artstyle.,2258,362,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just finished watching all the episodes and I must say that it far surpassed my expectations.  I saw the old movies that were live action when I was a child and when I found this anime I had to check it out.  This anime is definitely meant for an older audience(16/17+) because of the violence swearing and gore found in this anime.,2259,363,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It is easy to see the connections between Eve no Jikan and this early work by Studio Rikka.  It is very similar in theme set and setting.  While it shows the potential that later Studio Rikka films have Mizu no Kotoba is still pretty rough around the edges.  Watch Eve no Jikan first if you like that then give this one a try.,2263,367,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Great movie you can watch this without having to see the first. The story and plot are kind of overrated some dude sees humanity as a waste of time and he wants to unify it into one consciousness eh however the means by which this is attempted do make the story a tad unique. It has a fair amount of situational comedy and great suspense as to the fates and destinies of each character. I'd recommend this to mecha and military genre fans.,2267,371,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime got a 10 from me but it takes some serious explaination.  So this will be long and in depth.  Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet  I hurt myself a couple times trying to say it at first.  This anime was pretty good.  so I was writing this while watching the last couple episodes and sh*t got so real that I had to change everything so here I go for the second time.,2280,382,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This will be more of a rant than a review but bare with me. The story went like this: Space war between space squids and human. Humans lose. Protagonist gets teleported to Earth that is now covered by sea. And basically this is the point when it starts being bad. It was so aimless and so empty I could literaly hear Nietche saying:  If you stare long enought into the abyss the abyss stares back at you.  We had no plot the characters didn't explore things like how life is on space and how different the cultures are they spent 2 out of thirteen episodes on fanservice (mind that it was omnipresent within the show). One episode was basically watching 3 mental 9 year olds belly dancing. And another eating meat. And that was it. We had pretencious philosophy in episode 3. It was like this:  You musn't kill the bloodthirsty raping pirates even tho you have pinpoint accuracy lasers. We respect life. So we must fire at them. But not you. Because that is wrong.  We had a lesbian pirate queen with boobs size of my head. Okay. So up untill it was aimless fanservice with out of nowhere unrelated attempts at talking about the value of life. They were literaly unrelated because we were watching a sci fi version of K-On. How does the value of life fit into moe fanservice? It doesn't. Now this isn't even the bad part! It was watchable at times because it was easy going and it had attempts at humor. At episode 10 _SPOILERS_ we find out that the space squid people are actually evolved human. How much foreshadowing did we get? Was there any indication that they are indeed intellegent beings? Of course not they acted as normal squids they used no tools they didn't have a society they didn't have any ways of comunication. They are animals. But okay. We see the protagonist think how evil he is how wrong it is and that he is a horrible human being. But all that happens in an instant he doesn't even try to find arguments for both sides he doesn't even try to define what a human is. Everything is just said and forgotten the ideas aren't thought upon they aren't explored or given a context. They are just thrown at us at a truly amazing rate. They bomb you with information and concepts and it actually makes some people say hey this is smart. It isn't. It is retarded. I mean imagine if Haibane Renmei was put into 3 episodes imagine if it's characters were one dimensional and it said that all humans have a soul and have to attone for their sins within themselves and ended it there. Gargantia also makes the humans from Earth seem like they are compleate morons. They actually start worshiping a mecha! Even though they have actual mechas! Would you start worshiping iPhone 30 if you suddenly saw it? Would you throw away your will and your self and change the entire culture? No? Didn't think so. _SPOILERS_,2281,383,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Gargantia’s opening fight sequence in space is dazzling - despite lack of investment as we have only just met our archetypical characters – unfortunately the animation goes downhill from there and our investment grows only slightly.,2282,384,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"What is worse a show that aims high and fail or a show that doesn’t and succeed. Personally I think the latter is more acceptable. I feel this way since a show doesn’t aim high doesn’t give me false expectations. Shows that do aim high but fail to deliver just leave me angry and frustrated such in the case with Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet. ",2285,387,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The main character Akira is falsely accused of commiting murder. The reason? Because someone wants him to play in a life or death game called Igura. He ends up in a place called Toshima a lawless city made up of other players and a few other nonplayers. The game rules are simple. It's like playing poker only the stakes are much higher. The player recieves several tags each representing a playing card. They have to wear one that is always visible or they can be executed. The goal is to challenge II Re aka Shiki and be in charge of drug line making you one of the most powerful people but in order to do that you have to take cards from other players by fighting them and winning. There must be witnesses and no cowardly attacks are allowed. The opponent doesn't have to be dead but that's usually how they end up. If a player breaks any rules people called executioners will come after you and kill you. The executioners are like cops sort of for the game. The city doesn't actually have any cops or hospitals. ,2309,408,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First of all I would like to point out my surprise at the excessive negative feedback this anime has received. I'm going to assume the quality did not reach the high expectations of the manga readers but I can't find a valid reason for the anime-only viewers.,2310,409,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2311,410,2019-04-13 21:35:40
first thing: this anime is  boys love  environment. There is only like one woman that is super hot and you only see her two times basically. Just saying that there is some gayish appeal to this anime. Not enough to turn you away but if you dont like that type of thing then i wouldnt watch this anime. I was able to bear it. It was just kind of annoying at times. It may be that you enjoy that type of thing in which case this would be a good anime for you.,2312,411,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A beautiful story that's just as inspiring as the rest of Hayao Miyazaki's films. I'll admit that this movie made me cry. Not because it was sad but because it filled me with so much emotion giving me all sorts of ideas and inspirations. I'm almost sure that anyone who likes Hayao Miyazaki will love this film. Memorable characters amazing storyline and it even brings in the Baron and Muta from The Cat Returns. I have seen almost all of Hayao Miyazaki's films but this one is by far my favorite that I know I will love and find all sorts of inspiration in for years to com.,2325,422,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The only thing that I can really say about this is that it is strange in a bad way. It seems like something that a group of art students made that were trying to make some sort of deep profound message about humanity or society or something of that nature.

Kurokami an Anime that promised a lot It's good but here I'll post my honest opinion after checking the manga.,2339,436,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"The drawn style of this isn't as sharp and colorful as newer animes. It may  add to the anime's darker theme but tints of one color in anime can be annoying. The storyline is very straight forward. The characters don't seem too interesting and the plot seems cliche. It trys to hard to be a drama and the action fighting scenes are exaggerated. ",2340,437,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2341,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Way to throw a potentially good premise out the window I say. The first episode is absolutely one of the best with solid introductions and an interesting undertone. The badassery is gone by the time you reach episode 2. It then just diverges into pointless nonsense and the lead character gets tedious to listen to and/or watch. Well there isn't much more to say about this anime other than you see annoying characters you'll never see again.,2342,439,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've found this anime because it was recommended on this site foreople who like Shakugan no Shana. After watching the first episodet left me with the same feeling - disliking the world scheme used inhe anime but still liking the anime itself. Humans in Kurokami allave 2 identic looking doppelgangers sharing an finite amount ofuck if they meet only one of them will survive. (what the heck...),2343,440,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A great intro to an amazing series and character. Monkey punch always had it right with this one. Can someone tell me though why the date says 1989 on AP but all websites say this is the plot episode that started it all in 1969. Someone please enlightenment me if I am wrong.andabeard!,2345,442,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,2346,443,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a futuristic Korean Anime. Its set in a distopian future where the upper (ruling) class has no regard for the  diggers  (the lower class). The diggers keep the  living city  functioning but live in total poverty. The rest of the earth is a wasteland.,2348,444,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ok this anime I couldn't take as high regards to anyone such as a female or male who might get arose about the closely non sex inappropriate parts that you can't see but do feel like it. Although people who love brother and sister complex be my guess but through even the slightest I've couldn't take what this anime was giving to me. I'm fine with ecchi but way out of the zone I would go so far to watch this anime and the even though this anime made it made sense for me to stop and this why I get its a three star.,2349,445,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a lot better than the first OVA which was good but this was just far better. And again this is NOT hentai! NO EXPLICIT SEX is shown. Anyways I really liked that they put a lot more into the story this time getting the other characters more involved. The animation's the same as the previous. Sound is a little more refined. And the characters are a step up obviously with the exception of Sora who I hate. I'm not sure how he's had all this sex since the last OVA ended but is still crying like a little b*tch getting raped whenever he talks to a girl or is having sex with one. They need to make another OVA where a ninja assassin comes and ACTUALLY rapes him then paints the room with his blood.,2351,447,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a cute OVA and considering how much they had to rush in a limited time slot it isn't that bad. However I regret watching this without reading the manga because I feel that would go into a lot more description rather than trying to explain everything really fast. ,2354,450,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Arve Rezzle: Kikaijikake no Yoseitachi is set in 2022 where technology has advanced enough to allow humans' minds to travel through cyberspace as they leave their bodies behind in  body pools  which would maintain their physical health. This new technology is called NLN. A crisis later dubbed as  Early Rapture  occurred and several thousand consciousnesses were lost in cyberspace unable to return to their bodies. Remu's sister Shiki was one of the victims of this incident but she managed to return. However the one who returned to Shiki's body wasn't  Shiki.  Somehow a different soul wandered into her empty body and took over. Together Remu and  Shiki  head out to discover the cause of this incident how to get Shiki's soul back and whether or not they can find  Shiki's  body.,2356,452,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Dragon Ball Z concluyo en 1996 excluyendo claro la bastardeada que realizo Toei hacia la obra de Akira Toriyama la cual lleva por nombre Dragon Ball GT. Pero bueno dejando eso por fuera para todo fan de la saga con la que probablemente se crio era una alegría enorme ver que 18 años después se confirmaba una nueva película de DB ubicándose esta al termino del arco de Majin Buu y dejando en el olvido GT.,2372,467,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I highly recommend this movie for all DB and DBZ fans. After such a long time watching this movie made me feel like I was a child again in a good way. I lost myself in the compelling storyline; and as always there's more than enough humour to ease the tension. A little heads up: This takes place after the events in Dragonball Z not GT as GT is not canon (most people know but it's better safe than sorry). So for all you GT fans *MINI-SPOILER* don't expect Pan or grown up Trunks/Goten. But do expect to have a lot of fun watching this movie.,2373,468,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The animation and sound were top notch! As for the rest...well...,2374,469,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well where shall I start. It was a good movie indeed but it didn't seem fullfilling because if you think about a naruto movie you would see a lot more interesting bits of fighting and suspense. But that was just like.... Ok Bills is coming he wants to destroy the world if he doesn't see a super saiyin god and you need 6 saiyins to make it work ich include GohanVegetaGotenTrunks Goku and Videl's baby (since she is pregnant) So goku turns into super saiyin god and fights Bills but after that Bills gets tired and decides to destroy earth another time.

I love the animation of this anime. The story is about finding your own identity instead of living your parent's dreams. Caroline (nickname) is one day spotted on the street and requested to model for a fine arts high school fashion show this then leads her to the designer workshop which is called the atelier. This leads to a mix of emotions to suddenly run through her brain should she be the perfect studious girl or the new beautiful model. And who does she love? Will she and George become an item? It was good except the ending made me sad... But it also is more realistic that way I guess.,2391,485,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I started watching this anime because one off my friends (a boxer) told me it was fun and addicting to watch. I didn't think much about it at the time. When i started watching i noticed my friend was right...The story is great and starts with a mere  weakling  who starts to work himself up in the boxing ring. The scenes are sometimes very intense and that is what is so great about this anime. I lost to this anime and i watched all episodes in 2 days. If you like sports or not you should definitly check out this anime because next to the intense battles there is also a comedy side to this anime which is very much entertaining.,2402,495,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Let's get one thing out of the way right now: I am a fan of this show.  The term  fan  is thrown around a lot these days.  People seem to forget that it is short for  fanatic .  So I am careful about calling myself a fan of any one series.  I truly love this show with a passion but I do recognize it's faults.  Let's take a look:,2404,497,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well i think im going to start this review off my saying this . Normally i would not touch anime with a sports related theme  cause personally i really don't care for sports . What drawn me to this anime was the clip that i watched on youtube giving it a review . So i decided to watch it and i instantly was addicted to it . The story line was great mixing in Comedy  Action  a little bit of school life  Romance . I think what made me so attached to this anime was that i could see myself in Ippo shoe's  being also one that was bullied  but never giving up on his dream . This anime is inspiring to the max . You get so emotional attached to the characters that when a fight happens you are yelling at your screen  well for me it did  and im sure it will for you too . The animation style was a little old school for me  but it still looked great . The sounds from the matches to the voice actors was supreb . I would not change one thing about it  the puches would actually sound like punches and the the speeding of the dash took your breath away . Over all this anime was amazing  even if you are not into sports  you will still fall in love with this anime . I know that i did  And I hope you will too .,2406,499,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Very entertaining anime about boxing. The story pulls you in and keeps you interested throughout the entire series and leaves you wanting more. The characters are all very interesting and well fleshed out.,2407,500,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't think anyone enjoys seeing two men in a ring  beating each other to pulp and sweating the heck out  neither I do because it's dumb and rather boring but this show made it like you'll highly enjoy boxing battles and there will be cases  where you'll even end up loving opponents.,2413,506,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For me this anime was one of the best i have ever seen. It was colourful fun different and a joy to watch. Now i'm not a fan of Sci-fi normally but this anime hooked me from the vey beinining with its werid and colourful world so i didnt really care about the sci-fi aspects. It  has great charaters and a fun plot he messages of the anime is quite nice to. ,2416,509,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The only thing that I can't complain about is the art style and animation which is very nice and goes nice with the setting. the first part of the series is when the main protaginist Haru gets with a black haired girl whos name I have forgotten (sorry :3) in around two episodes they are on procreating level and as soon as they give you a shot of the genitals BOOM.,2441,532,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really liked this anime. It's a bid perfisch bud also really kawaii. The storry is a bit basic bud that doesn't really mather. This Anime is aboud twins who transfer to a coutryside town. The guy (haruka) becomes friends with the people in town. But he REALLY kazuha the most. His sister (sora) is a bit a depressed person and isn't really a lot in the picture. There's al lot of hot romance en a litle twist in the story. Just watch it ;). The Story is al about the different relations with al the different girls. And every girl has her own storry.,2443,534,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overall the series is very addicting. A little perverse and for the most part is unnecessary.  Characters were fairly well built and realism is kept within a certain check.  Nothing to special about the animation style.,2460,551,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I rather like this anime. In my opinion it's one of the more appealing shounen genre shows out there at the moment - although the fights are gratuitous (as dictated by the genre) the girls are annoying and some of the character voices make me want to put my head through a wall I can't really help but like it. The reason? I am fascinated by the youkai and by all the cultural stuff in general. And after looking at the Supreme Commander's head shape is that what Rikuo's head looks like under the hair? I hope so - finally an anime character that has an excuse to have a ridiculous hairstyle!,2463,554,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There are alot of ways this series at least attempts to differentiate from the standard anime cliches.  Sure the main character is 12 years old but they work around this by giving him a form he changes into which appears to be anywhere from 17 to 28 or so.  Sure it takes place in part at a school but much of the story drifts away from it to involve clashes with other monsters.  It has parts at school but it doesn't focus on it exclusively.  Many of the monsters look like cheap teletubby rip offs but some look decently cool as monsters should with strong abilities.  One slight miss however is between this and the second season he does not seem to remember he has the power he develops by the first season's end.  I find that abit puzzling and similar to Fairy Tail (which is a great show but it has a serious rinse and repeat problem where each group of new enemies renders all the power they gained from the prior clash useless as if they never had power and gives them no where to go but back down since they get great power then seem to give it up over and over again.)  Well this one appears to have a little of that though in a far more subtle way.  ,2464,555,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is all about Yokai's and Demons. Its an interesting anime where the story keeps us watching. The characters in this story is quite wierd but yet nice to see. There are many fighting and flirting episode's in it. So i recommend to those who like monsters and yokai =),2466,557,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have seriously no idea why anyone would like this series.

Personally I find baseball by and large to be incredebly boring. This leads me to steer clear of baseball anime but in this case I heard taht this is more of a  management  series than a baseball one persay. Also the idea that they were releasing an episode a day (although being during finals time thus making it impossible for me to keep up) was very intriguing.

For some strange reason I didn't expect it to be all... chesty racked with fanservice and stacked with boobs. I should have because that's the first thing you think of when someone says hotsprings or onsen. Instead it's just cute girls trying to get a hotspring for cats getting the temperature just right. That's it. I'm thinking it's meant to portray a small storyline for a happy-go-lucky manga that doesn't take itself seriously concerning the lives of a group of girls and a guy (No harem) who run a hotsprings inn and it's made me mildly curious about the series. It's cute and for 6 minutes it could be far worse. And leaving it I feel mostly indifferent same as when I came in.,2486,574,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Darker Than Black is a good show full of cliffhangers. When I watched this I had been out of the wholearathon-rhythm for a while but I was still able to finish this in two daysince I was constantly looking forward to the next episode.,2493,581,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A giant wall known as Hell's Gate surrounds Tokyo and people with superpowers known as contractors roam the city fighting not only each other but police as well as other government agencies.  With one contractor being feared more than all the rest even among other contractors and that contractor is the series protagonist BK-201 Hei also known as The Black Reaper who's main job is to fight and defeat other contractors while looking for his sister.  That pretty much sums up Darker Than Black in a nutshell.  The series is laid out to be mainly comprised of several episode long mini-arcs that tend to focus on one particular character of the series.  That tends to weave in a overall larger plot within the arcs that serve to actually give the series purpose instead of just being a collection of mini-arcs.  Darker Than Black tends to give off a very dark feel to it which the series for the most part sticks with until the end.  But that doens't do its best to add some comedy and romance to the mix inorder the keep the interesting to which it does a fairly decent job of.  The series is overall is a great watch that should have just about something for anyone to stay interested in and want to watch.,2494,582,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Darker than Black is by all respects a good anime.  Characters are likeable and strong although there seems to be quite a few of them which seems to make it a little confusing.  However the important ones are always around so they become deeper and more interesting as time goes on.  The story is deep but the story arcs go in two-episode bursts and they can feel a little typical.  However it does seem to have more twists in it than many of the other stories that are similar.  Animation is pretty and they have added ina little bit of 3D animation.  It makes it look pretty.  Sound is not bad.  Voice acting is great but sometimes the effects feel like they are lacking.  The saving grace for the sound is the music.  The opening/closing songs are good and the soundtrack adds a lot to the overall dark feeling of the show.,2499,586,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Darker than Black with character designs from Iwahara Yuji is a seinen series and you better keep it in mind when you watch it. If you're looking for light moe scenes you won't find it here. It is a serious serious with a deep tone but that's the series highlight and what the series does best.,2503,589,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Absolutely loved it.  :D  The flow of the animation is total eye candy - seriously it's remarkably pretty the soundtrack is beautiful and the characters mysterious and interesting.  The only thing keeping it from a full score is that the story although intriguing and clever left quite a few questions unanswered.  I hoped these would be further explored in the second season but so far (I'm a couple of episodes into season 2) I'm disappointed by the lackluster animation (Hei in particular doesn't quite look like himself anymore) and blatant fanservice (panty shots and boob-focus?  Really?  Ugh.).  :/ ,2505,590,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I seriously don't get the hype about this anime. Yep Hei is kind of cool some nice action scenes but else...? There's really nothing DTB is brilliant at. If I want action I'd rather go see Cowboy Bebop if superpowers and fun I'd see Get Backers. Dunno overall it's good but I guess I expected much more from this classic.,2508,593,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime was poor at best and is the first anime I have ever dropped which is an issue. I made a point of never dropping animes but I could no longer continue with this. The storyline which is extremely jagged and hard to follow revolves around a young man named Hei who has moved to Japan. He is a contractor which is a person with special abilities. These abilities were gained after the appearance of the  Hell's Gate . The pacing of the story is very slow as the creators wasted their time with pointless filler stories. The actual main story is so hard to follow due to the presence of all these side stories and it doesn't come together until near the end of the series! Overall whilst the Tory is unique and can appeal to many it just didn't do it for me.,2515,599,2019-04-13 21:35:40

No Im not! Anime sometimes just creates what I like to call  perfect characters  and Hei is definitely in this category. I feel that the greatness of this show is rivalled by only my top 10ers. A fake sky full of fake stars a world were contracters exist souless calculating beings who will use there power to achieve their goals. Heavens gate was destroyed 10 years ago will the same thing happen at Hells gate? Don't follow what im saying? then watch it I give it two thumbs.,2517,601,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Darker Than Black AKA Kuro no Keiyakusha is a 26 episode action sci-fi anime featuring unique superpowers wielded by beings known as ‘contractors’. It reminded me a lot of western comic-book fiction like Batman and X-Men. But it still remains unique and has a plot with mystery in addition to a varied cast of characters to make it stand out. A friend recommended this anime to me and told me I’d enjoy it when he saw it in my collection and it seems other folks also seem to think the same way too. But does this anime live up to its hype.,2520,603,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Overall... an 8. I enjoyed the story. I liked how the main character was good with electricity. I can't remember his name. I also like the monotone white hair girl. She seems to show up in many anime. Good flick. Entertaining. I was bummed that it got over the way that it did. I was hoping for a different direction in the ending.,2523,606,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This has got to be one of the saddest excuses for an anime I've ever seen in my entire life that I literally bite my tongue for calling it an anime. Sadly though and here is a bit of akn known fact about me once I start a show I do everything in my power to watch the whole thing first before judging. *takes deep breathe* First let me get this out the way... if something like I don't know busty women with a storyline that doesn't even make any sort of sense is written down on paper it should be shredded immediately then bang your head 20 times on a marble table while promising yourself to never make crap like this into anything more than a mere dream gone bad. *Phew* Now that that's out of my system lets get to the actual review shall we.,2528,611,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Working!! is a slice of life comedyased on the manga in 4 panel style by Karino Takatsu that takeslace in a restaurant in Hokkaidō. Something I usually refer to as an animeitcom. Takanashi is an average high school boy who is given theroposition of working at a restaurant by his senpai Taneshima whoooks to be about 12 but is actually older than he is and refers toim as Katanashi (he only lets her call him this). He accepts theroposal based on his adoration of small cute things. He's notolicon he just likes small cute things... but the subject matteroes get confused leading to some comedic moments. Upon starting hishift he meets the androphobic Inami who can hardly resist hittingen in fear of them; Kyōko Shirafuji the bad ass manager with aeart of gold (kinda) and big appetite; Yachiyo a sweetheart girlho idolizes Kyouko... oh and carries around a katana with herverywhere. Along with Satō the cook (who reminds me of a certainirate cook with similar hair) The easy going Sōma the other cooknd General manager Otō who lost his wife (no really she went outhopping and got lost) you've got a full house... er restaurant ofomedic fun.,2539,622,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Coming off of A's the next season of Nanoha had some pretty big expectations to fill and they tried to do it with 26 episodes instead of 13. They also seemed to have the goal of really expanding the Nanoha universe fleshing out world details and in this vein I think they succeeded. There were a few flaws in this stylistic change though and I'll get to them below.,2542,625,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Ten years after thevents in seasons one and two Nanoha Fate and Hayate have formed a specialnit for rescue and investigation and are involved in the training of severalalented young mages.

I had seen the original Vampire Hunter D a few years back and to be honest I was not really impressed with it. I found that it lacked the suspense and excitement I was looking forward to and the characterization left something to be desired. Fortunately Bloodlust does manage to surpass its predecessor -- not only with its superior visuals but also with its enhanced storytelling and character development. Bloodlust is mainly about the kidnapping of a young woman named Charlotte Elbourne. However D and the Marcus Brothers soon discover that Charlotte's not really a kidnap victim -- because she's actually in love with Meier Link! Is she under a spell? Or do Charlotte and Meier truly have feelings for each other? Meanwhile D saves the Marcus Brothers' female member Leila from certain death and an unlikely bond forms between them. What starts out as a vampire-hunting adventure soon turns into a Dracula-esque romantic drama... albeit I'm not complaining. Bloodlust is not a conventional let's-slay-the-bad-vampire story that its predecessor was and this time we are given more insight on what drives the main characters. I must say though that D's talking hand is still the irritating chatterbox that it was in the original movie -- incessantly stating the obvious throwing in side comments that are neither smart nor funny... just useless and silly. With regards to the visual aspect Bloodlust is incredible. Character designs backgrounds and movements are exceptionally smooth polished and detailed. The animated sequences are done so skillfully that even ordinary actions like running or walking around present an awe-inspiring spectacle. There's also a lot of no-holds-barred fighting action blood and gore. I was pleased to discover that one of my favorite Do-As-Infinity songs is Bloodlust's main theme. The English dubbing is excellent. There were no mispronunciations since all the characters had more or less western names and the voices suited the characters perfectly. All in all Bloodlust is a solid movie and a vast improvement over the original Vampire Hunter D. You can even watch it without any Vampire Hunter D background because the story stands on its own and is totally unrelated to the first movie.,2548,631,2019-04-13 21:35:40

And the Harima clinched her though she doesnt care a bit of him.  ,2553,636,2019-04-13 21:35:40

【こばと。・ Kobato.】,2568,651,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After watching this I feel like this anime is really under-rated. It has never been on any list of recommendations for shoujo anime that I have seen before so it isn't something I would choose straightaway. The only reason I watched it was because it came up when I typed in shoujo in the search bar! And I am very happy that I decided to give it a try. This is definitely one of the best anime I have seen!!,2569,652,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Quite possibky the best hidden gem ive seen in ages. since watching clannad ive been waiting for something similar to pop up. Kobato simply said is amazing. it has that nice warm hearted anime but its those absolute magical moments that complete this anime.,2570,653,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For most of the show it was just okay. Nothing really big happened mostf the time. It totally changed during the last two episodes. Wow! Ihought those two episodes nearly made up for the rest of the show. Itas really touching and was a little teary-eyed. I was a littleisappointed though but that's a spoiler.,2571,654,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've started watching this anime recently (I'm on episode 8) and I love it and everything but: I wish they'd explain more as to where Kobato comes from. Also I hate the way Fujimoto treats Kobato. His backstory made NO SENSE. I didn't understand one bit of it! Why is Fujimoto such an ass? Seriously explain it! ,2573,656,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Watching Kaiji is one of the most chokingly powerful shows out there. The tension is high while watching Kaiji pull his way through the many death games laid out before him. The show's premise is so heated that you will literally feel incredibly stressed out just by watching it. The death games are smart and ingreuging as they are dangerous. Just by watching the show you will come to the realization that one false step for our progagonist will lead to a never ending fight of pain and misery. There isn't anything more gripping than that. Safe to say that after finishing Kaiji you will be able to enjoy your freedoms more thankfully.,2575,658,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mawaru Penguin Drum is the real deal. It starts off innocently enough and it was hard to grit my teeth and get past the first few episodes. It adds layers of silliness depth darkness humor and complexity so gradually that by the time you reach the middle of the series the outlandishness of the premise isn't even noticeable. So very rarely does something manage to pull of a descent into dark surrealism as well as this show. What starts as an off-beat piece of humor becomes an introspective delve into the human psyche... and manages to do so without monologs and forced scenes.,2584,667,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Im new to the series but my first impression of the anime was Silent Hill on a much smaller scale and it lived up to that.  The writer shows no favoritisom as he even kills off key characters which in my opinion is the way all anime should be it makes for a more believable story.  If your looking for a good story with amazing character development and a quick scare this is perfect.,2599,681,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is not so much 'scary' as it is gory and relying on excessivly gory and bloody images. So if gore and blood is what you're looking for go ahead and watch this. But if you're looking to be scared either by atmosphere or right out jump-scares look elsewhere. It does get creepy though. And there's a weird amount of panty-shots.,2603,685,2019-04-13 21:35:40

very bloody. it showed very sensitive footage. but who cares. it was cool. not really scary in my opinion,2606,688,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not going to lie this is a pretty messed up anime though I did watch the entire thing so not sure what that says about me. It's not really what I would consider scary though for an anime it is pretty gory and graphic. The story line is pretty solid and I have to admit it was fairly interesting. It's kind of hard to grasp the characters and their personality however as some of them are really only seen for a short time and I think perhaps this is something that could have been developed. In all honesty there were a few cliche horror moves made by the characters that are central to the story and I was left questioning the characters intelligence more than once throughout the four episodes but it wasn't terrible.,2607,689,2019-04-13 21:35:40
DISCLAIMER: I have never played the original game but I have watched a LP of it.,2608,690,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you have played the game this anime is adapted from then you'll notice a ton of differences. They are mainly who dies and how they die. I wish it would have been longer so it could have gone more in-depth at some points like in the game but I thought it did a good job of condensing an almost three hour game into four episodes. It's not scary in the sense of jumpscares but it is very creepy and atmospheric. It does get rather gorey so i don't suggest watching it if you are not comfortable with gore or heavy violenece.   ,2609,691,2019-04-13 21:35:40
i found this anime quite interesting to watch but rather confused at the end when they are both holding the guys arms. is it because he had two pieces? it's my question to know why he didn't make it. oh well. i enjoyed this gory anime. the story was good but its not original as ive watched animes that is similar.,2610,692,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Rules of a survival horror:,2611,693,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you have watched any horror/mystery series or movies in your life there is a high chance that you will find this anime quite boring. The plot was predictable characters were flat and the setting didn't offer anything new. I wonder if more episodes had been able to save this anime since 4 OVAs didn't leave any room for character development. All in all I felt that this anime had little to offer unless seeing kids die in a high school makes you happy. ,2612,694,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is the perfect anime for the halloween/fall season. With only four episodes this anime is the perfect substituion for one hour and a half scary movie. Becoming more of a gory mystery series rather than a horror anime there are still enough chilling and suspenseful to keep you on the edge of your seat. I reccomend this to anyone looking to add to their list of the scary/unsettling genre. Plus that ending will just leaving you with the most bone chilling feeling ever!

Corpse Party: Tortured Souls an OVA series people who haven't played the original game like;  Whoa! That was so GOOD 10/10 OVA of the year 2012-FURUVUR!  than the people who DID play the original VN were like  NUUU IT SHOULDN'T GO LIKE DAT!  (although as far as I know there are multiple endings) Well I haven't played the original VN ever and I do plan on it but this was one of those anime that I have been told over and over to watch. And so I did. I love japanese horror you should never give the horror genre to America because than Michael Bay will make a horror movie out of a fake Hasbro product. Japan really knows how to creep people out. Does it live up to expectations?,2616,698,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was terrifying !!!!!!!!!! One of my favorite anime reviewers watched it and gave it a review and warned his followers not to watch it and my curiosity got the best of me and I watched .... I have to say it is absolutely awful. So much gore. I was too scared to get attached to the characters or like the music. I suggest you play the game or watch a BETTER anime this is a waste of time. ,2617,699,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Naruto is one of the most watched anime series out there and a pretty interesting topic. It has everything: comedy tragedy romance. How good is it? Now heres the problem. When the writer wanted to make something good he did it but when he just wrote is for the money we get a shitload of almost unwatchable fillers. I dont really want to talk about the story or anything we all know it pretty well even people who dont watch it.,2626,708,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The best thing this anime has going for it is the lessons and the morals and how they're shown threw the characters. The characters are not generic but unique and stay true to who they are. *The character score is actually supposed to be 11/10 because i've never loved and felt so close to anime characters ever.*,2627,709,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"I am not a huge fan of shounen animes but this one really touched my heart.  Naruto is such an interesting character and it makes you root for him because he tries so hard.  Its an exciting anime to watch with a lot of action and adventure.  Barely any romance.. but for this anime thats okay with me!  I like the story line because everyone has such neat shinobi powers and its interesting to see them duel.  ",2628,710,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime has a very good story line to it. I like that it mostly follows one main story to it. But I don't like that there are a lot of filler epsiodes in it. The animation of the anime is very good. I like the details in the characters and the scenary. I like most of the music in the anime because it is very good. I also like the sound of some of the characters voices. The characters of the anime are very good and well developed. So over all this is a very good.,2633,715,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A wonderful manga and anime truelly inspireing the characters are all unique and the story is incredibly imaginative it must be after all for lasting so long. The twists and turns mixed in with fights and emotional conflicts this is much more than fighting and much more han love stories this is real drama unrealistic world but with realistic characters I don't know how to describe how amazing this is THUMBS UP!!,2641,723,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Untill about 100 episodes i liked it but AFTER it it was absolute waste of time. I watched 250 episodes of this series. Its dumb and navie piece of crap. Worst anime ever. It's plot at some point totaly looses sens. Watching some episodes your not sure if you didnt skip something. I regret ever starting to watch this shit.,2642,724,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really liked the anime espacially the sound ^^ The storyline is also ok but i think that the last 20 episodes of Naruto kinda failed. It had nothing to do with the original storyline. But besides the fact that it had nothing to do with the storyline they are not too bad. but it's because of this fact i think they failed. But in overall i think Naruto is awesome and watching the shippuden series atm ^^ everybody should do that :Preetshapowner,2648,729,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2649,730,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was the first anime that really got me hooked the animation was great for when it came out but the shippuden series is much better the overall story line is good with a great cliff hanger to keep you watching thru to the shippuden series but overall has way to many fillers,2651,732,2019-04-13 21:35:40

DBZ had ended on Cartoon Network's Toonami block and Dragonball GT was already about to end so Toonami needed another big shonen anime hit to fill in that void. They picked up Naruto to be airing in late 2005 the anime based off of Masashi Kishimoto's hit manga and it was a smash hit on Toonami. Tons of merchandise was made and even I was a huge fan of it growing up. It was one of my favorite shows and I even bought the merchandise including Naruto Collection 2 and a bunch of the games for GameCube and GameBoy Advance. Nowadays Naruto is viewed as one of the most well known anime in the States not to mention it is still a huge hit in Japan.,2655,736,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've watched Naruto possibly 9-10 times over this is my favourite anime of all time I became attached to Naruto Uzumaki at the very beginning though there were some times he was annoying but i liked him because he made me a stronger person.,2657,738,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was the anime that shot off the new era of anime. A story of a kid who was mad an outcast growing up by his village for something that he couldn't control. Naruto is a character that several of us can relate to having felt lonely at some point in our life. Working his way up to make friends and achieve recognition with hopes of becoming the leader of his village. Naruto comes up agianst several interesting friends and foes throughout his missions. Naruto's story is a moving and action packed story combined into one. This is a show that should be seen by anybody that loves their anime. ,2658,739,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ahhh naruto My very first anime series. It took me just a simple scene where naruto does the Harem no jutsu and Ebisu has an epic nosebleed from ep. 2 for me to be hooked on it. I've definitley heard of the show a long time ago but I wasn't interested until one saturday night toonami came on and my sister FORCED me to watch it. *bows down* THANK YOU SO MUCH SIS!!!!! This anime in my opinion really deserves the hype. Lets start with the story line can you say genius? I mean come on! The whole ninja theme with a trouble making kid with the name of a common fishcake aiming to be hokage but with his 9 tails spirit he goes through tough obstacles to reach that goal/dream. I love that storyline because it's simple understandable and it doesn't change no matter what. Now the ninja theme omg kunai shuriken seals scrolls thumb biting fish net outfits I mean it doesn't stop I use to think I was a ninja from naruto that an control gravity xD haha no lie. I love how each supporting character has their own abilities like Shikamaru with Kagemane no justu (shadow possesion)  Shino with his kikaichu (chakra eating beetles *0*) and Rock Lee (my fav) with his bone crushing punches kicks and omote renge (Front Lotus). And lets not forget the awesome villians Orochimaru Kabuto the famous Akatsuki! Now I'm not going to sugarcoat anything If I were to this review would be 10/10. There are some parts of naruto that has got me like wtf but before I get into that...SPOILERS AHEAD PLEASE DO NOT READ YOU HAD NOT WATCHED THE WHOLE SERIES!!!!!,2659,740,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well this isn't one of the best anime I've seen. Its mediocre the story revolves around too much of the one team Team 7; which consists of Naruto Sakura Sasuke and Kekashi. The only part of the character system is that Masashi didn't really explain the story of Sakura. The other characters although are quite the contrary they are all though up perfectly and which you can find one just like yourself in every way. The story is meh around the middle part of the adventure but the beginning of the anime is what really gets the story and plot going. I found the sound a bit hectic and sometimes be irritating especially when it came to the children's VA's. Naruto's was the most irritated of the whole bunch. Over all the anime isn't half bad I still prefer the manga over the anime; because then you can give them the appropriate voices that each characters needs or should some people would want them to sound like. ,2662,743,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story,2664,744,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I’m trying my best to write this review with a grain of salt but it’s not easy. I’ll be honest I used to hate Naruto hell I despised Naruto.  I hated his orange outfit I hated his blonde spikey hair and I hated that every picture I saw of him he had some sort of weapon in his mouth. I hated going to comic-con and instead of seeing people dressed as Spike from Cowboy Bebop I saw a bunch of Narutards running around with metal forehead protectors. I hated everything about the anime! …and yet I had never seen it.,2665,745,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before I start I'd like to say that this is not based on watching 220 episodes; i have skipped the filler that succeeds that Sasuke retrieval arc.,2666,746,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In the Hidden Village of Konoha young children are trained as ninjas in order to protect their home and those important to him. But to the young boy Naruto Uzumaki everything is a joke. He is a child without a family and without friends and so spends much of his time getting into mischief. But his dream is to become the strongest ninja of all—the Hokage—and when he is teamed up with Sakura and Sasuke his dreams are finally on the path to becoming true. Except he isn’t any good at being a ninja. But when he risks losing his first real friend Naruto is not afraid to put everything on the line. Can he become strong enough to save the troubled Sasuke?,2668,748,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie was half enjoyable half not.  Most of the time towards the end I'd be facepalming about three or four times because of how stubborn everyone was being.  I'll try not to reveal any spoilers as per usual but there were some glaring inconsistencies with the movie (which I watched for the first time after re-watching the series).,2671,751,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The count of Monte Cristo but with a new spin on it.

I will give this one props for an original take on the literary classic story but this definitely felt like anime on a budget as far as audio and visual production go. I probably could have really enjoyed this story--and probably would have watched more than 2 episodes--if the style of animation wasn't so (very) bad.,2682,762,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As the title says it's an anime adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo - which I personally haven't read but it's not necessary to read the book to understand the anime.,2685,765,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Gankutsuou boasts a provacative story and a unique animation style that serve its purposes well. Visually I was half-and-half (sometimes the colors were distracting but other times they were very beautiful); however it worked to the affect of the anime. The storyline is of course derived from a story I hadn't read since high school. Needless to say I was hesitant about revisiting 10th grade English in anime style but I had watched some of Romeo X Juliet and figured  what the hell I like almost everything Gonzo has put out so far.  I was pleasantly surprised. While the original Count of Monte Cristo is more of a  show those bad guys whose boss now  kind of story Gankutsuou is a moral exploration of the validness of revenge. The characters all progress in a relative and believable manner the parents eventually swirling in a psychedelic abyss of madness (literally in one episode); meanwhile the main character Albert who is at first whiny and naive comes full circle - he becomes whiny and experienced. There's some decent plot twists but I don't remember if those were already in the book or not. The music is sometimes pleasantly ambient but other times borders on cacophonous. The intro in particular had me reaching for the mute button but strangely grew on me by the last episode (which forces you to listen to an elongated version of the damn thing to see the last few bits of animation). The major promise this anime holds is in its extremely well-crafted and emotionally intense storyline; however the storyline does take a good while to build and the ending left me feeling a bit let down. Over all I would recommend it to fans of drama but not action. ",2688,768,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Based on the original Dumas story this anime a jewel in various ways most notable in the animaton (to which many disagree). Having read the novel a long time ago for my French classes I was quite intrigued seeing an anime adeptation. While there are too many differences to list the main points of the novel are still in place the tale tells a story of revenge greed jealousy and redemption and although pointers are clear since the start of the series it doesn't lesses the intrigue with each episode.,2689,769,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,2690,770,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Without a doubt The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books. A tale of lost love betrayal and revenge which made for a great ride through and through with the writing and the characters as the driving forces of the events that followed. After reading a bit about Gankutsuou I was unsure how it would remain faithful to the source material with it being all futuristic and trippy (A bit on that later). I checked out the manga and found myself hooked but I only found the first volume and left it at that. So until (relatively) recently I left it unwatched. But as soon as I started it up I found myself hooked beyond reason and once again dragged back into the world of the Count.,2691,771,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm going to keep this review rather short and elaborate on it at another time.,2692,772,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Even though I really enjoyed this anime there is certainly lots of room for improvement. I think most of the show's mistakes can be overlooked the severe lack of storyline really can kill it for some people. I found that during some points I had to force myself to continue watching simply because of the lack of excitement. Everything else like I said was either good or not bad enough for it to be a major problem. I personally really enjoyed this show however and would suggest it to most shouju fans. And if you want romance you should afterwards watch  the professional version.,2693,773,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Everything in this anime felt perfectly average and the STORY wasn't any exception.  Watch a young girl on her journey to become a world class Patissiere - she moves to the best pastry school in the country and of course be-friends the best looking boys in the school.  One thing that I LOVED about this anime however was the cute little sprites who helped out with the pastry making.  I was hoping that there would be little faeries when the first episode hinted at them and was not disappointed.  I would love to recommend this anime... if it wasn't so long!  50 episodes felt much too much for an anime that could have easily been shorted into 12.,2694,774,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,2695,775,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before I get down to it I feel like I need to ask a question of my fellow reviewers. How exactly is this criticised as being  mostly filler ? I may have misunderstood something but the story of this anime centers around a girl and her friends fulfilling their dreams of becoming patissiers right? Can we really complain then when the second half of the anime devotes itself mostly to a competition that brings the characters closer to that goal? Especially when there are fan-favorite ongoing anime like Naruto Shippuden out there that stop every five minutes to do ten episodes of filler because they're waiting for the manga to catch up?,2696,776,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Yay an OVA about Senji! He is by far the best character in my opinion so watching an episode devoted to his past sounded epic. It isn't that the episode was bad it was just cliche. I wanted him to have a more badass background and maybe see why he was put in Deadman Wonderland as a prisoner.,2702,782,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story is pretty much a Romeo and Juliet style with elemental gods instead of humans. This makes me have mixed feelings. While the story is so old and pretty much exactly what you would expect of the tale I do like the gods a bit. Sadly it was not enough to save the story as it felt bland in both voice acting and artwork. It just doesn’t pop at all and I felt myself becoming bored while watching it as there was no surprise no special meaning behind any of it.,2705,785,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Though it may not have action adventure or other things it's a very sweet and adorable show. I originally watched it just to past the time but as the episodes went on I grew to adore it and it's beautiful family. I wished it would never end but alas it had too eventually. I adored the way the sisters looked up to Wataru and his reaction to it all each sister had her own charm from Karen to Kaho I fell in love with each one of them. When came time for me to watch the last episode I felt like I was gonna cry it's a very sweet and adorable show. I will always think of it fondly.,2709,789,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Extras on the Brotherhood DVDs 4-koma Theater basically follows the storyline of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood while giving alternatives to certain scenes. (They are essentially omake chapters) The characters are similar if not identical to their portrayal in Brotherhood drawn in a choppy block-like style. The scenes are humerous and give a hint of whimsy to the dramatic storyline of Brotherhood.,2710,790,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This may be the last stage for the journey of Takumi Fujiwara and his Trueno 86 but it got my blood pounding!!! It may be only 4 episodes but I couldn't stop watching until I knew who won the last battle of Project D. The Final Stage of Initial D is an incredible and suspense-killing race that will have you on the edge of your seat. You will want to watch it more than one time!! I was literally shaking from the suspense of who would win the greatest street race of history! iCloud feel the rapid beating of my heart without even touching my chest!!!

A short and beautiful story about the inhabiting of a distant planet by aingle family. The animation was surprisingly good. Rather than theomewhat minimalistic designs used nowadays the animation hereesembled the better manga or comic books more. Music was also prettyood although some of the tunes really got on my nerves in the 2ndection of the movie.

Overall this had nothing to do with the Final Fantasy series itself and literally the worst plot-line ever. I wouldn't waste your time with it outside of the fact that it was an innovative movie for its time with CGI and Animation of 3D rendering beyond its time... other then that...not worth the time spent.,2730,808,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm writing this review for both seasons Selector Infected and Selector Spread as one is the continuation of the other and they both tell one story. Actually the second series is much better than the first but this is because the first introduced the story and characters while the second takes everything to its conclusion - so it's bound to feel more satisfactory. I read some reviews lamenting plot holes and pointing out many incongruous and implausible things in the first series; but really most of the inconsistencies are addressed and given an explanation in the second series so don't allow that to discourage you.,2734,812,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well it's my first Anime review of the year and what better way to make it a review of one of the biggest surprises of last year?,2736,814,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When is first found out about this anime it was from recommendations for Puella Magi Madoka Magica. It exceeded my expectations in most parts but let me down on minor parts. Let's start with the story it was very good and complex . At first it seems like your runoffthemill magical girl story where a girl is goven a special thing that unlocks her potential etc. But this one has a twist . Besides all of the battles the story has some drama with a girl who loves her brother a bit too much and a girl who ends up being screwed over by her own wish. Definitely dramatic and the you can see how each character changes and their challenges. Next the animation. It was good especially during battles when magic attacks were used. The rest of the animation wasn't problematic. Next the characters.  All of them were pretty unique in their own way all having personal challenges. The only thing was a character was brought it who was interesting but was never seen or even mentioned again.Alsso one of the 'antagonists' made a wish that didn't make sense. It was never explained and it seemed  a bit random. Yuzuki has the most problematic situation in my opinion. Not only did she have unrequited love but when it was returned  she wasn't even there to experience it. She developed a lot and was one of the more intense characters. Hitoe seems like your average shy moe girl but she's not going to be that way later on. She definitely had to suffer the most throughout the series. Her wish was granted but the reprocussions of that were brutal. Ru seemed like your average newbie to the world of WIXOSS all shy and stuff. But once she got into it she enjoyed battles a little too much. Similar to Hitoe her innocent character was shattered but from a different thing. It was kind of like PMMM in that aspect a character is messed up after learning the truth. Lastly sound. It was good for the most part being clear and going with the atmosphere. The opening threw me off slightly.  I'm not sure about everyone else but the opening sounded. ..off. it fit the show but the song was...odd. Overall a good series. It fit the psychological genre very well and it's somewhat dark despite the cute characters (like PMMM). I'm haven't seen the sequel yet but it plan on marathoning it.,2737,815,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the parts of this anime that disappointed me is that the anime was presented in a predictable way compared to the manga. Also Code:05 of the Code Breakers had a more feminine  look in the manga  than the anime. I was looking forward to her scenes in the show as she is my favourite but her appearence had me diasppointed. But as a big fan of the manga I felt that every voice actor was suited for their role. With the exception of Code:05 the characters' appearence were very similar to the manga and is detailed and pleasant to watch. Everyone was also interesting :D I'm a noob at reviews but it was a good anime :),2738,816,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really loved this one! When first begun to watch it was a bit suspicious about but in the end I've been sad because it had only 13 episodes.,2739,817,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2740,818,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Code:Breaker could of been so much greater than what it was for me at least. The story line started off nicely but slowly degraded into a mess pair that with one dimensional characters and you feel left wanting. A redeeming quality of this anime was the sound and animation while not the best I have ever seen it did have some moments of greatness.,2741,819,2019-04-13 21:35:40
(My opinion everyone) ,2742,820,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Code breaker made me fall in love. I wanted an anime with action cool fight scenes and lots of awesome powers. This satisfied my craving for violence while having an interesting storyline and great characters. As an anime I loved it. Then I read the manga. I still love the anime but I realize they kind of destroyed the manga. Not that they were completely different but they seemed to have chopped it up and spliced parts together to introduce all the characters even if in the manga they weren't part of the arc they decided to make into anime. Also it's over 200 chapters; this short anime had nothing on the manga. Its good but in the same way the movies for resident evil were. Enjoy the links to the game but don’t expect it to match it. Choosing to look at it from that point of view I enjoyed this anime I even watched it more than once. I did however curse the ending so badly that I decided to read the manga (as I hadn't yet) just to find out if the ending was different (because I am so hoping it is). The ending didn’t surprise me but the romantic/humanitarian in me was not satisfied. Then again this anime is not romance based so I shouldn’t expect a happily ever after still can't blame a girl for hoping lol.,2743,821,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Code:Breaker for me wasn't all that fantastic but at the same time it wasn't all that bad nothing really stood out to me in amazement but it was still enjoyable to watch. For this review sound and animation will not be commented on as far as I could tell there wasn't really anything wrong with them but again nothing really sparked any excitement.,2746,824,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Empecé a ver Yowamushi Pedal simplemente por pura curiosidad curiosidad nacida mientras pasando canales de la televisión me encontré con la transmisión del Giro de Italia. Sentí ganas de saber más de este deporte pero aunque soy un ferviente consumidor de literatura leer sobre deportes me aburre enormemente así que bueno siempre he pensado que cuando cualquier amante del anime le interesa un deporte siempre tiene a su disposición este. Y así di con Yowamushi Pedal (también existe Overdrive del 2007) del que ya de paso había escuchado muy buenas cosas.,2752,830,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ryuugamine Mikado lives an ordinary life. Going to an ordinary school with ordinary friends. So when the chance to move out of the country to Ikebukuro comes along who is he to ignore the chance to change his boring life to something extraordinary?

Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,2757,835,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"STORY:  When I first started watching Durarara the story is what drew me in quickly. Much like Baccano the story is told through multiple point of views and the story slowly is pieced together as you watched. In the beginning it seems confusing and a bit overwelming but you will be able to make sense of it fairly quickly. The first half of the story is excellent. There is plenty of excitement and suspense that keeps you clicking the next episode button. ",2758,836,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first season was great but as for the second season sadly I dropped it half way. Maybe one day I will get back into Durarara but I think the first season was enough for me.,2759,837,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:  Durarara!! is one of the most entertaining and elaborate stories I have seen in a long time.  It follows the lives of a large number of characters living in Ikebukuro showing how each of them are interconnected.  Thus because the story does not have a set  main character  the first couple of episodes left me a bit confused but completely enthralled.  I recommend to anyone watching this anime to bear through the confusion and to just let the story unfold because it will eventually begin to make sense once all the characters have been introduced.  I will not give any spoilers but my one complaint is the ending.  It left me unsatisfied and wanting another season (which may or may not happen at this point.)  Several of the main plot points were never resolved.  However this is one of the only animes where I would still recommend watching it even if they don't make another season.  The good aspects Durarara!! possesses far out weigh what it lacks.,2760,838,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this was a good anime...i like the dark feel and the detail that went into the animation of this show...i loved all the characters and each had a pivotal role in the series...i just didn't like the ending...i feel celty's chapter (who I thought at first was the main character) was never closed...hopefully we will see a 2nd season....!,2761,839,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Durarara is not your favorite horror story.  It is not a harem or love story that goes on and on about these 2 young lovers.  It is not made up of non stop action in every single episode.  What Durarara is . . . . hm. . .it is a class of its own and it pulls it off in an amazingly charming way. I will miss this anime a little bit.,2762,840,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When I heard from a friend that this came from the same author of Baccano! I immediately looked for it and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.,2765,841,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:Oringally I only checked this anime out because one of the lead characters had the same name as the handle that I have been using since 2002. (Kida) and even more I was told his personality was simliar to mine with a dark twist. What could I say I had to check it out no matter what. This was one of the best written animes I have seen. If not the best. The first season draws you in with two distinct mysteries. whcih amazingly enough tie together as a beuatifullly interlaced puzzel. The second season builds on the character relationships which had been esitablished in the first part and brought to full light small details which had been mentioned in the first half. This prove that the plot line had been very well thoughout with heavy foreshadowing. no plot resolution was pulled out of nowhere but that's not to say that the resolutions and twists weren't surprises. The second half of the series relys very very heavily on irony. (the ture defintion of irony: when the veiw/reader knows something that the character does not) It has a make shift resolution whcih leaves the door open for a second season (Hopefully),2769,845,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One thing that Durarara!! does well is character development increasing the effectiveness of the plot devices used. The clusterfuck near the end wouldn't have enough impact if the characters were weak. Additionally even the characters you rarely see are developed in a way that makes them memorable. I watched the subbed version and a bit of the dubbed to see how I felt about it and I feel like both did an excellent job of aligning voice actors with character design. It has a great balance of action and suspense with comedy making it a feel good anime with enough substance to be engaging. ,2778,852,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Here is my compact review,2780,854,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Durarara!! Where to start...? This series is... AWESOME!! it's strongest point is it's characters. You even like the characters you hate... it makes sense... kinda. The story is great. I can't explain the story without spoiling it. And it's rare to find a recent anime without much fan service so this is a good change.(unless you like fan service...),2781,855,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,2782,856,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ahhhh Durarara lets get this out of the way first no this is not Baccano and really it tries to be (I think there was a Baccano reference every other episode and even a crossover) but the fact that it's trying to be its older brother doesn't hinder it that much. One of the main reasons this show get compared to Baccano is that it not only was done by the some studio but it also just happens to based on the light novels that were written by the same guy who wrote the Baccano light novels. Now with that out of the way on with the review.,2783,857,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Durarara!! is the kind of anime that only comes once in a blue moon. It's an anime that is praised exceptionally by nearly everyone and deserves much of that praise. In fact it's an anime that you've most likely already seen and have an opinion about. Four years ago it played on Adult Swim where it garnered a lot of attention from a group of anime fans who'd never seen something so uniquely written and laid out. It's a show that makes you want to live in its' world and also get to know all of its' characters. The rare kind of show that pulls you in and keeps you watching out of obsession and total entertainment.,2784,858,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Warning this review probably will contain spoilers-,2785,859,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So I just finished watching the series. And I warn you: this review may be a little over the place because I'm still freaking out about what just happened and a thousand ideas are running through my mind.,2786,860,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've been meaning to watch this for a while but haven't had the time to.  Now that I have the time while being on break from school I've restarted watching anime.  I first saw a poster on Crunchy Roll and I thought the art style was amazing.,2787,861,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What will I write is not really a review. It is something like what I understand from Durarara!,2788,862,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Durarara!! is a show that has been recently receiving a lot of attention and praise. I went to check out the 24 episodes and found myself at an inner conflict with this anime. Though I was awed by how intricate and well planned the plot and characters were I thought the second season (episodes 13 and on) slacked and left a lot to be desired.,2789,863,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Its interesting how the author has these seemingly unrelated characters come together and move the story along. Its starts out extremely slow then it quicly picks up and gets very compelling. highly recommended,2790,864,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's confusing to watch at first because it does not follow a straight storyline like most anime. However by doing this you get to learn a little about all of the main and secondary characters before it all starts coming together which happens around episodes 8-12. From then on it is like other anime where you are following one plotline. ,2791,865,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Finally after months of putting this show off I have finally come around in watching it. Durarara is a unique show that contains various characters genres and storylines. Just about every episode focuses on a different character perspective despite the fact the main protagonist is Mikado. The great appeal of Durarara is its diverse and colorful mix of personalities of numerous characters. Overall this is by far one of the best animes I have seen in a while. I'd recommend it to anyone no matter what their tastes are since it has a bit of everything and an excellent cast of characters.,2797,871,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It was an interesting story as there are no real focused main character. In this sense most of the main characters are on equal ground in how they influence the story as the series progresses. The main elements that stuck out to me was the use of instant messaging and the connections between the characters. The instant messaging is an interesting concept as the characters chat with each other using aliases. This aliases (or the concept in general) was confusing at times because it seemed to happen a little fast. It was slightly difficult to find out who was talking. Though the aliases and their color code gives a hint of who they represent. Most of the aliases were figured out by the end of the series but i did not think too hard about it regardless. Still it was interesting to see most of the characters interact with each other while not necessarily knowing who they were.,2799,873,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime was so great. the simple fact that i dropped this in middle school because the first episode was kind of boring and then i gave it another chance in 9th grade and was just blasted away with its amazingness. The best characters to me are the minor ones like WOW the otakus friends/couple was so relatable although they wernt focused on at all and the black german were giving me LIFE.,2803,877,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I started out not really liking this anime. The beginning seemed to happy. But as it went on and on things got more intertwined until its was just a complete cluster of great story. Although I wasn't impressed with some of the characters the other half made up. I would definitely recommend this to others.,2804,878,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Durarara!! is a very unique anime it is all about how the beautiful city of tokyo has great drakness. it has unique charcters and their devolpments is amazing. Personally i believe that this anime should have the psychological tag as is it always explains human activtiy also the events that happen which cause charcter change are quite frequant.,2805,879,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ah....Ushio and Tora....brings back memories......ok enough....I feel like an old man. Ushio and Tora is a very good anime...though corny and sometimes childish this series is very humorous. Ushio and Tora fits all of the stereotypes of bad shonen anime: ugly character designs lots of fighting and a  save the female love interest  plot line. However get past all of that and you have a genuinely funny ova series. If you get sick of shows like inuyasha that stretch on forever but somehow miraculously get nowhere...I highly recomend Ushio and tora. It is only 10 episodes long and its truely a great series.

As a fan of spirits yokai and various sappy slice of life dramas just seeing the description and the teaser trailer had me pretty interested. It was a cute anime to watch with my girlfriend and something that gave us a reason to make a real crunchyroll account for. Every week we'd cuddle up in my dorm room and we would watch a sweet girl live out her peaceful life at the local shinto shrine with the grumpy old Shrine Herald who only she had the spiritual talent to see. it was cute it was relaxing it was a little *cough*bara*cough* and we loved every second of it.,2821,893,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A heartwarming story. People who is interested in the tradition religious aspect (eg. inari shrine) and pratice of japan will most probably like this show. 10/10 for sound because the BGM is just great! The story is more like the everyday lives of the main characters. overall the characters are very cute,2822,894,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There's nothing particularly offensive about Record of the Lodoss War. But perhaps that's where half it's problems lie. It's a perfectly normal perfectly blueprint kind of high fantasy - only as if written by the inadequate Terry Brooks rather than the seminal J RR Tolkien. It's bad enough when considering that many contemporaries of the show achieve far greater originality but in light of how far the fantasy genre has come since shows like FMA I see nobody today finding any redeeming features in this nondescript antiquated work. Everything that happens comes straight out of the Manual Of How to Write a Cliche. From the zero-to-hero protagonist to bad guys that want POWER! HAHAHAHAHA! to magic forests that attack you. Hell the party on a quest consists of a magician a thief an elf a human and a burly dwarf. D&D; lovers help yourselves - everyone else needn't bother.,2824,896,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I finally got a chance to watch this movie.  One thing I do want to note is that my review is based off of the JAPANESE VERSION of the movie not the English dub.  I can't stand the English voice actors for the characters ever since they were changed sometime after Hoenn I believe so I haven't watched the English dub since.  I will still use the dub names since people are more familiar with those.,2828,900,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's been perhaps one of the best animes I've seen. Compared to the first series this one went to a whole other level with twisted and demented and I loved every second of it. I think I was so busy thinking about what was going to happen next that I forgot to focus on what was happening right then. As for Alois Trancy I must say he made the entire second season. It was brilliant if you're wondering about my opinion. I know a lot of people found it a little more sick that desired especially since they entered a perverted old man in the series who went a little far but for me that added dramatics. I thought it was pure genius and worth watching. The story line was interesting I never knew what was coming next which is good because I hate predictable animes. As for the sound the music was pure beauty. I must say though I wasn't found of him at first I began to love the new demons introduced even Hanna.,2831,903,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As much as I loved the first season of this show I actually didn't care for this part of it all that much. I have a few reasons as to why but I'll try to just keep it short. Your introduced first off to two new characters and as much as I enjoy new characters in a series even if they are added to the set of main characters I really didn't care for these two. Alois just seems to be fairly annoying and very spoiled. Where you learn in season one Ciel had a good reason for doing what he did I feel it lacked the explination for Alois in season two. His butler Claude he just seemed more of a copycat of Sebastian though even at that he was a poor one. The storyline was lacking in my opinion and I honestly don't even really care if they decide to make a season three after watching this. I felt like it was a waste of time and personally I felt they should have just stopped at season one with the cliffhanger ending. ,2832,904,2019-04-13 21:35:40

While I thought the underlying concept of this season was interesting I found its presentation to be terrible. All exposition was delayed until the last two episodes and the story before that was consequently mostly confusing but in a frustrating way rather than a good dramatic way. A lot of the plot devices felt extremely contrived and a decent premise was wasted. It felt as if the writers didn't really know where the story was going until the last minute. Definitely didn't live up to the first season. I did enjoy the final resolution though even if the path there wasn't too great. There were also a couple of major plot events in the first season that seemed to be completely discarded beyond that which was explanable by Ciels memory loss (dont worry that's not really a spoiler).,2838,910,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kuroshitsuji II/Black Butler 2 was a great anime. I think it was better than season one. It had more hot characters better story and in my opinion better everything. I think if you didn't like the first season watch the second season. It's so much better.,2839,911,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,2840,912,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The second season of Kuroshitsuji was a fine season indeed. Overall I’d give it a 9/10.  The anime was great! The action and plot kept me interested the music and animation were most delightful and the characters (though not the greatest) were good as well.,2841,913,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you haven't seen Black Butler 1 I advise you to see it before you see this one( if your the type of person to not watch animes in chronological order. In Black Butler 1 Ciel Phantomhive made a deal with a demon to eat his soul in return the demon had to play butler and help him get revenge. The reason there was a continuation was because the demon Sebastian was unable to eat his soul due to the fact that he lost the seal(his arm) in battle. Black Butler 2 talks about a boy with a similar case to Ciel however his demon wanted no part of him when he realized his soul was tainted(the boy loved the demon).BB2 was at first confusing because they never announced that Ciel had amnesia in the first place. The plot twist at the end was very deceving but was really interesting at the same time. I can't tell if Hannah was a dynamic character or not. They made her seem really dense at first but her alterior motive was great! If you love demons and drama you would adore Black Butler 1 and 2 all together. There is a bit of nudity(but somewhat censored). The grim reaper sure releaves some of the drama but he does play an important role.,2842,914,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,2847,915,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AWESOME! MUST WATCH! This anime is one of my very many favorites I really would like to see a third if you hven't seen the second one watch it now! ,2848,916,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,2851,917,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Upon viewing the scores I'd say this one is pretty much love it or hate it...and i must say this was fucking good. I wasn't expecting this to be so good especially after the gorgeous first season. I thought the intro of new characters was well done and the step up on violence was awesome. The story was dark and brutal and the twists were well thought out. At first i was a bit confused after last season's ending but stick with it for about 4 eps and they explain what happened. While waiting for that you get to meet a slew of new characters as well as reunite with old ones. Ugh I recommend both parts 1 and 2. The series as a whole is so perfect. i loved Alois as an evil character. His back story was so sad and painful and the twists from the end of episode 6 on were unexpected and shocking...and the endinggggg. It was so frustrating and sad...man this was a great show. I'm angry to have finished it already. Lol,2852,918,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Black butler is a very very well known anime about the contract between a demon (Sebastian Michaelis) and a 13 year old Earl (Ciel Phantomhive). As this is the second season I'm sure you know the general outline of what happens to these lovely lads but here is a brief summary. In the second season a new Earl is introduced called Alois Trancy and his butler Claude. Their motives seem innocent enough at first until it's revealed they're only interested in taking Ciel as their own plaything. A unique idea of course which is well paced across 12 episodes and not too difficult to follow (which is great for me)!. However at some points it did seem a little dragged out and that is why the story gained a measly score of 6. ,2858,919,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well honestly this anime really didn't have the same essence as the first season of kuroshitsuji and if I'm being completely honest the only episodes that I really enjoyed of this season were the last two. Saying that however the first season of kuroshitsuji left me with higher expectations for the second season and so it is quite likely that this is the reason for this less than great review. This season focus' still on Ciel and Sebastian but introduces two new character Claude and Alois Trancy. After having completed his goals in the first season it is assumed that Sebastian devours Ceil's soul but this is not the case as Ceil's soul was stolen by Claude and so Sebastian and Ceil return to the realm of the living with one minor hitch Ceil has lost all of his memories regarding Angela Blanc the Queen and the time of which he was seeking his revenge. Kuroshitsuji 2 isn't bad by any means but after watching the first season of kuroshitsuji it is plausible that this second season will leave you disappointed. It's as if this season is a desperate attempt to continue a popular series but it isn't as well thought out as the first season. Not comparing it to the first season kuroshitsuji 2 is quite good with a fairly generic plot of getting revenge and the introduction of yet another demon and another boy with a tainted past is also equally interesting but really considered on its own it is basically an average anime.,2859,920,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was sort of disapointed about Kuroshitsuji II because for 1 it was a lot shorter than the first2 I didn't like some of the charactersand three I thought that the Alois would come out of the computer and kill me in my sleep. A.K.A the guy was nuts.I did like the idea of 2 demon butlers and their masters fighting one another though.For me the ending was the best.I can't tell you the details but I can say there's a big twist at the end.Teehee ^ W ^,2861,921,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As I watched the first episode of the series I thought to myself  this could be a really great anime. It has everything there.  Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to these expectations; it was by no means a terrible anime however. The concept of dreams and how they are displayed in this series is rather interesting and many things that are slowly revealed throughout the series are extremely interesting. Anyways on to the story.,2868,927,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love this anime it's the best one i've watched. I do reccomend watching it and I think you should give it a try :D but of course you don't have to tho. I thought what was really great about this anime is that 1. No romance 2. Awesome music 3. Great storyline :) I reccomend it and that's that! I think it's super duper really awesome!,2881,936,2019-04-13 21:35:40
They say that variety is the spice of life but if that's true then why is there such a lack of it in anime and manga? Part of the problem stems from the fact that there seems to be a certain number of themes that can be considered the  bread and butter  of the industry but the subject of dreams is surprisingly not one of them. This is more than a little odd as Eastern folklore is littered with stories about dreams and one has to wonder why such a rich and varied theme tends to be ignored.,2882,937,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,2883,938,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not only is Capeta a sports anime but one about one I don't especially care about - motorsports. It passed under the radar a few years ago without much attention. But it's good - the kind of series that creeps up on you and before you realize it you're sweating and shouting and raising your hands in triumph or groaning in despair. It's the characters that matter and this series makes you really care for them - especially the likable and inspiring lead Taira Capeta. The action sequences are terrific too. Be open-minded and give it a shot - you might be surpised...,2884,939,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well what can I say about this anime? Well let’s start with the story. It is very typical of ecchi genre the male lead lives alone and is chased by many girls but I didn’t mind the stereotype too much because the characters were very likable and for varies reason I felt for them. The main character Kouta is the usual indecisive type but I can sort of understand in this case with Chizuru and Nozomu throwing themselves at him he has little time to breathe let alone make up this mind.,2895,946,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Not a bad little drama/ecchi fest. I kinda liked it to beompletely honest. I felt bad for poor Kouta a few times but then so damnealous that I wanted to strangle him. Chizuru was top notch I actually likeder quite a bit. Nozumu? Nozomu? (haven’t really paid attention to her name)as pretty annoying I didn’t’ like her much at all. Chizuru’s brother wasretty funny. I liked him too. Overall it wasn’t as bad as some made it out toe.,2904,952,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Many people have strong prejudice against mecha genre. It is supposedly shallow cliche boring and pointless.

Still awkward and uncouth Teppei mustomehow adjust to high society. With girls purusing him at every turnowever that may be the least of his concerns...  (site synopsis),2928,970,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first half was enjoyable fluff. Big-boobed ecchi comedy that flows very nicely. Had it continued in that vein I would have given this anime an 8/10. The second is incredulous to the extreme. When foreign mercenaries with automatic weapons and bombs commit acts of terrorism abduction and grand theft railroad do you contact the authorities or send the nephew and butler over-seas on a special-op mission? It's so stupid I was face palming every five minutes and shaking my head in-between. So for the second half 4/10.,2929,971,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As this show sits in the echhi and harem genre and seeing as how ive watched plenty of them i must say that i was absolutely suprised by the first episode. I thought id stumbled upon a hidden gem within the genre. Our lead Teppei was not the usual shy boy and had his own problems to deal with we immediately had a bit of drama and suprisingly the action wasnt bad with quite fluid animation and Charlotte our first heroine was suprisingly quirky. Given this i was quite excited.,2930,972,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Dear god talk about disappointment really........ame to watch this anime with goodxpectations the summary for the story seem uniquend interesting because the mainharacter  Teppei Arima was the exception tohe rule about you typical boy that his life ishange because of a girl  and he is pathetic and helpless which is not thease in this anime.,2935,976,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Hello again and after many a delay here it is my review for Princess Lover!,2936,977,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It started out as a generic harem anime but then it evolves into a poorly plotted political drama. The villain has a flimsy reason for attacking the main character and it just seems to be an excuse to tie up a female character with big boobs. The comedy often comes from cliches about rich people and they aren't even that well done.,2937,978,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"This started out ok. I hate harems so i was suprised i was actually enjoying it. But around ep 8 or so they decided to completely change the direction of the anime and completely ruined it trying to be something that it wasn't. I was very disspointed as i thought i finally found a harem i could sit and enjoy... boy was i wrong... my rating is a 5 because i did enjoy it for most of the anime but it was totally ruined by the sudden  plot twist  ",2938,979,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Princess Lover is a 12 episode ecchi harem anime. I for one hate these genres but I don't believe in pre-judging and this was on my 'to watch' list so I gave it a chance. I settled down with a few cans of cider and prepared for the worst. I got mixed impressions from the first episode. It seems like there'd be good action and revenge. The only plot is ep1 7-13. I stick by my philosophy on plots if the main character doesn't choose a girl by the end this doesn't gett more than 5. And he gets engaged in the first episode so it's worse that he doesn't get with a girl.,2941,980,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Started off really well. The first two episodes introducedhat didn’t seem like it would turn into a harem at all but man oh man was Irong about that. It’s harem galore especially towards the later episodes.ome of it really was funny I’ll give it that much but Arima’s cheesynessinda ruined a LOT of that in the last few episodes. Hazelrink was the mostnnoying in the group of 4 girls with the other 3 ranking sooooo much higher inuality compared to her. All Charlotte had going for her were boobs that’s it.er ditsy personality was too much for me.,2942,981,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For the first part of this anime i found that the storyline was interesting and entertaining. I especially loved seeing how the main character handled different situations for better or for worst and how the other girls in his harem with their different personality helped him and the role they played in his life. The art for this anime was also pretty good.,2945,984,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Chihayafuru is an average anime. I have nothing significantly bad to say about it yet at the same time giving it anything more than a 6 doesn't feel right.,2946,985,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love this anime because the plot is interesting and unique. The characters are awesome especially the main chracter because she is beautiful not arrogant and cheery. The male main character is what spoils it because I think the main character deserve some1 better that him. The drawing is what u would call perfect.,2947,986,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is so fucking shit I watched 5 episodes of this bullshit because of all these nerds overhyping it but it's just the same generic bullshit as with every other sports anime except now it's a shitty card game. Some nerd doesn't want to play because a relative died some kid has a too big dream and one dude is just trying to get himself some booty but he's beta as fuck.,2954,992,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have noe idea why but I love this anime. I usually like action animes like Naruto or Fairy tail or romance anime like Special A but there is something about this anime. The story is just starting and i have only seen a few episodes but i can't get enough. There is some romance vibes in this so that is an extra plus but I will probably watch it anyway. It may seem boring but TRY IT! It is really worth a try. I think it is amazing.,2955,993,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai Movie 2: Satsujin Kousatsu (Part 1) is a good hour of anime. It is not the best but it is definitely good. At times it is even great. There are a few problems with it but it is ultimately an enjoyable and intriguing experience. The premise is a fascinating combination of slice of life psychological thriller romance and serial murder going on. If only for that this is a worthwhile view.,2967,5,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie was recomended to me by a co-worker. At first I didn't actually got interested in it but after going to a store and see the novel book and looking at a few pages I became intrigued with the story and I have to say I don't regret watching it. Its a beautiful story of unconditional maternal love with real life struggles. ,2989,23,2019-04-13 21:35:40

best anime i seen tuched my heart so many times. Each time i watch it i cry. The music went perfectly with the movie. although the ending was a little bumer  i belive they should have added a little happyness for the mom nut other then that it was a great ending. i hope one day i will be able to touch peopple with my anime just like the way this anime tuched me.,2993,26,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Wolf Children is a pretty good watch if your looking for something emotional engaging and well-narrated. So yes while I was watching it I was totally engaged. Problem is that as soon as you finish it it just seems to slide really quickly and effortlessly into oblivion.,3000,31,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was recommended by a few people to watch this movie but it took me a while as the summary sounded a little weird. But I'm glad I ended up watching it! I think this is one of my favorite anime movies! The story is very different and unreal but I think it is very relatable. I loved every character. They were well developed. I would definitely recommend giving this a try!,3001,32,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Just beautiful suggest watching alone for the full impact of the movie. Drove me to tears the first time I watched it and fell in love immediatley.,3002,33,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have seen this movie pop up here and there on websites and soical media. I was always interested but I never had gotten around to watching it. I work at a library and I happen to see it on our shelf and I quickly grabbed it to take home and watch. I didn't know what I was getting into but I'm glad I did. I absolutly loved it. I thought the story was beautful the characters were unique and the animation/sound was great. I would recomend this to any of my friends to give a try.,3003,34,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was a very touching and beautiful anime. I cried from start to finish and just loved how the story was about the struggles of a single mom who defeated the odds despite her unique situation. It is one of the few animes that stuck with me throughout.,3004,35,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I cannot stress enough how good the story for this movie was.  I (like most of the other reviews I read) was very skeptical of this movie based on the synopsis I read on here.  However once I really got into watching it the story was not shallow and childish as I had worried it might be.  If you like slice-of-life movies then this is definitely one you want to check out.  ,3005,36,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I first picked up the manga in the book store didnt buy it but read a couple pages. Then I came across it online and didnt relize it was a movie!

This is a moving tale of a single young mother's unshakeable determination to make a life for herself and her two young children. Though enjoyable purely on its own as a magical realist/fantasy story it also reads well as a metaphor for raising mixed families in a climate of discrimination racism and xenophobia.,3009,40,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie is absolutly amazing. Everything about it is incredible; the plot the characters the artwork and etc.. (you get the picture) The ending is very touching too..  (warning spoiler! kind of..) but i still wish i could see Ane visit her or something.. If i did i would definetly rate this a 10/10. You know? I would love it more if the ending was Hana would be doing her housework or something in her house and Ane suddenly comes and say  I'm back mom.  And then she and him will cry and then hug and then i'll explode with emotion.. ,3014,44,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The very first anime I saw when I was little :) really loved it!!!♡ and the story is original I think the main characters  (especially grown up Lynn x Edward shipping is the best even as a child I saw them like a beautiful couple♡♡). Of course the cruel fate of Lymm  really breaks a heart of everyone who has a heart himself but because she's strong-willed and kindhearted you really start to believe that she can move mountains :) really beautiful anime I highly recommend it for those who like shoujo ;),3016,46,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I saw that this show had scenes in Washington D.C so I had to check it out. Like many animes it was time for the characters to go back to Japan. Watching it out of curisoty I sat down to see where this would go. I did not excpet such a high stake game being played in the show. The character designed seemed almost childlike. It worked for the show however. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes spy or espionage related stuff. ,3026,54,2019-04-13 21:35:40

STORY,3035,61,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Eden of the East is just one of those shows that within the first half of an episode you know you're either going to like the series or going to for the most part completely dislike the series.  Within the first several minutes of the show we get the female lead Saki meeting main character Akira Takizawa who is standing completely naked and holding a gun if front of all places the  White House .  Then from that point on the story draws the viewer into a high stakes game of life and death that makes it next to impossible to stop oneself from continuing onto the next episode.  For I was really quite surprised at how quickly the show drew me in and kept me interested until its end which seemed to come much to quickly.  Though of course that lead me to watching the movies almost immediately afterward but those are completely different reviews.  Something of course has to be said about the characters and the animation in general because I for some reason or another found the characters to be completely adorable in their apperance.  Especially Saki she just had a face that made you want go over and hug.  As for the sound well the opening was nice and catchy but the soundtrack as a whole was for the most part unremarkable.  Though there may have been one other song in there that I really liked but I can't quite remember if it was in the show or just the movies.  As for the characters well the main character Akira Takizawa I found it almost impossible to dislike let alone hate him for even a second.  Though that being said most of the other characters tend to fall quite a bit short.  Especially the series's antagonist who for the most part seem mostly undeveloped with the most interesting one of the bunch being Kuroha Diana Shiratori who has a thing for cutting off men's more private parts.  Though something has to be said for Juiz who for some reason or another was just as lovable and charming as the main character.  Overall I still don't know what exactly it was about Eden of the East that drew me in so easily but one thing is certain and that is that I don't regret watching a single minute of it.,3036,62,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Eden of the East is actually not bad. That being said it is not good either. There is no particular fault in anything (except perhaps the female lead's nose which is annoying as hell) and yet there is no real impact to anything. The opening is brilliant one of the greatest ones ever. Naked guy waving a gun around (who seems to be a rather friendly bloke) that's just about as awesome a hook as you can get. The problem is that there is no payoff. The ending is supposed to be an original and beautiful thing encapsulating the deamer's spirit and whatnot. Call me a cynic but I didn't really care for it. And dammit Saki what is wrong with your nose?,3046,69,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The STORY of Eden of the East wasn't a bad one however this anime had been so hyped up for me that I was expecting more.  The idea of a game having to do with people's lives and connecting it to what had happened three months prior in that incident called  Careless Monday  was very interesting for me and I was easily drawn into this anime.  However I felt something was missing - I think that with a plot like this I expected something more action-packed or perhaps something darker.,3062,81,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tristia of the Deep Blue Sea is an ova based off of a PS2 and PC game in which a girl named Nanoca Flanka is sent to the sea-side town of Tristia to help revitalize the local economy though the questions associated with why she was sent there are left unexplained in the ova and you would have to have had played the game to understand some of these things.  But the ova doesn't even really focus on these things and instead tends to focus on the golem competition that is at the center of the two episodes.  That pretty much sums up the entire series an extremely lame mecha competition/battle with some rather lame robots.  That's pretty much all you need to know about the story of Tristia.  Though that's not to stay that the ova doesn't have anything going for it.  In the visual department it looks fairly nice though about what you would expect coming for an show based off of a game.  The characters while for the most part generic still looked nice and while the mecha were lame they were still somewhat interesting to look at.  Though the sound had some good points and some bad points.  The soundtrack was overall fairly decent but the voice acting I thought was simply terrible but that's just me.  Overall if you go into Tristia not expecting a whole lot then you'l come out getting what you expected.  But if you go in expecting something great or decent then you'll leave mostly disappointed.,3070,88,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin - Extra Chorus is (hopefully) the last hurrah of the Kara no Kyoukai series. In essence its a series of shorts that is about giving some closure to the cast of the series. It is a bit of fluff to enjoy and nothing more. Not that this is a bad thing but still it should be called what it is: a bonus feature. Of course that is basically in the name (Extra Chorus really does give that away).,3080,98,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Afro ken is a masterpiece of animation. The brilliance of the plot that will bring you to tears the characters who will blind you with there awesome symbolism of fahisom and the death of dreams when they are achieved and the animation that will make anime like paprika cut there wrists because they know it can compare. Now some fools may clame that this is just a shitty comershil written buy someone who took to much acied but i have to say it isent random nonsenciel giberish. Its pure genus masked with nonsensicol insanity. Think the last two episodes of evangellion accept this docent suck. In all seriousness afro ken is the meaning of so bad its good. This ova is so hillariouis that i almost cried. My favorite part is how they tried to make afro ken out to be some kind of god to be worshiped. and went as far to say that he can feel your pain. This is a must watch for fans of bad movies like plan 9 from outer space or fans of mst3k because its like watching one of those movies. I highly recommend this if you can find it but only if you have a good scence of humor. ,3085,101,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Lets start with the story of Trigun. To start this show has a great story the reason it is great is because it keeps you hooked. After each episode I just wanted to watch more to find out what happens. The pacing is superb and allows for someone to be interested while not being bored as it sets up the rest of the story. Nothing in the story felt rushed. Also the story evolves from being something that just seems like a cool western with not much story to begin with into an amazing plot. It escalates and gets better each episode which makes this story amazing.,3087,103,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Its older so the animation leaves a bit to be desired. Do not let that stop you from watching this. It is one of the best anime i have ever seen! It was funny and Vash who is an outlaw worth lots and lots of money to anyone that can capture him is one of my all time favorite anime characters. He is idealistic and ironically its not his fault he is worth so much money. Bad crap happens around him usually as a result of him stopping something worse from happening. Yet he never wavers and goes bad or loses his ideals. He is 100% against taking human life not much of a oitlaw and he sticks to that no matter the situation throughout the whole anime. He is cheerful seems dense but do not be fooled he isnt really and his attitude is just plain down right happy go lucky. The other characters are fine but honestly doesnt matter who or what they are like because Vash steals the show (luckily he is the main character so it works). The sound effects and music are good and other than wishing the animation style was a bit more updated there is nothing about this anime that can be complained about.,3110,122,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show is incredibly frustrating for me.  This isn't because it's poorly done.  It isn't because it's badly written or the characters are flat or the animation is shoddy.  No... It’s because this anime could have been so much more than it turned out to be.  What frustrates me more than anything is the untapped potential of this show.  It just needed a little more polishing and focus to achieve brilliance.  Allow me to elaborate further.,3131,135,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a peaceful delightful little series filled with lots of love and warmth.  The soundtrack and artstyle compliment the story.  Delicate and sincere this show is perfect for anyone looking for a touching story about a young girl who suddenly finds herself in a completely new culture.,3136,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kiki's Delivery Service is another one of the many Studio Ghibli films that will steal your heart.  There's nothing like Studio Ghibli to make you feel happy and free.  It's the only way I can describe it.  I grew up on Totoro and Kiki's Deliver Service was my second Studio Ghibli film I ever saw.  I've seen it so many times since then.  I'm 22 and I still love watching these films and I feel like a carefree kid again when they're done.,3151,144,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For me growing up Kiki's Delivery Service was a movie that took me into a world of wonder and imagination. I would have to say that the characters were relatable enough and that I wanted them to achieve their goals. Kiki's Delivery Service was the first anime that I had ever seen and since then I have expanded into many different types of animes. I rated the story a 7. Mostly because I forgot most of the story and only remembered the best scenes in the movie. The animation also a 7 was good for the time it was made but could have been better. The sounds in this movie were wonderful! The only character that I remember is Kiki so I wouldn't give the characters a high mark.,3152,145,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Genuinely creepy and entertaining. A very beautiful anime with interesting stories and themes I especially anjoyed the story of the forgotten gods and Oiwa. I find the last one lost its touch a tiny wenie bit with the comdy bits put in but still was very entertaining I would recommend it to anyone. Lovin it,3162,152,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Posting this review as part of my Secret Santa 2013 participation.  Preliminary:  Very rough notes.  This is not my final review but rather some observations made while watching this.  I'll be back soon to clean this up and finalize the review presentation. =),3166,155,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Out of all three arcs by far the third was the best. But the mostnjoyable for me was the first. I enjoyed the story more and while I’mll for weird art that’s where the third arc lost points for me.,3167,156,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I stepped into this series with the false expectation that it should be similar to the off-shoot series derived from it Mononoke. Oh how two-thirds wrong I was! Er a better explanation is that only the last story of three separate stories is related to the Mononoke counterpart. If you are a fan of Mononoke I suggest starting at that story arc and going backwards after finishing each arc or perhaps only watching the last arc simply because most reviewers including myself agree that the stories are arranged worst to best.,3171,157,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,3174,158,2019-04-13 21:35:40
An extreamly strange anime. That is simular to Draon Half or Slayers in it's over all theme. If you wish to watch a random or silly anime then this is one for you it is fairly short so dosen't take up a lot of your time the story line is next to none existant.,3175,159,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is pretty much just hentai and it clears a little bit up about what happens after the main Green Green story without watching this OVA Green Green will be a sad anime.,3180,162,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I wish this anime would have been longer.I was kinda dissapointed.There wasn't much romance.What I hate the most is they don't tell you who she ends up with.,3182,163,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Beautiful and wonderful story line. Captures your heart into music and makes you feel the characters. Each character has their own personaliy that is relateable and great.,3183,164,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well this was a nice change of phase from all thether Ah my Goddess past series which was rather refreshing.,3185,165,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Cute quirky and full of color. This anime is not only bright in color it also shines bright for its characters. Though this anime may not be for everyone I do recommend going in with a open mind and look past the Atypical Ecchi. This is a different spin on Ecchi that is far more creative in its  reveal  than other similar themed anime (pantsu). If you subtract the male lead and the foolish cat then you see that this show has some really smart strong female leads that remind me of the women in Princess Jellyfish. ,3186,166,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's amazing how many elements and themes they put into 12 episodes. Magical girl transformation time travel  gender flipping it's like a list of various Japanese otaku culture themes from previous anime series put together into one cohesive plot arc and small group of close characters.,3190,167,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Great storyline and all I don't write reviews to often however I feel that this one is special. While it knows when and how to be serious it knows how to make you laugh when the time is right. (Cough* ghost cats internet history) yes I forgot his name because I'm a bit dumb. However near the ending I was pretty interested in it and wanted a great ending the ending to me was a little... Empty.(SPOILER WARNING)when the man character does at the end and then you see that the home from that timeline will go back to make sure this all makes sense. He says that he will as well go back to December 21 and when you think about it that means he's creating an endless cycle now somewhere along the line plans could change a little and he live but no matter how you look at the ending he dies at least 2 times the reason its twice min is because the ghost him from his world wouldn't have to go back but still he would probably go to December 21 which would make it an endless cycle. This man is forced to live and (maybe) die forever living the same life over and over. However the rest of the story board had me hanging on for a long time would like more if ever possible.,3192,168,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Probably on the ecchi side of anime this will be the most perverse anime this season alongside Highschool DxD BoRn.,3193,169,2019-04-13 21:35:40
At first it seems weird and non-sensicle but don't give up on it! This is one of the most well thought out animes I've watched in quite some time. Before you're even halfway through you see that there's a bigger picture. By the halfway mark things are beginning to add up. Then through the last half you get repeated exclamations of  HOLY CRAP THAT MOMENT WAS IMPORTANT?!  and it's really hard to quit watching. I binged the whole thing with a friend and it had us on the edge of our seats. ,3194,170,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Garo is an anime I began tentatively not entirely sure what I was getting myself into. I scanned a few reviews and saw the relativelt average scores given and wondered if it was worth spending the time to watch all 24 episodes.,3201,173,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ichigo 100% is an ecchi harem featuring some *sigh* panty shots about a boy and a few romantic interests. Viewers be warned. Also when reading the following review please take into account that I generally don't enjoy ecchi or harem anime and this will definitely affect my opinion of this anime. A few spoilers are required to explain some of the characters especially as most of the story revelations happens in the first few episodes.,3205,176,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show although dubbed as a mecha is much more largely a romance/sci-fi. I'm personally not a fan of mecha but like Code Geass I still enjoyed this thoroughly.,3223,187,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"A great story above childhood love in a surrounding that simply just does not allow children to be children. The main character  Rentin  gets thrust into a world he has been dreaming of but soon realises it is not all it was cracked up to be. He discovers Love Fear Gain and Loss Along his path but inevitably discovers himself and what he is meant to do with the love of his life. However! The person of his affections isn't quite the same. She's different and is certainly not like the others. Her story is the greatest! Like watching a blank wall become a masterpiece right in front of your eyes. ",3225,188,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Time and time again I find myself watching this anime and I can't particularly say why. The characters are great and the story is alright but it's nothing I can look at and say in particular that it's amazing. In the end I think the thing that amazes me most is the atmosphere. The setting and the phenomenal soundtrack creates a euphoric feeling for the viewer that leaves you dreaming about Eureka Seven all day long.,3226,189,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Moved from my blog (this time it was split into 3 blog posts):,3228,191,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I will admit that when I first started watching Eureka Seven I didn't think that this was going to be a series that I was going to enjoy all that much.  Probably for the sole reason that I really did not like the characters all that much.  They annoyed me to no end.  I mean sure the story seemed like it was going to be somewhat interesting and I'm always up for a good mecha but the characters just seemed to turn me off the series completely.  Though against my better judgement at the time I decided to stick with it and watch the series through to the end and I must say that this was one of the times that I was actually happy to be wrong.  The story was just about one of the best stories I had at the time ever seen.  With the series being 50 episodes long I wasn't exactly expecting a whole lot from the story.  Sure it's 50 episodes long but that's a long time for series to find a place for the story to start to drag in.  Most series that are only 20 something episodes long usually start to drag somewhere in the middle.  But thankfully Eureka Seven seems to have had found some way to avoid this from happening though I will say that there were problems with the pacing of the story that can become quite bothersome but something like that would really depend on the viewer.  Really the main thing with the story of Eureka Seven is that it seems to try to create the prefect blend of action comedy and romance to form a story that is unbelievable by all imagination.  Though this does actually end up hurting the series to a somewhat noticeable degree as the viewer in one episode is treated the fast-paced battle between mecha but then in the next episode we are left with the much slower pace of a romantic drama.  While not a major flaw with the story it can still become quite bothersome at times.  The animation as a whole still looks good even when compared to some of the things that have come out recently and really I think a person would be hard pressed to find someone who would say that it didn't to at least a small degree look quite good.  The soundtrack is definitely one of the major highlightes of the series.  With the opening and endings still even to this day being among some of my more favorite songs.  Then also considering the fact that the soundtrack seemed the fit the series prefectly always able seemingly fit the mood that the scene was trying to express.  Overall Eureka Seven is one of those series that while it may not be for everyone those who do give it enough of a chance are sure to come to enjoy it.,3229,192,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is my favorite series so expect some favortism from me on this series.,3235,197,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story: Generally the main story arc is great and interesting to watch with only a few glitches around the middle episodes where the creators seemingly pull these gigantic city destroying flying fish things out of their asses - but after this the story is explained wonderfully. However the few filler episode which they stuck in were really unnecessary - they did nothing to develop the plot and gave only minor insights into some of the characters. These episodes really should have been put to better use through expanding on the backstories of some of the characters that were only looked into during the last few episodes - or just expanding the last few episodes in general as they were quite rushed. Namely Dominic and Anemone (although her story had to be told quite late into the show to keep the tension) but there were some characters that were there just to hold places; like Woz and Jobs that deserved more.,3239,198,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Man this anime was sooo close.  It was good.  It was really good.  The animation is fun the characters are enjoyable and decently developed the soundtrack's good too the setting is fascinating and the plot is pretty cool.  Thing is in my book the thing separating an excellent show from a good one is emotional impact.  It's got to reach out and grab me shout in my ear  Feel this way!   And this show never quite made it.  Sometimes it would get close to getting my empathy but it would always fall short at the last moment usually with some cheesy lines or over-the-top scenes.  Basically it just never displayed enough maturity to really get me.  ,3250,203,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Eureka Seven truly has storytelling on it's side. The story follows a boy named Renton Thurston who is the son of his late father Adrock. He lives with his grandpa until one day a ship crashes into his house and destroys it. He falls for Eureka and joins a crew called the Gekkostate. I gotta say though the first few episodes were rather slow just focusing on Renton getting humiliated and other characters bickering. The show did start to pick up once we got to the coralian concept. And once Renton matured he became more likable. In the beginning he was one of those characters that I wanted to like but found it difficult because of his arrogance. He did learn to be more careful later though. The series honestly has some of the best animation ever. It's consistent and beautiful to watch. Then comes the characters while hard to like initially they quickly became more endearing and developed well.,3252,205,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I think of my favorite anime shows of all time only a select few come to mind and one of those is Eureka Seven. I stumbled upon this anime a few weeks ago and am extremely glad that I decided to give it a shot despite some of the negative reviews some people had about it. Eureka Seven is one of the best anime I have seen in awhile because of the intense action strong characters and the ongoing romance between Renton and Eureka especially.,3258,208,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'll admit; I saw this five episode OVA series after I had already watched seasons 1-3.  However it was still entertaining though that just made the two-parter easier to predict.  After I saw the OVA I felt that season three is somewhat of an expansion of the two-parter which had introduced the king of Small Shimeron.,3270,216,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The anime starts off great and ends great but in the middle its kind of weird in that you feel that some of the episodes are insignificant to the progressive story line and for a little while I wondered if this series was episodic instead of progressive.

Why are aliens so attracted to Earth? It's a question that many fans of science fiction have pondered at one time or another and there have been a number of different answers - vacations natural resources food and water building a hyperspace by-pass enslaving the population experiments and general curiosity (to name a few). Of all the possible explanations though boredom and baseball are two that probably wouldn't spring to mind.,3278,224,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you remember ever having a 'Ken' doll when you were a kid you can picture exactly what every character in this anime has in the downstairs department. As in nothing. It's actually quite amusing at first. I kept seeing the characters on a box with 'Bobbie and Ken' written in pink over them. As a result it was kind of weird to watch though it does have a very cute ending. However I wasn't sure about the method of pick-up; it was pretty much  I've been kicked out of my apartment can I stay with you?   Sure  then the sex commences. I don't think it works like that in the real world but that's the beauty of yaoi no?,3281,227,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Legend of the Galactic Heroes is one of the longest anime I know of and the longest I have watched in it's entirety. It is a highly rated series and before tackling it I had yet to see a single poor review. Now I understand why. It seems only scifi junkies(such as ones who find themselves intruiged with star wars/Trek just on the merit they are in space) tend to complete the series and others drop it so immediately it's not worth endowing with a review.,3288,231,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Some toes may be stepped on here but not on purpose. The animation is pretty good and I rate style not quality so as to be fair to older anime as older or newer is not necessarily better. The soundtrack is made up of classical music and original songs which are in English because it's the language the Alliance use I guess but the show mainly focuses on the Empire ah whatever. As with most music I find classical to be mainly either mediocre or crap and unlike some I fail to see how liking this music in any way automatically makes you smarter surely liking music that does have singing would make one smarter because there's more to take in? Sure there's Slob On My Knob by The Three Six Mafia but there's also the Immanuel Kant Song. I've already pointed out why I'm opposed to anything except a system of government where the candidate who got the most right answers on the 1000 question test gets to rule until at least the next years' selection process (oh I know nobody supports this but at first everybody thought washing one's hands wasn't a good idea as well) so it should come as no surprise that I can't support either side whether it's the Empire who enslave captured populations or the Free Planets Alliance whose public services are useless and whose economy is inferior (at one point in the show it was stated that the economic balance of power was Empire 5 FPA 4 Phezzan 1 while nominally part of the Empire Phezzan runs itself). While running from 1988-1997 its future was pretty accurate to a degree; people have indeed turned away from religion and towards alcohol and mysticism and things haven't gotten any better. Don't get me wrong I'm hardly indifferent on the subject* but if there's one thing I've learned from experience it's that people believe in or doubt what's convenient to themselves no matter what the subject in question is** (like in England how the poor north votes Labour and the rich south Conservative) and that people who claim to be religious are only in it for the notion of Heaven and really don't know if God exists (I ask the people who think that all religious people are fundamentalists how the majority of people could be a part of a religion whose sacred text says  thou shalt not fornicate with man nor beast  yet virtually everybody does anyway? The fundamentalists aren't truly religious either the Bible says do unto others... and not think anybody is inferior) people who are atheists*** are in it for the idea that you can do whatever you want because we'll all end up the same anyway and think that just because the majority are such morons that they're automatically smart for being the minority and even act like they hate God but they don't know if He exists either and people who are agnostic are the real atheists they just don't have the courage to admit it even to themselves (whenever a debate was taking place I have always seen the self-proclaimed agonstics taking the atheists' side) and that people are only into spirituality for the idea that you can do this easy stuff and things will go fine right away. I've seen all of this for myself and this being the internet and everybody being from the anglosophere and thus an empiricist anybody disagreeing with me has already lost. While I've got little positive to say about South Park one thing it did get right was that if religion was eliminated there would still be war over politics (I would add and land and money how else do you suppose Catholics and Protestants lived together in harmony in every other country in Europe in the late 1900's but not in Northern Ireland where there was discrimination in houses jobs and votes?) In Legend Of The Galactic Heroes religion is near nonexistent and yet there's been constant war for over a century anyway true the Terraists have infiltrated both sides but nobody agrees with them apart from their own members both sides are in the fight for their politics and nothing else. One of the best things about the show is its attempt at being very realistic but that's a double-edged sword. On the one hand it's admirable for an anime of all things to try to be accurate but becuase of this you get people who like it because of that reason alone; it tries to be smart so people think liking it automatically makes them smart (see also the Evangelion and Ghost In The Shell franchises) and throw in classical music and you've got some prime snob bait right there. People who like this show (on other websites) have snobbily and passive aggressively compared it to the Gundam franchise in a way that's demenaing to the Gundam franchise but the thing is the Gundam franchise does exactly what it sets out to do; be halfway realistic and therefore not asking the viewer to suspend their disbelief and halfway fantastical so as to interest the viewer and this is why the Gundam franchise is so popular. Legend Of The Galactic Heroes tries to go for full on realism but stops a fair bit short of this with the one thing apart from unlikable characters (not just on ideological grounds; there's nothing likable about them apart from Hildegard and Annerose who are nice people there's also the fact that von Oberstein is a machiavellian Bittenfeld is reckless and actually more harm than good but never gets sacked and so on) which holds it back from being a masterpiece as opposed to just a good anime; it's set in the future but they parade around the battlefield like it's the 1800's. I know roriconfan has attempted to just dismiss this enormous flaw out of hand as (I paraphrase)  there's something in the outer space settlements which means they have to fight in close formation  well yes but why would anybody build something that would make them fight this way? It's not to either side's advantage and using tactics centuries old is surely a disadvantage to both sides if anything. Technology moves ever forward sure Napoleon brough back the cuirass to great effect but that didn't stop the constantly improving firearms technology from making mounted troops obsolete eventually. The quicker weapons can be fired the more the soldiers spread out so as to minimise the amount of people who all get hit from the same shell and so on so if anything in the future the weapons would be faster not slower (the LOGH ships fire at the rate of a sniper rifle but at pistol range proportionately speaking) so the formations would be looser and not tighter. roriconfan pointed out in his review that LOGH portrays religion as evil but I counter that there's only one religion shown in the show and it's a religion that it's speculated people would have not one that anybody has now so it's not anti-all religons any more than Nineteen Eighty Four is a criticism of the entire left wing and not just the far left (I know George Orwell was a socialist but I'm not saying LOGH is pro- other religions either.) Oh boy am I religious (I see this as a duty and not something to be proud of and I haven't been the best Christian) and oh boy is roriconfan an atheist and oh boy do I disagree with him 40% of the time (yes 40 you did read that right) so how on Earth (ho ho!) can we both like the same show? For different reasons obviously.,3292,233,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In my opinion Night Head Genesis is simply not worth watching. Too many flaws. The plot is extremely confusing and confused there are plot holes which span miles a load of inconsistencies clichèd dialogues and a terrible pacing. The characters leave much to be desired too. The animation is ok but nothing special: movements are rigid and in several occasions the scenes lack details and completion. The two main characters are drawn well enough even though it's one of those anime where the characters never ever change their clothes. As for the background music I found it really creepy: it helped to create a weird and dark atmosphere. Voice-acting isn't that good; especially Naoya's repetitive cry:  Nii-san tasketè!!!!  is extremely off-putting - thankfully he stops doing it a certain point.,3302,241,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Night Head Genesis is one of those series that carries the potential to become great but yet somehow ends up mediocre. The story focuses on the two brothers Naoto and Naoya who were born with psychic powers and were thus locked away from society for 15 years until they finally managed to escape. The first half which focuses on Naoto and Naoya trying to recover their lost past is thus quite engaging and interesting and it helps the viewers to understand the characters better. However from this point onward Night Head Genesis rapidly takes a turn towards the worse and steadily progresses from being midly interesting and quite engaging to downright bad.,3303,242,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I honestly dont understand the hype about this. Most people consider this the best horror series around but I find it way inferior compared to others(Ghost Hunt Shiki). Its a pretty tipical case. Black Butler has the same sindrome(at least the first few episodes do). We get 18 minutes of useless boring stuff just to get 2-3 minutes of awesomeness. I understand the concept. They show us a friendly everyday place with everyday people this creates a comfortable kind of atmosphere. Thus the few minutes in which we experience genuine terror have a much greater effect then they should. My biggest problem is that the series doesnt seem to speed up at all. I was expecting the creators to drop the act after a few episodes. For example we have Shiki. They start out the same way. Mostly friendly with small portions of terror but after the first few episodes even if thing dont evolve too fast they drop the act. This is one of my problems. You get too much filler in every episode and too little  action . 4/10,3324,256,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After I watched some of my first horror shows I kept seeing the word  Higurashi  just SOMEWHERE everyday. And I never really picked up on it because not as many people saw it as I thought.

Although I had low expectation from this anime I ended up loving it! The storyline is amazing with great plot. You should not let thet fact that you understand nothing in the beginning let you down. The first episode might not be promising but after a couple more you most propably get stuck with it. Higurashi no nako koro ni tries to pass deeper meanings such as the bi-dimensionality of time.,3329,261,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh Higurashi... how you open with a thunderbolt and then clear skies soon after making one wonder if it was all but a dream. And then it's back in moderation steadily growing until it reaches the climax of the storm and just as before clears up but not without the last laugh the final hurrah only to return later. That's essentially Higurashi or the progression of it. It starts off with a scene and then transforms into comedy. The comedy lasts for a while but turns into something monstrous wrought with suspense and horror. It's brilliant simply so. How it mixes two genres and the switch between them is one of my favorite aspects of this anime.,3334,263,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If this is your first time reading anything up on this anime and you haven't had the pleasure to view it yet I strongly suggest you stop looking and just see the anime. Trust me going in blind is the best way to watch this one. You're welcome... Now onto the review...,3335,264,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love Higurashi. It's a very interesting anime. As opposed to just reviewing Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (When They Cry) I'd like to review Higurashi as a whole. The reason being that while it is a very enjoyable anime/manga as a stand-alone series you can't fully appreciate it (or even comprehend it) without watching it's relations Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei as well.,3345,267,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As this is one of my on-going anime series' I'm watching I'm a little worried. I'm sixteen episodes in and I still have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on. The time jumps confuse me. After the first arc ends with Kei violently smashing in the girls' heads and clawing out his own throat the second arc begins with them all suddenly alive again. And then the plot focuses on people dying in different ways. And other people completely. And some arcs seem to happen years before the first. And some arcs only have one or two main characters in. It's so random! However I think I kind of get some of what is happening. In the village there is a curse that supposedly kills one person and makes another disappear once a year on the night of some local festival. And it's about that. But it's hard to distinguish if the curse is a genuine curse or if it's actually some kind of criminal ring or if it's all in the characters' heads. Which keeps me very interested.,3361,276,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (known to fans simply as 'Higurashi') is without doubt one of the best shows I have ever seen. The show takes place in the small fictional town of Hinamizawa where on the same day every year for the past five years someone has been found dead and another person has gone missing. Is it just coincidence or are the villagers hiding dark and murderous secrets? The show is divided into several different and seemingly unrelated arcs called chapters. Each chapter takes place around the same fateful day of the same year but each is a different re-telling of it where different characters are killed in different gruesome ways. As the chapters progress we discover more and more about the mysterious murders and the twisted characters commiting them.,3367,280,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is just basically used to narrow down the story. They reviewed the first half when L was still alive using L as a narrator.

Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (Season 1) Review,3403,307,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Tsubasa and I have a love hate relationship. I love the characters music storyline art everything except for the fact that it ended before coming to a conclusion. I carried on to watch the ovas and still annoyed with the lack of conclusion. It leaves you with some questions answered and more to be answered. Although I didn’t really care as much about Sakura as I feel they wanted us to I loved and I do mean loved Syaoran. He is probably the dream guy to every girl who wants a knight in shining armor. He gives up everything for the girl he loves (Sakura) and without even hesitating. Which is why the lack of ending bothered me. I mean what does he get for his troubles? He travels through time and space to collect Sakuras memories for her knowing he will be cut out of each and every one of them. I wanted to bawl for him and give him a hug. Talk about the short end of the stick. He's selfless and strong and honorable and honestly I am sounding like a fan girl but that's okay because if anyone deserves tons of fan girls it is definitely him. Sakura isn't as strong a character but hey she loses all her memories and is kind of just a shell for part of it so let's face it its kind of hard to get attached to her until closer to the end. Overall it's an epic story that doesn’t have much in the way of an ending (I have started in on the manga to hopefully solve that issue) but is worth the time it takes to watch it. It'll make you laugh it'll make you cry. It is definitely one of my all time favorites.

First animated transposition of the manga I've first seen these OVA only recently long after I've seen the more recent anime series. This might somehow influence my judgement (toward a more positive value probably) but I'll try to stick to what I actually think of these 5 OVAs as a standalone thing.

I gave this a 2.5. Not only on this review but on my own personal page. I did so because I found this little extra tid-bit to be only slightly entertaining but it got quite old after the first few. If you are a die-hard K-On! fan you may enjoy it but I personally found it lacking in not only the humor that the series is known for but in the animation style. It's suppose to be that way all cute and what-not... but it just looks as if a 10 year old drew the entire thing. Overall as I said if you liked the series you may wanna give this a try but don't expect to really enjoy it as much as you would a new episode of the series.,3427,321,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Only just watched this and as much as I long for series that last at least 30+ it didn't really bother me to much because it was good enough for me too watch in an entire day. It's very grotesque with a lot of dark things popping up throughout. The ending isn't clear and leaves people to believe what they want although personally I'd rather know what happened. Although Lucy did a lot of horrible things I still hoped she could end up living like a normal person. The only main problem I have with the series is not all the characters get enough of a role and we don't know enough about them so we don't understand the motives behind everything.,3434,327,2019-04-13 21:35:40

 I'd heard a lot of positive reviews on this anime so I decided to check it out for myself and I couldn't agree more the story is extremely interesting and there's quite a variety of different characters. I enjoyed the gore but even without it it's still a really enjoyable plot.,3438,331,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,3439,332,2019-04-13 21:35:40
SUBARASHII Anime !!!! Loved it. It was a painfully dramatic and tragic love story in a bloody storm. Which in my opinion ended wonderfully when all the misteries were clear to the main characters and all the situations found their solve. NYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!,3442,333,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I tried to stick to exact numbers here but it feels like i'm not giving enough credit to the series only giving it 9. The twisted vision of alien life an amazing and gripping series that unfolds the lost memories of Lucy a doomed individual. One of the best anime ive seen. The revelations may or may not be expected but the severity and the heart warming heart breaking happenings are just....vectorlicious,3446,335,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This series is NSFW that for sure i loved every moment of it the characters were amazing to me the story itself had me like What the actual F$#^ I recommend this series to anyone who is in to blood and gore and just a good story but be warned don't watch it at work it's too gory,3447,336,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story: Built up to the right points on most things. I felt though on some points the story confused you to much or gave you to much to where you knew exactly what happened. In my opinion i would rather be surprise then knowing what was going to happen before it happened. For the most part though the story kept you hooked. It was on point. The ending frustated me so so much though but still such a good story line.,3448,337,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a great anime. If you can get past the gore and language then this is a great anime to watch. It mixes a lot of themes that you would not normally see in an anime. It is a must watch.,3455,342,2019-04-13 21:35:40
By far one of the best anime Iv'e ever seen. It hs a great story with twist both good and sad OMG moments aswell as moments where u wanna cry. The characters are great and the music fits so well I love the intro and even learned out to play it on guitar.,3456,343,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is without a doubt the most sickening and screwed up anime ever to be published... im only on the third episode and its already proved how dark a story it is,3457,344,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,3458,345,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was one of the first anime I watched. I bought the box set for a holiday in France although it was very hard to watch in front of my parents and little brother because of all the female nudity so if you aren't into that don't watch it. I absolutely loved it; it was violent exciting bizarre quirky and cool. The romance sub-plot was good for once and it really did work with the story line. I loved the character designs especially Lucy's. The music was brilliant - the opening song Lilium sung by Kumiko Noma is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard although it sends me to sleep pretty much immediately if I hear it.,3460,346,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Elfen Lied is a very psychological anime and contains a lot of graphic violence (blood and gore).  There is near nudity throughout the series therefore it's for mature audiences only.,3461,347,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Elfen Lied is a prime example of an anime that owes it's generally good scores solely to hype. People like it because they are told they will like it. It's a phenomena which though it occurs in other cases truly shines through with this anime above all others.,3464,350,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,3465,351,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ah Elfen Lied. This one has an interesting public view. Seems people either love it or hate it I rarely see a middle ground. The first thing I want to address is you should avoid being put off by the immediate appearence. It is very simple to look at it and figure that it is just based off pointless nudity and violence. If you are able to sit down and give it a chance you quickly see there are reasons for what happens and things that guide it beyond pure shock value. Don't get me wrong I am sure a lot of it is in for shock value but there is at least a story attached to it.,3466,352,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Really nice anime one of my favorites. Draw quality is what bothers me most especially on those purple and brunette haired girls they all look too similar. Nana and Number 3 looked exact same and same thing with Yuka and Mayu while Lucy Kurama Shirakawa and Mariko looked much better like there was some real effort on them while those first 4 felt like sloppy work imo.,3475,360,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Truly one of the best anime series that i have watched. I loved the theme of the story how it transitioned from being light hearted to dark. Just like a great book the anime starts off with a hook that grabbed my attention right away. The only part that got to me was that it had to end.,3479,362,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Basically I told to watch this... without reading the plot... and knowing the genres... SO I DIDNT KNOW that there would be gore and blood and horrific scenes so that’s one of the reasons why it has such a kind of low rating. ,3482,365,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First comment i have ever left on a anime (new to this ) but loved the story such great twists and great charachter detail :) this anime is defo worth watching i thouh because of the tags it would be way too much of the bad for me but defo a amazing anime !  give it a shot :),3483,366,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I first started to watch this anime I thought it was kind of weird- and it still is.  I'm not a big fan of blood and gore but for some reason I couldn't stop watching this anime once I started.  I don't remember much of what happened all I know is that it was a pretty good anime.  So if you don't mind bloody stuff then I say give this anime a shot!,3493,372,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In this corrupt and cruel world we live in lies a predjudice racist abusive and overall an evil society which judges you and beats you down for who you are. Elfen Lied deals with all of these themes in a very dark and straigt foward way exposing the true nature we live in. If some one looks or acts different we shun them just to fit in with the crowd so we too will not be harmed. Experience the journey of Elfen Lied through Lucy's Kouta's and many other characters eyes as we see how the world treats those who are different. Elfen Lied takes a more serious and abbrasive apporach to the subject through symbolism and dark methods such as human experimentation and murder so make sure you are ready for the dark tragedy that Elfen Lied is.,3497,374,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well well... As you can see I haven't enjoyed this story as much as all the other people. I've been looking forward to seeing it since I was on 5th grade of primary school however with the first episodes arrived a dash of disappointment which had been growing minute by minute. If I was to point out the cons of this anime it would most certainly be the level of remission and compassion between the characters or the unrealistic amount of blood involved in every  gotta kill em all  scene. But since it's animated and I'm more into happier or more psychological kind of anime I wouldn't dare to blame it for that. As for the remission and compassion I mentioned above I really feel like Kohta (the main character) is just so caring that it is almost unbelievable. Well I wouldn't ever fogive someone who killed my family even if the person would be in some kind of rage that he doesn't know about. The creators of this anime probably wanted to condone Nyu's/Lucy's (the second main character's) actions but I somehow failed to agree with it. In fact I wanted her to kill everyone from the corporation where she was kept in as a  guinea-pig  (well in the end it wasn't like that actually) and then kill herself because that seemed like the only possible solution. Everything started going in some other direction  though. Overall it was woth watching but if you are looking for some soothing anime I do not recommend watching this one. Unfortunately this is just my opinion so you'll have to watch it yourself. (^_^),3507,382,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was amazing up until the conclusion which was utter garbage rarely will I love a show so much and be able to be so disgusted by it so that whenever I hear someone talk about it I have to restrain myself from venting about how shitty it is.,3508,383,2019-04-13 21:35:40

the FIRST anime i ever watched and im not one for brutal violence im gorephobic but despite the intense violence within the scenes of this anime hides a golden show with amazing story and characters that you just cant help but either care for or despise the story was great and kept me wanting to see more and more and within a day i had watched this entire series that brought me into anime. ive rarely seen an anime with such violence have good story but this one was amazing and the ending was phenominal in the way it brought out many emotions in me as i watched it i dont think ive ever felt such a mixture of emotion as i watched an anime how ever some characters i didnt exactly find fond in the fact they were just kinda annoying besides that great anime,3519,393,2019-04-13 21:35:40
-Story-,3522,394,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty much right from the start it is full of   Holy Sh!t  moments every couple minutes. Mostly from the Extreme Gore. Emotional it many many ways. It leaves you with a deep feeling that you can't really categorize or understand. In order to feel the full effect I would watch it all the way through like I did though it is definitley a very hard show to swallow all at once and is not for the faint of heart. Rated only a 8 because my feelings still confuse me. I loved it but didn't find myself say how awesome it was. Instead it made me think and reflect which is in its own right is a great quality. On a side note the open ending really messed with my feelings angry -> sad -> happy -> really really sad -> hopeful -> then credits ... I would love to think that is Lucy seeing as in both ending fights she lost her horns so the shadow could in fact be her.,3525,395,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the best animes I've ever watched. Story and plot are amazing. It combines innocence with strong violence almost perfectly. It is very gory but only when it has to; Amimation is of great detail. A must watch anime.,3526,396,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,3527,397,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Let's be clear on this one. One of the reasons I dislike this anime may be because it made me face the horrible realisation that I might just be too old for it (I'm 26 so maybe 14 years too old).,3529,398,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I know there are fans of this anime but I really can't relate.  The show wasn't really exciting or addictive whatsoever.  There is NO character development and NO music aside from the intro and credits.  The plot always moves too fast or too slow.  Also the constant nudity and excessive gore got boring fast.  As in the gore is just depressing to watch(e.g. man begging for his life but getting slowly dismembered anyway.  Actually I think that really happened in the show).  Did not enjoy so I dropped it after a few episodes.,3530,399,2019-04-13 21:35:40
(Going to try and keep all my reviews Short)     (And probably Vague),3531,400,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My first anime series ever (Other than Pokemon). I've seen a few movies but this was my first television piece...and it was an absolutely gorgeous piece of art. I'm a bit embarrassed to say I haven't read the manga yet but the show is lovely. I was emotionally invested in the characters and loved how the plot unfolded over these 13 episodes. Yes the story was slightly repetitive towards the end and there was a little confusion here and there but the arc was so well thought out and strong that these small critiques didn't matter. I thought the violence was awesome and added to the overall story. Sadly I watched it in English(Netflix) dubbed and it wasnt great so I need to make another round with the subs. Overall beautiful as I said and I adored the tragically moving ending. This is probably the saddest (TV anime) I've seen yet so bravo for giving me a bit of a cry.,3532,401,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story is messed up but good. What this anime is about: Powers boobs blood guts incest. I actully hate the ending because there is no second season. I guess I'll have to read the manga.,3533,402,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It was good. Had its dramatic scenes and good story but most of characters were really annoying. The sound was perfect and and animation okay.,3534,403,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"This movie is one of my favorites. Mew is so cute and brutal all at the same time haha. The show has a very good story line which tells about how she is being treated and whatnot. In a way some people can relate to her because everyone feels that they are different. ",3536,405,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For one I love the absolute shit out of this anime but I have mixed feelings about it. Frustration sadness you name it. This Anime was the anime that got me started. And now that I gone a little more into it Some of it is amazing some of it is garbage.,3537,406,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Don't watch this anime for the blood do not watch it for the nudity watch it because you can find out how much suffering people in this world can be exposed to. Watch it because it shows how all suffering derives and can be solved only from/with other people. Just look at how those people see the possibility of happienes what happieness is to them and aditionaly how they dealt with their pain.,3538,407,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So I've cried at the end of episode 13 It is worth watching but it would be great if the Arms studios would do a recap  of this anime with a season 2 or just making season 2 of this anime.So this anime can be reborn with a new fresh look and updating the caracter models  and then it will have some potential .

A very gruesome anime a lot of gore in it for sure. But I definitely still enjoyed it. The tragic parts are what got to me and the characters were great it made me feel so bad for them. The only problem I did have with this anime was the weird romance the main character had with his cousin... I thought it was a little odd but despite that I still give it a nice rating (: ,3551,418,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"In the first episode of Elfen Lied Lucy is pretty naked through the whole episode until she meets Kouta and Yuka at a beach. Of course in any anime I've watched there is always someone who loses their memory or can't talk and Lucy is both. Since she can't talk and the thing she says is  Nyuu  Kouta and Yuka names her  Nyuu . ",3553,419,2019-04-13 21:35:40

To start this review off I am going to say that I am giving this anime a completely blunt and honest review. This is strictly MY opinions and MY thoughts.

This anime truly has a great story and I would reccommend it to anyone who wants to have a thrill out of watching anime but this anime is very upseting at times so I wouldn't watch it if you can't handle a bit of gore and brutality!,3565,429,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really like the first season of Swort Art Online! Unfortunatelly this 'new Extra Edition' is most of all a summary of what happend... Quit boring because the real serie is really better has a better story and shows the Characters better ^^. But the actual new part is cool not perfect but I like it :). So most of the Score is for the 'new part' not the repeating part.,3595,454,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It was nice but I recommend watching the original. This was more like a recap of what happened before. The original was more emotional and just left you wanting more. Like...a snicker doodle cookie that's so good when it's go you're upset. This one was kinda boring and didn't have that much excitement for me.,3596,455,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before you watch this it is imparitive to have watched the show first. You will jip yourself of all the emotion an beauty of the story if you don't. Honestly for a fan it's cool to see some extra scenes and things like that but these we're sort of useless. The movie is an hour and 20 minutes of  previously on  and its kind of a waste of time. It highlights certain things and the characters are all back to tell the story but you're seriously better off just leaving it be. The last 20 minutes are new and basically give you a bit of filler to hold you over for the new season. Though they may have given us a glimpse of a new villain or two!,3597,456,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really disappointed with this extra edition it basically summed up the two series in 100 minutes with only 10 minutes of new animation and story overall really boring. It didn't answer any  real questions but just repeated already what we knew.,3599,457,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's amazing how much of a story you can tell without words. While everything about Anemone may seem confusing and surreal for the first minute or so by the end everything is very powerful. I'd give you a summary of the story but if I did then it would spoil the ending.,3600,458,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I liked this show alot had a well rounded enough storyline the character list wasn't too impressive but there was a good amount of ones that people would like the action was alright with pretty funny comedy in between the graphics is very colorful.It was a fun experience and anybody can enjoy it in my opinion but if you are looking for something with outstanding fighting scenes this is not exactly the greatest and they didn't really last too long but it was good I feel as it could've grown to be great if they added more to it but it was ended to short.,3620,470,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ao No Exorcist on the surface a fairly predictable supernatural anime.  Delinquent teenager boy discovers he is the son of Satan decides to become an exorcist after an untimely tragedy caused by his demon father.  The majority of this anime so far deals with the boy's school life in Exorcist cram school all in a fairly Harry Potter-esque manner.  The characters are all very standardized types and their interaction is more or less predictable.  So why do I recommend this?  Despite it's predictable elements it is in fact very entertaining.  Especially if you're looking for something easy to get into it even has a few good laughs in it.  I look forward to next week's episode.,3622,471,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I dont enjoy when they kill off a character so early in the story but this one it was needed to develop the main character and fordge the story to continue into the main plot.,3626,474,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okumura Rin is the typical male shounen lead. He is boisterous and not the sharpest tool in the shed. But what he lacks in intelligence discipline and overall awkwardness he makes up for with his firey spirit and complete sincereity. It is also in some ways a typical  magic-shool  genre. But it has themes such as the importance of friendship overcoming obstacles(no matter how impossible they seem) understanding others and giving life your all. It has an interesting group of characters. It kind of reminded me of Inuyasha in some ways. I felt like it could have used a second season. But I confused the OVA for a season 2 so DON'T DO THAT! But all in all it was an enjoyable experience!,3627,475,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay! I new this anime is totally new at least when I'm writing this it is but I had to write a review.,3635,480,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Beautiful art wonderful storyline and completely addictive characters. Being the son of Satan trying to live in the human world can't be easy but Rin handles it admirably well with a big attitude and strong determination. I love Rin and I routed for him the whole time to become the ultimate exorcist to kill his own father because let's face it Satan is always bad. Well not so easy and not so simple. The world and reasoning's behind everything are not what they seem and many twists and turns are taken before he and his friends can find a balance. The characters weren't all cookie cutter always a good start and they progress as individuals growing as they learn and experience things outside their spectrum of normal. There's cute characters theirs bada** characters and many others. There are endearing moments and awesome fights. It has great sound great art and progressed perfectly. It was one of my favorite animes for the season and overall.,3636,481,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ao no Exorcist is one of those shows you will either hate or love without much of a middle ground. The reason for this division of opinion is the amount of shounen cliche that makes up roughly 80% of the story.,3641,486,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really loved this anime to be honest. I was hooked from episode one and I binge watched my way through it on Netflix.,3649,493,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I enjoyed Ao No Exorcist because it is a refreshingly polished and fun action anime that also has the ability to be serious which it uses to great effect. To start I wanna talk about our main character Rin. Now Rin is an orphan raised in a monastery who has a problem getting into fights in the neighborhoods earning him a reputation as a delinquent and he certainly looks surly enough to fit the part. But actually (not so) deep down he’s a big softie and a great cook! Seriously what more could you want. This sets the tone for the rest of the characters and their interactions. As we find out more about his unfortunately satanic parentage and the new world of demons and familiars that’s been opened up he shows depth and a healthy dose of character growth alongside his team of teenage oddballs while they work towards climbing the ladder towards their chosen exorcist-flavored career path. The animation is lovely the sound is awesome (Rin’s voice actor stands out as a favorite of mine) and overall it is an engaging and well put together show that I have recommended to friends and will continue to do for some time.,3652,494,2019-04-13 21:35:40

*There might be some spoilers in this review.  I apologize in advance* I liked the anime in overall  the exorcist against the Satan and the demons and everything  but... The Gates of Hell shooting out the laser beams?  Seriously? The characters were hilarious and the anime was good. But I just couldn't cope with the story of The Mother/Satan relationship.  Even though I love fast paced story lines the last few episodes passed by quickly.  Too quickly. And the Principal? Solo very much shady dude. Not like The Principal in the Vampire Knight.  That one was whimpy.,3668,504,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Blue Exorcist is number one my favorite series of all time. Both the anime and manga are great. At first I did not like the anime after watching the first few minutes. It was random and very wired and kinda of scary. I gave up on the anime for a while. But later on I skip the 1st epsiode and watched  the 2nd epsiode and seriously  not kidding it changed my life. Reasons why Blue Exorcist is so great.,3670,506,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:The very first episodes of Ao No Exorcist (( Blue Exorcist )) were what really got me in to the series. Blue Exorcist is about a Kid/Teenager Named Rin the character has a hard time trying to control his anger. One day (( No spoilers )) He figures out that he is the son of satan. He didn't know because they never really told him anyway; Rin's brother  Yukio  does know but didn't inherit the blue flames. I'm not going to spoil much but you'll have to watch the anime to know,3671,507,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sub-par. You'd be better off watching Hunter x Hunter,3672,508,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was what got me back into watching anime after I took a LONGGG break from it. I loved watching it but I think I'll read the manga. Just to see if I missed anything that wasn't included in the anime. The anime is full of action and adventure. It's amazing. i honestly don't know what to say about it. I'm usually someone who watches/read Shoujo but stuff like this I can deal with. I love both of the genres a lot so I have no complaints. Again fantastic anime and I'm sure you'll love watching as much as I did.,3673,509,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'd honestly would say this is one of the best animes of 2011. Its not everyday you'll find such great anime with spectaluar animation! Of coures the story might not be very original as ive seen other animes and shows with such close stories the characters and intense action keep it very intrugiating! i'd say blue exorcist is one of my all time favorite animes and hope for a second season along with a great 2012 movie which is coming soon! :D,3674,510,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Blue Exorcist is more of a slice of life than anything else. If you're not a fan of that then please don't let the  shounen  tag trick you like it did me. ,3675,511,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Blue Exorcist or Ao no Exorcist came out this year (spring 2011) and was one of the big suprises for me this year. We almost hit the end of this year and i have to say that in my opinion this is one of the best shows of this year. Let me explain why;,3676,512,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really had high hopes for this after watching the first couple episodes but it really wasn't that great. The artwork was nice and the idea behind the story was great but the story itself was lacking. I feel like there was a lack of development in fighting and the characters. Many times there were repeated scenes of characters saying  I thought I told you to believe in me  or  You're not the only one  yet they never failed to revert back to old habits throughout the whole thing. ,3679,513,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime has some serious flaws. Some of them worse than I've ever seen. But I still quite enjoyed this anime. So for those of you discouraged and wondering if it's worth watching I want to pose a different view from the hate it's gotten so far and explain how I enjoyed it.,3683,516,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's amazing how such a short anime can be so boring and lack any sort of essence. And yet I look at such long animes like bleach naruto dragonball and they have so many interesting stories. Why did they even bother to animate this?,3684,517,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'm not usually a fan of games made anime. However I actually enjoyed this one.,3686,519,2019-04-13 21:35:40
               I first saw this anime posted on Facebook.  I looked at the picture of the main character read the title and thought  Why Not It looks interesting.  I know the old saying  Don't judge a book by its cover.   But sometimes you have little else to go on when looking for new anime to watch. ,3689,520,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Alright this is definitely worth your while if you're looking for some sort of good fantasy themed anime animation and effects are really bringing it up.,3704,527,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To be honest the only good thing about this show was the opening and they changed it midway so make that nothing........the story is about a freakishly calm guy named Kakeru and his whiny loli cliche girlfriend named Yuka Minase. Then there's characters like Kaori and Tadashi that are there just to give you a sense of reality which though I admired that wasn't enough to get this show back on its feet. The animation was pretty bad but after watching fantastic shows with bad animation such as Higurashi I can vouch for that. Then there's the actual storyline.........with lack of a better way to say it it was terrible. It just was. The idea was pretty unoriginal and kinda cheesy to be honest. Anyways back to the characters. There are some pretty interesting characters in this show. Their personalities vary which is a good thing but all throughout the show I was expecting this clever twist that would make the show shine but it never came.  Some of the characters were pretty........odd. Most of them had pretty much no purpose and the ones that did were just plain out annoying (especially Yuka.) Misuzu: First time I found a red-haired anime character below perfect. So I give this show a 3.21 because it's utter shit. Sorry to those of you that like this anime but I believe it sucks. ,3705,528,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"11eyes is a psychological horrorscape. An action packed decent into madness that leaves one with more questions then answers. ",3726,538,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I must confess I didn't want to see it at first but when I saw the red night at the opening I said well lets give it a chance and at first NOTHING has sense and it looks like another typical anime where there's a boy who likes a girl and tries to protect her from the evil to eventually fall in the need to save humanity. ,3727,539,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is not very good because it does not have a very good story line. The story line of the anime kind of jumps between two different wrolds and sometimes that can be confusing for some people but sometimes it has a good story line to it. The animation of the anime is kind of good. The animation of the two different worlds is good but some of the animation on the characters is not as great as I thought it should be but the animation on them is still good in someway. The songs that are in the anime are kind of wierd but there are a couple that are good. I like aobut one or two characters the most in this anime because they are just awesome people but the others I find a little wierd. ,3728,540,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The plot attempts to follow a horror mystery formula of sorts. It mostly fails. There is not enough clues in the earlier episodes to guess the series development later on and the horror of the ominous red night wears off quickly leaving a good guys vs. bad guys set up. There is not enough to either to like or hate them. The ending is disappointing as well.,3735,544,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was um… very different. The panty shots got out of handnd the story go lame pretty fast as well. Then there came yandere Yuka holyoley was that a laughing fest. Overall there really isn’t much to say about 11eyes other then it progressively became worse with a very lame happy ending.,3738,547,2019-04-13 21:35:40
During the first couple episodes I watched I originally thought that the concept story and character design had the potential to be at the very least an amazing show. However as the  story  progresses the story's very foundation began to crumble. The fact that they tried to fit everything into 12 episodes made it extremely difficult not to rush the ending and the results showed. They could've easily dragged this to at least 24 episodes made the story develop at a much less hastened pace and all the while keeping the story interesting. In the end though what's done is done. The hastened ending of the show ended up crippling 11eyes potential for epicness. The kindest verdict I could give the show is 7/10.,3743,548,2019-04-13 21:35:40
11eyes is amazing! The only reasons it gets a 9 and not a 10 from me it's because i was waiting a different ending and what actually happened was a bit disappointing...,3744,549,2019-04-13 21:35:40
11eyes is a fantasy action anime with minimal ecchi elements in the usual done-to-death highschool setting. I hate ecchi so I prepared myself with some booze expecting the worst. Despite my low expectations this anime actually appeared to have a proper plot and a therefore reason to watch it. The start is slow and lacking but it picks up so don't drop it early. Give this a try if you like this genre/type of story and don't mind a little ecchi. And even if you don't then at least try the soundtrack which is the best bit. It really isn't half bad.,3745,550,2019-04-13 21:35:40
NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS SHOW,3747,551,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you're looking for an anime with great plot storyline and development don't get your hopes up with Glasslip.,3750,552,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay could someone please explain to me what I just watched? I have one word for this anime that I was really excited to see too: confusing. From beginning to end I wasn't able to understand a single thing that was going on. It should have been basic a basic romance but it turned into a confusing supernatural series of episodes that ended in the same question that it had when it began. Perhaps someone will see this and explain to me exactly what was happening. I have tried to piece everything together but I suspect I'll get a headache if I try too hard. So I'm done. Done. It's finito for me here. ,3751,553,2019-04-13 21:35:40

To me the only thing going for this show is the animation and music which is good but the story is rather impossible to follow. I cannot express how often this show has left me confused about the happenings. From what I gather the show is about dealing with teenage angst romance etc. without all of the T.V tropes one might see with this kind of show. I wouldn't watch this again it's too much of a headache.,3755,556,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I''s Pure has a typical theme.  An indecisive man going after the (what I assume) most popular girl in school.  Through miss-understand after miss-understanding the male lead try time and time again to confess his deep and undying love for this perfect girl.  His pessimistic attitude towards it all leads to some honest drama as their emotions we would all honestly feel in his shoes.  With the help of his great friend he is continuously given chance after chance to confess his love but alas things just don't go his way.,3757,557,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I''s pure is based on the extremely underated manga of the same name.,3758,558,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Another in the series of anime adapted marvel works. After Iron man Wolverine X-men and Blade now it is punisher and Black widow's turn. An unlikely team-up that starts with the vigilante Punisher who is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. and forced to work with Black Widow to stop the terrorist orginization Leviathan. What starts as an interesting story and a break from the generic team-up quickly becomes just another failed anime attempt. The characters who will be known to most or at least familiar are shallow copies and lack any real development. There is a bit of sexual tension between the spy and vigilante but it is all a mess. The only character that sheds some much needed light is a computer geek that is at least a little bit of fun. The rest is as dreary as can be without much more.,3759,559,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't help but give this a 10/10 all around. There are very few anime's that have made me cry as hard as this one did. It's just an amazing story all around. It made me really wish that I could see ghosts and fall in love with one as well.

Story: I love the script the principle of the ghost of the young girl in search of her past accompanied by a young man who is the only one to see it. However the end is pretty but too happy for such anime. Otherwise you have to admit it's an interesting mix of drama and humor that is fluid from beginning to end.,3793,579,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First off let me just say that I think that any great show should be able to truly immerse you into the universe that is being made and Tasogar Otome x Amnesia does this to a level I have rarely ever seen before.,3795,580,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Well the commercial was certainly very exciting but the movie was a little different.

I haven't watched a movie from Studio Ghibli in quite a while and I'm glad that I found this one. The animation had that touch of studio ghibli in it that it brought so many great memories from my childhood. Though the plot was pretty predictable thsi was one story I loved predicting. My emotions poured right out of me in the end. I love how she did a 360 on her perspective in life and how she was able to  see  first hand Marnie's life and incorperate it into her own.

In my personal opinion Yami Shibai is fantastic. It's simple and straight to the point; it's Japanese Ghost Stories. Being a fan of horror supernatural and generally most eerie things myself I was delighted with Yami Shibai. It's true that upon first glance at both the animation and the short episode length you wouldn't expect much from it.,3836,612,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Its very unique and interesting but it also has a downside. On the other hand this is the only anime that provides you a good information about Japan's Horror Stories. You can see that each episode will surprise you and sometimes even scare you. It was made for us horror fanatic and who mostly wants to broaden their knowledge with paranormal.,3837,613,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a very good anime. I like the story line of this anime for the sole episode. I just wish that there was more to this anime then one episode. The animation of the anime is very good. I love the details of the characters and the scenary. I love the songs that are in this anime. Espacially the opening song of it. I also like that the music dose not drown out the voices of the characters. Also I like most of the characters voicers because they are so cool. I love most of the characters in this anime because they are really awesome people. I also love the way the characters interact with the others in the anime. Overall this is a really good anime howerver I just wish that it had more episodes to it.,3849,625,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I have no idea what to say or feel about this... it's like... It really feels like this was supposed to be an anime version of a visual novel or otome game where the maker just took the bare bones plot points and their favorite jokes from it and threw it in there... So little is explained and so little yet so much happens I don't know how to feel. I guess there's enough to say  yeah that happened  but just barely and there's not enough in there to really know how or why or when or what's really going on. We don't even learn who these people really are either.,3853,626,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show was the fastest anime i have ever seen .. hahah this anime since it was only a 2 episode anime. Thats right only 2 episodes!! anime show was a very unique one i really cant tell you how good or bad it was only because its a 2 episode show so yea you can expect something like this.. This show started of Slow and ended Fast 2 Fast xD in my perspective so fast that i do not want to give to much detail because i feel like if i tell you what happen i will ruin The hole show since their aint much to talk about lol.. But yea it was interesting at the beginning so my recommendation to everyone reading this  is if you have time to spare and got nothing else to do you should watch this anime show since its only 2 episode long i mean it does not hurt? But like i said i would rather let you guys watch it and let you guys decide what you guys think i am really clue less as to what rate should this anime get since is a very very very short anime so not much should be expected of it so yea this is what i believe idk may be you may have a different opinion but will see......,3864,632,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I am pleased to present you with a review of a refreshingly unique romance anime when compared with the rest of the genre. While a lot of anime don't bother to get their characters very far in terms of developing relationships Lamune actually showcases the development of a relationship. Despite looking like it might turn into just another harem anime due to the fact that it's based off a dating sim and has an overabundance of female characters Lamune instead focuses on the romance between the main characters.,3881,645,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I watched this anime start to finish hoping it would get better. It did for the most part but the story really didn't make sense until the last few episodes. That being said it made no sense at all and felt really crudly put together. If they had written a better story I think more yuri lovers would give it a chance. ,3886,650,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Yurikuma is a surprisingly practical reflection of the real world. In contrast the story is told in an obscure way. Any reserved viewer is sure to utter  WTF?!  at least once. The whimsical images are purely symbolic and every piece of the story is made ready to be applicated to our own lives. At face level YKA is truly befitting the title Weird As Fuck. However that's not to say the show isn't a masterpiece. These dancing human-eating bears do not lie to us. Pain is neccessary in overcoming adversity and we see our heroines suffer thoroughly. We are rudely seperated with the most sympathetic characters over the course of the show. Yet as is true for the real world hope is not lost. Reality is never the same but we use the love we have left to forge on. There is no huge gratuitous backlash for the wrongs committed. The outcome is more realistic. The ending gives us a sincere interpretation of hope. Also I never thought I could be this emotionally attached to talking bears.    ,3887,651,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Yurikuma Arashi is an anime you really have to give a chance to envelop you give it the full chance to let yourself enjoy it. It starts off fairly strange characters you don't know a plot line you get dumped into very little explanation and harldy any answers. Before you know it the answers are slowly unfurling before your eyes and you're sucked into the story even if simply to find out what the heck is going on.,3888,652,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ginta is a lovable character and well every character has a lighter side to them...and those that don't well they pay for it. ill keep adding to this review as I watch more.

Where do I beging with this Anime.  First off I will say that it is so bad that the Manga version is the Canon part of the series.,3902,660,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As a stand alone series .Hack//DUSK may have been alright. However it isn't stand alone it bears the .Hack name and did a poor job of fitting in with the family so to speak. Based off of the Manga it should have done alright. It had a good story laid out for it to follow however not long after the frst couple of episodes it decided to stray from that path and follow a different direction which in my opinion was a horrible mistake.,3905,661,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Follows the .hack games franchise showing the unlocking of the two seal characters and the return of the cured word a very Chibi fun style anime but very entertaining think pokemon but for a more advanced audience. this will entertain you and you'll actually feel good after watching it,3906,662,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As a long-time fan of the .hack// franchise this is the only thing in the entire franchise I can't seem to bring myself to like (and this is including the confusing mess that was G.U. Trilogy) and it all boils down to one reason: the manga was better. The dub and the sub are relatively the same to me in this instance (aside from my pet peeve of the dub's insistance of prnouncing  Rena  as  Rayna ) so in this case the review is going to be more of a comparison between the manga and the anime.,3908,664,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Critic’s Log - September 30 2015. Review #99: The Tatami Galaxy,3921,677,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (or The Tatami Galaxy) is an anime about a university student stuck in a Groundhog Day-esque time loop. In the span of each episode our nameless main character (he is referred to as Watashi basically meaning  myself ) goes over the same two years of university unaware of the loop each time joining a different club in search of a  rose-coloured campus life .,3922,678,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I can't tell you what attracted me to this series apart from the name as I thought it was a person but I was completely off. Luckily I was persuaded to join up the FYAB group on this and it was well worth it. It's most certainly strange and oddball but it's quite fun.,3923,679,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,3927,680,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Lucky number seven. My lucky number isn't seven though but it might be for someone else around here. It was only poignant to make this anime short my seventh review as it is one of my favorite shorts and the fact that I've gotten particularly lazy lately but the show and reviews must go on. Anyway no spoilers or cursing as usual for my reviews. Comments and review the reviewer please! I appreciate it. Do not forget to check out my other reviews.

Although the title La Maison en Petits Cubes is fairly unusual for anime I wasn't expecting anything too unusual. So I was definitely suprised to find that it was much more like a western animated film. It reminded me of the beginning of Up (and i really liked the beginning of that film).,3937,687,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What a touching and poignant little vignette!  This short and moving little anime with its warm vibrant colors and evocatively affecting music spellbinds with its rich simple story of an old man remembering his past.,3939,688,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,3940,689,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This short masterpiece La maison en petits cubes is so wonderfully breathtakingly beautiful I almost cried. No wonder it won an academy award. For a short with no dialogue it spoke so much in twelve minutes. ,3941,690,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the first time I've given somethig all tens. This is a short animated film about an old man and his memoreis it will really pull your heart strings its been a long time since i cried for anything i watched but this deserves every tear I recomend this to anyone. ,3942,691,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,3944,692,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was so much better than it was given credit for.  Hopefully I can explain why to you in this review.  ,3945,693,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So the second season to the first Asura Cryin'.  Now I know what your thinking the first season wasn't even that good so why should I even bother to begin to watch this and I'll tell you why.  Its because the second season has everything that the first season was missing.  The action and emotions that while still being similar to that of the first season the second season does a much better job of drawing the viewer in and enabling them to connect with the charactes.  Which was something that the first season was sorely missing especially since it made some of the fights to be completely pointless and unnecessary.  The story for the second season runs the typical route the end of the world is approaching and such but what the second season imo does really well is creating this very sci-fi feel and in addition to the supernatural feel the show already has going for it creates a rather nice experience.  The animation is still about on the same level as the first season so it's still average though I will say that the battles may have looked a bit better or that could just be the positive influence of me enjoying the show.  The sound this time around was pretty similar to that of the first season though I will say that I did like the opening.  As for the characters will there was nothing really changed about them from the first episode I will say that I did find myself liking them a bit more.  So overall it makes a good series doing a lot of things right that the first season didn't do and if you watched the first season and haven't planned to watch the second then your missing out on something that wraps everything up rather nicely.,3947,695,2019-04-13 21:35:40
NOTE: This review is based on the first ep.,3948,696,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Relive your childhood. This is it. Years in the making. Rejoice and enjoy Dragon Ball at its finest. I reccomend watching this obviously silly 100 character minimum,3952,699,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Worst anime I ever saw. Toriyama should have retired after Cell Saga or Buu Saga. There is not a no single good thing in this series. From my favorite anime to worst crap ever.,3953,700,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,3954,701,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a very good sequel to a good movie and a great series. In my opinion I liked the sequel better than the other movie. The other movie was crap and boring and this and the series were good. I always thought this movie focused on the series more Sakura falls in love with yet another guy and tries to tell him that she loves him. It's very original.,3956,702,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,3958,703,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If I had to choose one thing about the CCS series that was good it would be this movie. Not just because it signifies the end of the series :P but it was a short wonderful story that actually wrapped everything up very well. Shoujo fluff at its best in this movie and that says a lot coming from me because i generally hate shoujo.,3960,704,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ruined everything. The plot sucked the voices changed (since I saw the dub) the character's personalities were completely trampled by the whole corny and cheesy theme.,3962,705,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,3963,706,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"If you look up  underappreciated anime  in the dictionary you'll find Moribito a gorgeous 26 episode series with a combination of a mature story brilliant acting beautiful visuals overall and not a single character that overstays its welcome. The relationship between each of the characters mainly Balsa and Chagum are part of the charm of the whole anime. Usually kids in anime get on my nerves but somehow even Chagum managed to become of many likeable characters in the story as he tries his best to fit within common society. Balsa is one of my favourite female protagonists with layers of depth to her character and great skill as a spear wielder she makes for both the most touching moments and jaw-dropping fightscenes in any anime I've ever seen let alone this one. If you're looking for a completely stylised anime thats strengths lay more on one aspect then you won't find it here. Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit is a well-rounded anime that when given the time of day will grow on you and soon you'll be popping in each DVD disc just waiting to see what happens next. Very underrated and highly recommended to anyone looking for a mature anime that doesn't rely heavily on sex violence or profanities but rather pure quality. Go buy it on DVD right now. You can get it for a very good price. ",3964,707,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The story is ok. The characters fit good within the story. It was easy to understand what was going on but not to the point that it was uninteresting. The part about this story that i didnt like was the idiot old timey politic authoritarian aspect. People obeying others just because thats the way it is. The only good part about that is that some of the characters like balsa and the old lady dont really pay heed to this and just blow off their authority customs if they dont feel like putting up with it.,3965,708,2019-04-13 21:35:40
My first time watching this anime years ago instantly solidified itself as one of my top 5 all time favorites and easily one of the best anime ever made from my point of view.

Yes I was stingy with the overall ranking. The story was wonderful the ending.. could have been better. I would have loved it if we had some closure for Tanda and Balsa. I would have also loved to see Chagum as the Emperor. Other than that this is a beautifully orchestrated masterpiece that needs to be as famous as say one of Miyazaki's films. I loved every second of it. Matter of fact I finished all 26 episodes in one day. Completely worth your time! If you're unsure just give the first 5 or so eps I shot and trust me you'll be hooked. 5 is an esaggeration I think after 2 eps one would be completely absorbed into the dynamics politics every-day ups and downs of New Yogo Empire! Enjoy! ,3974,714,2019-04-13 21:35:40

‘Seirei no Moribito’ (‘Moribito for short) is a very polarizing series. Many praise it for its stellar production values great atmosphere and layered believable characters. Others find the show relentlessly boring and slow-paced disparagingly referring to it as ‘Boribito’.,3980,718,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the anime that got me into Anime. I couldn't sleep one night and found this on netflix. Needless to say I did not sleep that night at all. ,3981,719,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I stumbled across Seirei no Moribito on Netflix while trying to find something to watch.  Yes that means I gave in and watched it dubbed even though I prefer subs. My reasoning was that watching it via Netflix actually supports the anime industry unlike fansubs (plus I can watch it on my iPhone =P) so every now and again I break down and watch the dubs.  I found Moribito to be a stunning example of animation with good storytelling and memorable characters.,3982,720,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For any fans of Tales from the Crypt this is most definitely the anime for you. Each episode follows a different character who has visited the pet shop. This 4 episode OVA is filled with creepy and spooky tales and at the end of the episode you may just learn a lesson or moral from each story.,4003,730,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is probably one of my most favorite anime's of all time. The characters are just amazing and really well developed. Theres some serious subtext between Detective Orcot and Count D so if your a shonen-ai fan you might like it. (Also since Count D dresses/looks like a girl. All of the pets have such interesting stories and I was never bored on an episode! A definite must watch!,4004,731,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Pet Shop of Horrors is one of those anime that sounds like it would be worth watching.  Honestly I wasn't too impressed.  I do plan on reading the manga at some point because I do like the character Count D but the anime is far from appealing.,4011,734,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I don't think any anime has made be cry so suddenly and without warning... Literally 3 minutes before I'm completely normal and 3 mintures later I'm sobbing. This animation is only 3 minutes long yet it manages to tell a story better than most anime or movies. Its really it's hard to explain in words the effects of this anime its only 3 minutes so just watch it and see for yourself. ,4012,735,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is personally my favorite i love Rumiko's work and all the others like inuyasha and ranma but this is really good... if you have ever seen any of her other works you can tell that Lum one of the main chaarcters incorporates a little bit of everything all her other female main charcters has which makes lum the best. i love the love story and thats pretty much it..... its really good trust me :D,4014,737,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Intro- Moroboshi Ataru is the world's unluckiest boy. He's also the world's biggest prevert and can't seem to get a single girlfriend. 1 day aliens come down to take over the Earth but they give the helpless Earthlings a chance to save themselves by randomly picking a hero to play a game of tag against their chosen player(Lum the princess of the aliens). Unfortunately for Earth their hero is Ataru. While everyone prepares for the world to end Ataru does his best to capture the princess but unfortunately for him she can fly and send electric shocks. As a result Ataru's love Shinobu makes a deal with him that if he can win the game of tag she will marry him. That encourges our hero Ataru and allows him to win the match in the final minutes and upon winning yells out for everyone to hear “Now I can marry her!” Unfortunately Ataru doesn't specifically which “her” … thus Lum and the race of invading aliens accept his proposal for marriage.,4015,738,2019-04-13 21:35:40

the idea behind the show is interesting people having a special power and there being a large list of possibilities. the possible growth of how powerful somone can become. the levels of ecchi and yuri content is rediculus and probably the main reason i dropped this show. secondly the topics of the movie are rather stupid big deals made over  criminals  commiting crimes similar to young girls slumber party pranks.,4031,747,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Line drawings of clouds.  Maybe that sounds like your idea of entertainment but you'll probably find it as dry as it sounds.  There's no plot no events just clouds.  This seemed like a rough animation school project.  Maybe the experimentation provided some valuable insight to the creator but this is one of the most boring things I've ever watched.,4034,749,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I plan on writing a review for this anime in detail when I have some time. For now I am being merciful by telling you not to touch this with a 10 foot pole. Seriously don't even think about it. I like zoids as much as the next mecha lover but this is just utter crap. Theres a reason why it was dropped in the U.S..I'm giving it a .5 just because I liked the other Zoid animes and don't want a 0 to tarnish their reputation.,4037,750,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Mirasato Keiichi is the unluckiest person alive. Although he is genuinely a nice guy bad things always seem to happen to him. Constantly turned down by girls and mistreated by the guys in his university dorm Keiichi shoulders his burdens quietly. One night while trying to make a phone call Keiichi inadvertently dials the Goddess Assistance Hotline. It would seem that Heaven has not been blind to his misfortunes and has sent the goddess Belldandy to grant him one wish. Belldandy is so beautiful and so kind to him that he spontaneously wishes that she can stay with him. Forever. In what can only be described as His unending sense of humor God allows the wish to be granted and Belldandy is Keiichi’s forever with all the benefits and problems that come with her.

Storyline is good but not great it misses some suspension elements and overall it's a good anime to watch if you like a serie which isnt going in a distincitve way but is very relaxing to watch because the plot is simple and the characters are funny,4052,758,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was a great anime I loved Belldandy Urd Skuld Keiichi and everyone else it got weird at times but that just made it interesting. Everytime Belldandy and Keiichi were almost there I was at the edge of my seat until Skuld or someone else came in and messed it up and all my emotion blew up without anywhere to go. I was extremely happy when the second season came out and watched every single episode immediately on youtube (I've watched it about 3 times now) This anime will definite remain as one of my favorites for a long time if not forever.,4053,759,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is a great story.. I was kinda worried at first because it sounds to be a girly type story but after watching a couple episodes I fell in love with it.  There really isn't much to complain about this anime to be honest. I highly recomend watching this when you get a chance.,4056,761,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Overall I really liked this series. There were plot holes (like how Keiichi made enough to feed not ony one but three goddesses) but we can assume it's all taken care of by Belldandy's contract.,4057,762,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"Let me see... What can I say about this anime? I'll say this first. I like dopey and sentimental. To me it's a refreshing change of pace from what we see everyday.

I'd have to say I'm a sucker for these kind of romances. I was rooting for the little brother all along but I guess you could say I'm kind of a weirdo. The anime had the kind of feel that was shown in  The Perfect Girl Evolution  and  B Gata H Kei  (which happen to be to of my favorite animes).,4062,767,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Given my lukewarm response to Ghost in the Shell: Arise I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this capstone film. This is the conclusion of the Firestarter arc that began in the first Arise OVA and has divided fans since episode one. From the Lain-like animation style to the visual representations of Ghosts and hacking fans of Stand Alone Complex haven't been too reecptive to this series.

This will not be my usual style of review because this show exhausted me. after what i have seen of this mess i dont want to think about it anymore so this will be very short. This anime is the immature version of sailor moon there is no real detective work to speak of so dont expect mystery. the characters seemed interesting enough but whoever voiced them obviously did not enjoy the job.the animation went through a drastic change in quality from really bad to acceptable.The only characters i enjoyed were the president of the evil organization and his assistant. I dont recomend this to anyone older than 10 there is no blood sexualtyetc.so it is safe for kids to watch.  A family friendly tag should be added to this show. Thats all now i never have to think about this show again.  ,4074,776,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This OVA is a crossover of 3 music bands ( CaS   d2b  and  DEARDROPS ) from different visual novels related to each others the content of the OVA itself is only a concert (no story) where some of the best songs are performed by each band.,4085,784,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Air Master is the perfect combination of Ecchi Lesbianism and Battle anime that I have ever seen. As far as a story goes we never really get in to why the Air Master fights.  I mean we get bits and pieces but no here is why and this is the point to all of this. I am not a big battle anime watcher. I get tired of the two fighters coming out with a massive move and just when you think they are down Whammo the person send a bigger attack to his opponent... Well any way the story was strong enough to keep me interested and I saw this on crunchyroll and it did seem to have a little age behind it but still a good watch if you can handle the repetitive-esqe type battles.,4086,785,2019-04-13 21:35:40

when i first saw this anime i  immediate fell in love with it.The action isvery cool and smooth i suggest you go and experience the anime for yourself.,4091,788,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Before I start reviewing this let me just say... Girl power is AWESOME! I'm pretty weak myself but this was so cool to me. This anime is about a girl who is nicknamed  Air Master  because of her awesome street fighting skills! She looks scary at first but when you meet her you discover she's actually pretty clumsy and a liiiiittle dumb. She makes friends with 4 girls and lemme warn ya' there is a little bit of obvious hinting that one of her friends (the one with the huge boobs) is in love with the MC. But anyway along the way she meets lots of enemies who of course she defeats. While getting a stalker who is SOOO hilarious you will just see him thinking about her and getting all pervy with it and she some 20mi or something away getting chills xD back to the subject this anime is super awesome and I reccomend it to those who like that kind of thing of girls being stronger than guys... Wait what girl doesn't like that?,4094,789,2019-04-13 21:35:40
    Air Master is a fighting/Martial Arts Adaptation of the  manga that was serialized in the Hakusens  Young Animal. It was licensed by Geneon for release in the states but unfortunately only four discs have been released thus far and there are no plans for any more to be released.,4095,790,2019-04-13 21:35:40
this anime was amazing in all of the various usual ways the animation and the story are both great and the characters are above and beyond just about any i have seen. what makes me a diehard fan of this anime though is the dark side it has to it i still haven't found a single anime with a character like maki. I can't really describe what it exactly but there is something incredible about her that nothing else has ever come close to i have watched a lot of combat anime but this isn't even comparable to the genre if i could i would make up a new genre but then this would be the only anime in it.,4096,791,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,4097,792,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Honestly the score is just a guard/. This series was pretty good. Now I could go into story depths and the complexity characters and interwoven stories. But sadly that would make me a liar. Most of the characters are 'one note' even Maki herself.  The story is fairly cliched and the progression is somewhat predictable.,4098,793,2019-04-13 21:35:40

From the description of Magikano's story and the various images you can find of the characters you would never guess just how aggressive and violent the girls can be. If  Slapstick  and  Jealousy  had a baby together you'd get Magikano. I got this series completely on a whim and I couldn't be happier with my aquisition of such a hilarious series. Sadly it's a short series but then the short series usually are very good. It is so much fun to watch and involves an array of events as normal as a trip to the pool to things as strange as talking cat panties (didn't see that one coming).,4107,799,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime was a very funny one. It was truly a good harem anime yet it was unfit for the favorites bin. The story animation and characters were not well thought out and yet they were interesting in their own way. The the ending of the show left more to be desired and felt like the were trying to force a second season out of it.,4112,800,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show has some cute character design and dancing chibis in the ending credits. That is ALL that can be said in favor of this show. Some of the gags are funny the first few times they get used but they beat every joke to death and beyond. The ecchi sprikled throughout the show doesn't make up the idiot premise and dire lack of plot. Worst of all though is the ending that will actually make you curse aloud and tempt you to throw something hard and heavy at the screen. Be warned: suckage dwells here.,4113,801,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Out of all of the Pokemon movies out there this is my absolute least favorite right next to the Temple of the Sea one. I honestly can't even tell you what happened I was bored out of my mind the whole movie and therefore could not pay attention to what was going on. I don't know where this falls with the rest of the movies using the Hoenn characters but to me it felt as though they were just trying to stretch Max and May until the fanbase got bored with them which isn't really isn't saying much because I hated Max since the first episode he appeared in. And Lucario himself is the most annoying character in this whole movie and whatever relationship he had with his owner creeped me out. Lucario was way too obsessed with him. I don't even know what to say anymore this movie sucked so bad I wouldn't recommend it to a hardcore Pokemon fan.,4134,812,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have only seen 1 episode 25 and I haven't seen a 2nd special for this show. The first special is not really a continuation of the story/plot and does not fill any gaps left after the finale. Instead it mainly focuses on Shizuo and Izaya with a cameo by their siblings including both of Izaya's twin sisters. I honestly liked the episode but I hope there will still be a season 2. Hope this helps for anyone looking at this. Episode 25 is streaming on animefreak.tv,4154,819,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I seen both specials and needless to say there isn’t anything spectacular about these episodes. They're more like fillers if that makes sense. It doesn’t really contribute much to the original storyline of the series. Despite that it was okay to watch and would recommend it if you need your daily dose of your favorite characters.,4155,820,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Nothing special. Some short clips within a clip that are somewhat funny or do a comedy type description of some terms from the anime. Usually these involve a chibi character on someones head.,4161,824,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Shana season 2 specials (3 episodes) AKA Shana-tan season 2. I never watched the original Shana-tan. Animation and sound are on par with the normal series except there’s tiny ‘chibi’ versions of certain characters like Shana and it seemed at times like the pervy ecchiness level was raised a tad. Oh and it’s only available in Japanese. This is supposed to be some comedy so let’s see if Rie Kugimiya’s voice ruins my fun here. I just watched the main anime (season 2) so I’m in a slightly positive mood. Being a special of an anime I’ve already reviewed I’ll leave out the animation sound and character sections that I usually have in my reviews.,4162,825,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Typically I review things on Amazon and my blog but I had to get this out here since CrunchyRoll and Media Blasters have been doing a bit of a promotional blitz to promote this insipid wretched garbage heap of a show so you might be suckered into watching it. Please for the love of all that is good and  Holy  (I know I'm a comedy genius) don't. Just don't. I've been watching anime for well over a decade and I can firmly say that  Holy Knight  is at the very very bottom of the barrel of the wide gamut of stuff I've seen. Oh yeah. It's that bad.,4189,839,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There are a few bad/average reviews here so i thought i will give this one my opinion.,4191,841,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Okay so there are only two episodes in this anime so far which really isn't a substantial amount to write an accurate review. I have noticed that most of the reviews paint this anime in a negative light and after reading them I wasn't really sure on whether I'd actually enjoy this anime but I'm one of those people who like to formulate their own opinions rather than simply sticking with what other people think. So I thought I'd write this based on what I thought of the anime. I will warn you the ratings I've given are misleading in the way that I wrote them based on what the anime was aiming for rather than the result. So here goes.,4192,842,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Mushibugyou follows a young samurai named Jinbei Tsukishima in Edo hoping to be a member of the Insect Magistrate's office in the place of his father. In the Insect Magistrate's office their only duty is to protect the peace in Edo from the monstrous insects. When Jinbei got to be one of the members of the office he met his new teammates namely Mugai Hibachi Tenma Ichinotani and Shungiku Koikawa. But the problem is that all of his teammates believed that he will quit in less than 3 days and he was too weak to fight the insects. ,4197,845,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story:(6/10) Hellsing organization tries to keep it a secret that vampires exist. Their main guy is a vampire himself named Alucard. Alucard turns a police girl into a vampire to save her. And they do some missions solo and together. Thats the whole story. Not too deep and not a very impressive story but its solid and effective enough for a short 13 episode anime.,4198,846,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Loved it loved it loved it! The story is easy to understand and follow and you fall in love with the characters easily making them easier to relate too. This anime has alot of action in it but balances it out with some dark comedy making it blend nicely. I wouldn't say this anime is for everyone as there is a bit of violence in it and blood...lots and lots of blood. But what would you expect from an anime that has a vampire as its main character! Alucard is an amazing character and I love his background story. I couldn't get enough of the Hellsing organization and all of its characters even the minor characters make the story that much better where as with most anime's the minor characters are easily forgotten as most tend to focus on the main character(s) of the story. That is not the case with this series as even the smallest characters make a stand for themselves which was a nice refresher. All in all this series has everything that I love in it strong characters a strong male lead plenty of action to go around comedy though its slightly darker and not as cheery but with this series I prefered it that way and even some added  bad guys  that you actually rooted for. It was a perfect mix of all that and more jam packed in just 12 episodes!!! It didn't feel rushed at all to me and the story was played out smoothly and effeciently. All in all great anime! Besides action mixed with dark comedy and well played characters what's not to love?,4200,848,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think that this is a fairly good anime. It has a fairly good story line to it. Sometimes I wish that they would go into a little more detail with the story line but it is still fairly good as it is. The animation in this anime I think needs some work in some areas like with some of the character details needs some more details to them. The scenary details are good in some areas but other areas I think need a few more details added to it but it still has some good animation with some of the characters. I like some of the music that plays through out the anime espically diring the fighting scences. I like most of the voices for the characters. I also think that this anime has some pretty awesome characters to it and also some not so awesome characters. Over all I think that this is a pretty good anime to watch if you like vapire animes.,4205,851,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was pretty disappointed after watching Hellsing probably because of all the praise I hear for this series. Don't get me wrong I thoroughly enjoyed the animation the characters and the music but the story left much to be desired. At the end I was left guessing and there were way too many important pieces missing. All of these unanswered questions made me want to flip tables in frustration. ,4208,852,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Alright before someone yells at me I have to say that at the time that I am doing this review I have not seen Hellsing Ultimate. Well I have seen only part of Hellsing Ultimate anyway. I have not finished that series off but in my belief up to now I actually think this one is better in some ways then the little bit I have seen of the OVA. Put your pitchforks down please let me at least have a chance to explain myself.,4211,855,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This surprisingly isn’t as bad as most shows based on games are. Normally they base it on people who have actually seen the game and not on new people just coming in. I have never really played the game but I have watched play throughs and know a basic about the story of the game. This movie explains a bit more about the storyline and seems to pick up after the game or at least some years after. Sadly most of it is very cryptic and through the eyes of a child rather then an adult who might have actually understood what was going on during that time. With my basic knowledge it was a bit hard to understand. It jumps from the past to the present in a very large leap that I guess was trying to give you information but it was much more confusing then it should be. That and the forced romance between Cloud and Tifa seemed to throw me off. It felt really disjointed the way that they brought it about. I can understand the cuteness of Cloud but the way Tifa acts to it it feels as though they had some sort of romance of the sexual kind and are now just having awkward conversations after. It was like that through the movie whenever they did meet.,4266,871,2019-04-13 21:35:40

With a name like Bastard!! you know it's at least looking into right? I mean come on you can't tell me you're not a little bit curious; or else why would you be reading this review? Well Tea's here to give you the skinny on this 6 episode muscle-fest. If you like a lot of action-packed muscle magic fights comedy and don't mind some boob-ige popping up from time to time(get it?  Popping up  boobs? *cough* anyway...) Bastard!! is a good show for you. With only six episodes it's worth looking into right? ~Tea,4332,886,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think it has a great story line and characters. I was really surprised with some parts. I really liked the three main characters. They were different. It's a great anime probably not for everyone.

Every now and then I sit at my desk and breathe a long sigh and face-plant my head on the keyboard solely of out of boredom. Why? I'm simply stuck without a series to keep me entertained until another episode of this season's fantastic lineup becomes available.

This OVA completely destroyed the series. While the ending of the TV series was hard to deal with and was really sad this ending was way too happy. I think that the whole anime was really dark and the ending should be dark too.  Bad  end was the only option for such anime. I feel like the OVA was only intented to satisfy fans - and I totally think that creator of the scenario should NOT do such things.,4362,899,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is quite an old and odd collection of short films based on the manga Violence Jack. All 3 parts found on one disc in the official Manga video collection Violence Jack is set in a dark time of global collapse as a giant earthquake destroys mankind's home and causes everyone to scrounge for life under city ruins desperately hunting down food and entertainment splitting off into different factions due to different mindsets lust and general insanity. Released in the late 80's this anime was certainly pushing the boundaries of censorship as it was largely banned and heavily edited in many countries outside Japan. The reasoning would go down to all kinds of perversions not considered suitable for viewing let alone involved in a series such as its high sexual and violent content and taboo subjects like cannibalism rape and bondage. I would advise you to check with the product info to find out whether or not it is cut because if you are seriously considering buying this then you probably don't want 15 minutes of controversy vanishing.,4365,902,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai review Part 4,4385,910,2019-04-13 21:35:40
As a movie Kara no Kyoukai Movie 4: Garan no Dou fails. Of course it is part of a series just the  Movie  in the name is out there to trip you up. It is in essence an origin story a sequel to the second installation and a prequel to the third (which is a prequel to the first). The lack of order is something that can either be a strength or a weakness but in this case it is a weakness.,4386,911,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai – Garan no Dou (AKA Hollow Shrine) is the 4th movie in this seinen supernatural mystery series based on the Type-Moon universe light novels written by Kinoko Nasu. After the intense action of the first 3 movies this one takes a slight break and focuses on the characters particularly Shiki and her coma which has barely been mentioned in the movies thus far (but has in the books at this point). I’m not sure what the point of this review is since viewers will know if they want to watch the Kara no Kyoukai series or not from the first few movies. Nevertheless I soldier on in case anyone wants a review of the 4th movie.,4388,913,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For an anime based on a really good manga they did a horrible job.  Even if it were not based on a manga and I judged it without that foundation it is barely subpar because of how badly the story gets sucked into a mundane boring rinse and repeat routine.  She is the wolverine of the X-men movies.  Ya know a story with an ensemble type of cast of characters but irresponsibly it focuses too much on one character.  The mistake with X-men is it is supposed to be a team not a one man show.  In Rosario's case though the rest of the cast may not have the same power or level of power they have different skills and specialties that in the manga you get to see them use alot more.  It is seen some in the manga but not as much and in the end everyone still depends way too heavily on Rosario herself.  She always needs Tskune to remove her rosary but that isn't the way things always worked in the manga which makes for an incredibly worlds better story.  Also in the anime the characters do not seem to progress or change much or at least no where near like they do once again in the manga.  ,4411,927,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The plot is just interesting enough to keep you watching the next episode. I watched the first season with interest and tried to keep an open-mind. What ruined the show is the overwhelming amount of sexual tinged scenes. Seriously the number of panty shots per episode is ridiculous. This is excluding the fact that some of the girls look like they are in elementary school and that mostly all the characters are underage. I can deal with one or two panty shots every couple of episodes. When it occurs in every episode numerous times it becomes stale really quick. Couple that with the boob rubbing and it makes the series barely watchable. The plot is what held me on through the first season. After the first season I was done. ,4420,933,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Ah this was my getway anime into the more obscure and less widely known anime. Ah well it  was fine not the best but it wasn't that good either. I mean there's really no general story or its too vague they should have followed the manga was closely. If you even liked the anime  you will LOVE the manga. I thought the anime was pretty good until I read the manga. The only thing that the manga and anime have in common are most characters but even the anime deviates from the manga way too much.....It's really bad...I think Rosario+Vampire could fare a lot better. Season 2 or Capu2 is just another joke.,4421,934,2019-04-13 21:35:40

this was a great anime. i loved it. i really enjiy the idea of vamoires and werewolves and other creatures and what made it more interesting is thast they made look SEXY! even though there really was no story and its just tsukune (whos human) going to a monster skool and the whole anime is just telling his life story im sure any guy would want to have his life because he has 5 girls fighting over him. yea thats right 5! during the course of the show more and more come. of course he stars with one but as time passes he meets more and more they fall for him and the trick is only these girls kno that he is human. if the rest of the skool found out he was human he would be killed on the spot. i recomend watching it jus for laughs cuz it is hilarious it has great animation. hope you enjoy!,4437,936,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Light and upbeat anime series. While the plot is simple the different characters introduced far apart keep the story fresh. It is a typical harem series and uses a lot of ecchi.

At first there doesn't seem  to be much of a story. There is a introduction of new characters and the lances and knight  universe'  are explained.: There are only few Knights left in the world the knights have a job to serve and project the people. Yotaro is a knight that happens to save a little girl whose dad is always away from home. By saving people from their perils the group grows almost like a typical harem amine series. Its not a bad thing per se  but it lacks originality.,4462,950,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm at the 2nd episode so maybe I'm judging too early but this anime is complete horse dung.   The story has gaping holes in it and the characters are all thrown at us with no development whatsoever.  There is no  plot  and it's not like it's a comedy anime (with no plot) because there's no humor. The sound is relatively boring but the animation is okay.  I've definitely seen better animation though.  As of episode two - don't bother watching this anime. ,4463,951,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Perfect Blue was the first work of now-deceased anime director Satoshi Kon and was based on the novel of the same name by Yoshikazu Takeuchi. It would be the mark that would pave the way for Satoshi Kon’s career as a director and showcased the themes he would consistently cover later in his other works. It follows Mima a popular idol who decides to leave behind her cutesy girl-band image and pursue a career as an actress. This leads to blurred reality and fiction as murders are committed and Mima is confronted by crazed stalkers an unpleasable public and her own crumbling psyche.,4471,956,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The theme of identity is probably the most universal in storytelling. How many of us have attempted to change who we were tried to rise above the faults that we precieve about ourselves?

Wow! I was really surprised by this show. I thought it was going to be just another action show. I was surprised to find out that I was wrong. What was really great about the show were the characters. There were a lot of of depth to them. In just a short amount of time (it's only 12 episodes) it felt like I really got know the characters and I felt for the characters when they were struggling. I kind of had an idea in my mind that short action series couldn't be good because they would just rush through everything.

This is much better than the original Fate/ Stay Night by a ton xD. The biggest changes I've seen from this transition is that Saber fights more because Shirou actually allows her to fight and on that note the same goes for Archer. Archer in the original only fought about one(really epic) battle but in this he is there most of time with Saber....if not showing up late a few times. Another huge difference is that (SPOILER WARNING for anyone who hasn't watched the original Fate/ Stay Night) Shirou doesn't have romantic feelings for Saber. Thank You! Is that just me or does anyone else find it weird that Shriou liked his servent? I didn't I always thought it should be Rin and behold it was xD(Another Spoiler xD). The rest is cleaned up very nicely. Characters have more devlopment than in the original the music is as great as ever in every Fate anime and the animation looks like or in my opinion better than Fate/ Zero's. I give this anime a 9.2/10 as it so rightfully deserves :D. Can't wait until they finish it next year(In April -___-).,4495,977,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I try so hard to like this but I literally cringe every time I watch an episode. It's like I'm sitting around hoping for the story to develop but it's a bunch of nonsense and irrelevant flash backs. There is so much to work with but nothing ever happens.

I have to admit whoever writes the story for the series is really smart. The original was not bad the ending was weak and the movie somewhat atoned for the mistake but they felt that it could be way better. Along cam Fate/Zero. They hit the nail head-on and made one of the best series in the past few year. So if at first you succeed do the same again. And they did. They threw away the comedic/stupid-ish style of the original and made something that is a rightful heir to Fate/Zero. Im not concerned about the upcoming episodes it was pretty obvious that they are on th right track and dont intend to leave it. ,4511,986,2019-04-13 21:35:40
We'll start from the end: do you like fighting? If so then this is definitely worth a watch. It is good enough on all levels (and even great on some) to make anyone who likes superpowered combat get some kicks out of it. Even though this is essentially half a series it is already on the right track to be a classic for people who like a battle of good vs. evil expressed through superpowers and treachery.,4513,987,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Baby Steps puts a spin on the usualy sports anime. Eiichiro Maruo starts off knowing next to nothing about tennis allowing the audience to learn along with him. Baby Steps offers some level of intensity that sports series are known for while also keeping a lighthearted mood throughout the show. It also has the most canon romance I've ever seen in any sports show.,4537,999,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I loved this manga so much which is why I was so excited about an anime version of it.  I cannot even express how disappointing this was.  It's all titilation without any of the humanity or character depth that makes Nozoki Ana such a great read.  They played cheap porn music throughout the poorly drawn poorly constructed animation emphasizing how little they cared about the story here when they could show naked girls instead.  Such a waste; such a disappointment.,4574,21,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had my worrying thoughts as soon as I saw the studio taking on this show. SHAFT. As much as I like Shaft's work in terms of art and the comedies they produce they should not be allowed to touch an existing series at all and should be left for them to do what they do best and particularly ruin shows with their way of animating. ,4615,41,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Miu Nomura a middle school teenager who when she was younger loved to play the piano and it brought a lot of joy to her life.  However she became too shy to express her feelings and as a result her piano playing has suffered greatly as she cannot express her feelings while playing the piano.  She has to learn how to deal with her crush on an upperclassman which may help her find the joy in playing music again.,4617,43,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is by far the best anime I have even watched in terms of comedy. I laughed at every episode because of the random but well thought out story line. I also like the way they add a sexual element without relying on it and the games are funny twists on real ones (Like musucal chairs where they ignore the chair and fight instead). The best part is the characters are deep and amazing but at the same time changeable and hilarious. It's a must watch series and needs a second season,4618,44,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime really suprised me. At first I didn't know what to expect. Though after watching the first episode I was hooked! It kept me laughing every episode and overall it was one of my favorites this season.,4621,45,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I think Night Raid is a great show for people who liked Cowboy bebop. The story of night raid is pre world war 2 and has many character side storied which follow the main story the character can span 1-3 epsodes which allows the viewer to understand character better. Although the main sow is small in has many specials which allow the viwer to under the story and plot better. I personaly think the show is underrated compared to many other shows of the same genre.,4654,55,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Normally I try to give a show three or four episodes before I give up on it but I dropped this after the first episode. The premise is kinda interesting and the art and animation isn't bad but the fanservice is so excessive that it ruins the show. It was around the point that a demon tiger's lightning attack was fondling the main girl's boobs and rubbing her crotch that I realised the show wasn't worth it.,4660,57,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I had already seen the series and didn't really understand the point of the films it barley shows any more then the series is slightly more graphic and just seems pointless to me.

Berserk Golden Age III: Descent: Tercera película que le da el cierre al Golden Arc. Abarca el retorno de Guts la tortura de Griffith y las consecuencias del Eclipse. Estas es una de las películas que más diferencias presenta con lo visto en el anime y lo leído. Lo cual no quiere decir que está mal es más puedo agregar que lo que han incluido lo han hecho de muy buena forma haciendo más interesante la trama en esta película así como dar algo fresco a los que ya hemos visto este arco varias veces (Manga/Anime). No obstante no todo es bueno creo que esta vez llevan un ritmo muy acelerado en la trama y se enfocan en muchas cosas que no son de mucha relevancia .Sacrificando así valiosas escenas que pudieron haber sido incluidas. Como por ejemplo el retorno de Guts a la banda de los halcones pasa de una manera muy acelerada quitando así por completo el factor nostalgia y esperanza que da cuando este por fin vuelve a la banda tras escuchar que están ofreciendo mucho dinero por la cabeza de estos. Lo extraño es que teniendo el doble de minutos que sus anteriores entregas decidan en este film apresurar tanto las cosas a mi parecer algo que lo único que consiguen es disminuir la calidad de la obra y decepcionar fans.,4689,70,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This show was so boring... I mean i knew what i was getting into with it as it's a Shoujo-ai anime at an all girls school. So i was expecting Maria sama with different characters. I can't believe this show actually made Maria sama look good... Yes while both had whiny bitchy characters. Aoi Hana turned up the drama and waterworks past the dial limit. It was very annoying to watch a girl crying every episode about whatever crisis was occuring at that very moment. It was very easy not to pay attention for 10 mins and still figure out what was going on.. even if nothing really happened for the majority of the time. for an anime so short it seemed like each episode was over an hour long. wishing for the anime to end while you are on ep 2 is never a good sign.

There is not much of a story. The sound is okay but the highlight is when hallelujah. I hope that this anime was meant to be stupid and comical or else it is majorly sad.

The characters are well drawn and also have great personalities for each and every character. Everything about it is uniqe and different from most other animes which really makes this anime great. It is another anime that I would have to redcommened this along with other anime and manga. The only down side is that the ending was despresing because of the fact that He ends up in another world needing to restart from fresh. It would really be cool if they continued the anime just to see weather or not Zed gets to see his friends ever again. Above it all it was astonising and loved it from start to finish.

Well after finally watching this I see why people like it. It has a rather colorful tone without getting too cliche and cheery and it's lead Spike Spiegel is rather charismatic and likable. That being said the series still has some flaws. Let's start with the other characters. Most of them aren't really that interesting and sometimes seem to hinder the show's progress. Some episodes are rather sketchy (episodes 10 and 18 for example) and seem to bind the plot down with unresolved past problems and mawkish sentimentality. And there are a few instances where Spike holds his breath in space (not possible). So it's not the perfect anime many make it out to be but it is still enjoyable if you want a nice relaxed anime where everything feels so calm and colorful.,4782,112,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Cowboy Bebop is truly a revolutionary Anime as well as one of my favorites which is something really special considering I feel that way even 15 years after its debut in 1998! Everything from its story to its animation to its sound to its characters is way above its time making it an instant universal classic. I'll start with the story which some had a few complaints about including the fact that it doesn't follow the main story line for around 75% of the anime but rather showed the adventures of Spike Ed Jet and Faye encountered in their sci-fi universe (a lot of which included background story lines for many of the characters) however not only feel that it was better but i also felt that it was helpful for it really emphasized those episodes which did cover the exciting story of Spike's past. Speaking of which the main story line is sure to stir emotions in many with it being full of everything thats wanted including action romance emotions and not to mention the twist ( I forgot to mention it is HALARIOUS at times to). The last few episodes are sure to leave a mark on it's viewers. Overall i gave it a 9.5 out of 10. Next i'll go on to the animation which i admit suprised me...in a good way. When was first thinking of watching this show i was reluctant for i wasn't sure if the animation would be good due to the date in which it was aired yet i was shocked to see how surprisingly good it was! Trust me when i say not a detail is missed through the fast paced action scenes to the heart warming romantic scenes. So overall its very very good and i'm not sure if it was the surprise factor but i give it a 10 out of 10! Next i'll go on to the sound which like the animation surprised me. Both the opening and ending theme songs were amazing and really suited the style of the anime. To add to that the songs played through the anime were also astounding and unlike other anime i watch where I just forget about the songs overtime these ones really stick to you for they bring out so much more in the anime. The sound in general is also very very good in the anime and you can see how the creators made sure no detail was left out. Overall I gave the sound a 10 out of 10. Lastly I come to the characters. To be honest I loved Spike from the start for he is cool and easy going yet he fight like a monster which is shown in the early stages of the anime. The other three Faye Jet and Ed took me some time to like yet after getting used to them as well as learning their back stories not only have i come to like them but i have come to love them! The villian a man name Vicious is also amazing for being exactly what he is supposed to be... a cold-hearted person who is evil throughout the anime. But that is exactly what made me love him! The creators do well to make almost every charcter relay a certain emotion to the audience whether it be hate respect or utter bewilderness (I'm talking about Mad Pierrot who is one heck of a unique character :P). Without giving any spoilers or using bad language just know that there are many surprises in terms of characters awaiting you in this show. Overall i gave the characters a 10 out of 10. So there you have it basically i think this is an AWESOME one of a kind anime that is a must see for every anime as well as sci-fi lover. In fact i'm pretty sure anyone would fall in love with the show when they watched it for it has the perfect balance of all the right things needed to create an instant classic. I loveeeeddd this anime and I'm sure you will to. Overall I gave Cowboy Bebop 9.8 out of 10,4792,116,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,4793,117,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,4794,118,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Lets see I first stumbled across Cowboy Bebop sometime in early 2004.  Which quite coincidencely is right around the same time that I had been getting into the rather old western movies though I was only beginning to develope a taste for jazz.  Of course during that same time I was a huge fan of anime and so when I heard the name Cowboy Bebop I must admit that it got me rather curious.  About just what this anime could be about and so it was with that curiosity that I started to watch Cowboy Bebop.,4795,119,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Cowboy Bebop is yet another Lupin III show. But this time it features a group of poor bounty hunters who must fight bad guys hunt down bounty heads and cheat on things (which is Spike's abilitiy) to earn money.,4798,120,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you like shows that blend all kinds of genres almost seamlessly you will love Cowboy Bebop. It blends almost every genre you could think of into its story. I wouldn't have been surprised if there was a musical episode somewhere along the way (unfortunately there wasn't :P),4808,128,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of the best animes out there . A bit on the short side but it complements with amazing animation  great story  unforgettable characters  funny and sad moments all tied up to create one of the most amazing Sci-fi / western anime there is . You will remember this one years after you watched it and still want to go back because  although it's been 17 years since it's release  it doesn't fail to deliver . This takes nr 5 on my top animes that I've watched .,4810,129,2019-04-13 21:35:40
In my opinion Cowboy Bebop was stupid. The ending was stupid. I thought it was stupid because it ended without telling what happened to Edward or what happened to Jet or Fay. The only person who had a conclusion was Spike. And. Oops ((SPOILER ALERT)) He dies. So it makes no sense about how he died and how the whole series ended. it could of finished in a diffrent way But NOOOO. It had to end that way.,4811,130,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Much more than just an anime show.Great music. It passes many messages about life. It combines western with space and 60's in a awsome way.Characters are greateveryone with it's diferent past as is the story.It really leaves that mystery blues/jazz feeling.I highly recomend it to anyone especially those that like jazz and or blues.,4813,131,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Bebop is a good anime next to anime like death note as one of the best gateway anime. It has likeable characters a great atmosphere and a musical soundtrack that has stuck in my head for years. That all being said it is also one of the most overated animes out there though for understandable reasons. ",4817,134,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Whenever I've talked to a person about anime I've always wound up mentioning this series ...if ever there was a series I'd recommend to both newcomers and veterans alike its this one .    what truly makes this series shine is the cool atmosphere the story and most of all the characters .   In some ways this anime is utterly beautiful if anyone ever told me that anime wasn't an art form this is the series I'd use as an example of how wrong they are .  It's philosophical aspects are wonderful aswell and its certainly worth taking the time to watch it beginning to end because it undoubtibly has one of the most memorable endings in anime I've ever seen.,4818,135,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"This is the overall classic for me. It was really my first anime when I started watching it on Adult Swim. While the animation is a little dated by todays standards it fits the style of the story and does not look bad at all. I have never been a big stickler for sound quality so as long as it's clear (which it is) I tend to enjoy it. The song choices were pretty good as well the church scene in Ballad of Fallen Angels as an example. All the characters just about were rememorable for various reasons. Even the bounty targets they chased had their own unique (although some cliche) personalities. ",4819,136,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you want to watch a unique anime you should try Cowboy Bebop. The cool about this anime series is that the story-line it is  not made as an common anime story that you have to watch every single episode to catch with it. Cowboy bebop show the lives of four bounty hunters in the future.,4820,137,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If there was ever a flawless anime then Cowboy Bebop is the one.  The STORY follows four characters - Jet Faye Edward and Spike- as they travel the Universe as bounty hunters with their own reasons. (We could count Ein as a main character too).  Although the first few episodes seem like it's just going to be a bit of a random episode with the three characters fighting crime and being borderline criminal themselves the plot line soon picks up as we meet other interesting characters like Julia and Vicious and explore the pasts of each crew member.,4821,138,2019-04-13 21:35:40
to be honest its been a long time since ive seen this but frome what i remember it was a good show at the time and at that time i was still a lil kid but now i think its still a good show to start on and ya it had good action senes and maybe one day i might rewatch it,4822,139,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I really enjoyed Cowboy Bebop as the story pulls you in. Each character has their own story to tell and all through-out the series you find out each one's past and where they hope to go in life. From Ed finding her father to Spike finding Julia. The action sequences are entertaining as well and the music of Cowboy Bebop just blows me away.,4823,140,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Cowboy Bebop is one of those shows that's giving you exactly what you'd expect it to. It's about a group of space bounty hunters chasing after and fighting criminals wherever they go. Despite its episodic nature I personally had little problems working my way through the episodes.,4825,142,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story: 2 bounty hunters a woman gambler a young female hacker and a genius dog  travel through space hunting down criminals for their bounties while Bebop/jazz/and rocknroll play in the background. Amazingly as awesome as that sounds its actually a million times more awesome than that. Each episode is a self contained story that has the characters hunting down the bounty of the week. While that may seem like there is very little plot in reality the continuity between episodes the occasional strong expositional episode coupled with amazing character development culminates in a beautiful and amazing finale that will leave you in tears. No seriously I cried like a baby Im still not ok.,4842,150,2019-04-13 21:35:40
One of the only animes I've watched that I've enjoyed all the way through. One of my all-time favorites. A must watch for any anime fan.,4848,151,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,4849,152,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The most classic of the classic anime's that I've ever watched. The visuals of the show was awesome and stunning. The characters are great and is also the biggest high life of the anime. The sound and the VA's of the English dubbed were great and as the subbed also the best. The story is what really makes Cowboy Bebop one of the best in the anime franchises. It being set about the characters and their past is the best part and my favorite thing about the anime. Because most of the newer anime don't really go into detail with the characters in the show. The best of the best is what I'm go at the entire anime. ,4851,153,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is the sole reason I've watched as much anime as I have. I keep searching and searching watching and waiting for something as epic as this show. Each time I watch this show I'm blown away by how amazing the music and animation is especially for being an older anime. Just try and not cry in this show. ,4852,154,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story was missing some depth each episodes were individually interesting and were not displeasant but the serie as a whole was missing a lot in developpement. If the whole serie would have been like the 2 last episodes of each end of season then it would have been a wonderfull memorable serie. Unfortunetely it is not the case.,4856,158,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was a decent little anime considering it only have one episode and would probably been a tear jerker had it been more in depth. The characters were very cute especially Flower. It was sweet he kept her with him in some way after she passed. I kind of wonder who her old owner was and why he disgarded her :/ Watch if you like!,4884,166,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Pretty enjoyable series of shorts all around was funny moe and fanservecy as expected.    The shorts range from about a minute to over six minutes so easy to watch entirely in one setting .     I recommend watching them to anyone who's completed the main series as it provides a little extra content and here's hoping there's a season 2.,4890,168,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:  I will admit I started this anime with high hopes.  Created by Shaft Maria Holic has the same creators as Bakemonogatari which I found to be brilliant.  However what I encountered was utter disappointment.  Maria Holic is the story of Miss Miyamae who transfers to Ame no Kisaki an all girls school so that she may seek true love with a beautiful girl.  Miyamae has a deep seeded hatred for boys and breaks out in hives whenever she is touched by a member of the opposite sex.  The day before school starts she meets a beautiful girl from her school named Mariya only to find out that Mariya is actually a boy who is cross-dressing in order to attend this school.  All this is set up in the first episode.  It sounds interesting on paper but this is actually all there really is to the story.  I understand it’s a slice of life anime but every other episode except the first felt like filler.  I am usually forgiving with those episodes but when a show feels like 11 episodes of filler with only 1 relating to plot that is a bad sign.  I will admit that some of the shenanigans that the main character gets into are worth a giggle or two but that is about the only worth the story has to the show.,4907,174,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Lets get this out of the way first this show is a full on comedy. And gladly most of the time its incredibly funny.,4918,178,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Maria-Holic is a 12 episode romantic comedy ecchi pseudo-harem anime with themes of cross-dressing and same gender relationships. Off the bat this sounds like an idea that will fall apart from inevitable anime pitfalls a boy pretending to be a girl in an all-girl school being paired with a yuri girl who hates men so much she can’t even touch one. Psuedo harem refers to it being neither a traditional harem nor reverse-harem more a mix of the two. It’s all or nothing for this one. I wish I was able to do my drunk marathons this would have been perfect for it. I’ll also detail my dislike for ecchi harem and pointless pervy fan-service please take this into account when reading my reviews. No review is perfectly unbiased and opinion creeps in even sub-consciously.,4921,179,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Welcome to my tenth community anime review for Anime-Planet. This review I am taking a gander at Studio Ghibli's 1988 film Grave of the Fireflies.

Jesus Christ. Here I am choking up just thinking of my first watch of the film last night. There is literally nothing wrong with this movie. The characters are some of the most relatable I have ever seen. There are no faults with movie. Just pop it in and prepare to cry. Easily the greatest anime movie of all time and maybe one of the best movies of all time.,4938,189,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you don’t shed more than a thousand tears for this movie…you have no soulthats my review this movie was damn sad but so excellent ,4948,195,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First off all I don't feel like this movie was meant to be a tear jerker which is what i was originally expecting. Yes.. there were sad moments but but they were all down played by Seita's emotionless reactions to all of these situations. Its understandable that he is trying to be brave for his sister but come on... seeing your mother like that would make anyone cry. ,4961,196,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Oh my Jesus...I was a sobbing mess after this one. This. was. Pain. I had to pause the film at the end to grab tissues since my face was melting off. Simply gorgeous and heartbreakingly perfect. I will cherish this. The feeling I had at the end was something I wanted to hold on to (possibly because I'm massochistic or something along those lines) sorry people I like depressing shit. Especially if the scenery is well done and the characters are relatable. This movie has definitely aged well and still resonates with people of a different demographic and age group. Sometimes I just want to watch something that will make me cry and will force me to use my brain and this gave me what I wanted and more so bravvaaaa good form.,4991,205,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Grave of the Fireflies is by far one of the best war films I have ever seen. While it may be very sad I think it is a good movie to watch and is probably the most down-to-earth movie produced by Studio Ghibli.,5002,208,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The only Ghilbi Studio movie that made me miserable but I didn't cry - well I might if I watch it the second time. XD  I hated the fact that the whole family dies one by one (first the mother then the father then the little girl D': and the teenage boy). I enjoyed the art work very much but the story didn't appeal to me since it was too sad for me to watch and the Aunt really pissed me off. ,5014,212,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie is basically the same as the first 6 episodes of the anime with a few differences I'm not going to watch them side by side and list every difference but I only noticed any real change with the fifth angel (Ramiel)... he seems alot more powerful in this.  In the anime he stayes an octahedron the whole time.  In this he changes into several different shapes.  I don't have much else to say... It's the same thing as the anime.,5018,215,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie is about what you would expect it's pretty much the entire series condensed down to a movie version.  Though luckly or prehaps unlucky depending on how you feel about the Evangelion series it's spread out over 4 movies with 1.0 being the first.  This first movie covers the first three angel battles.  Which to say isn't a bad thing since are probably the best thing about the Evangelion series.  Besides the battles you get what you would expect some character building but where the movie differs in this from the televsion series is that the movie for the most part only focuses on Shinji which is of course a good and a bad thing.  Since we're no longer forced to deal with all the drama that the other characters have but at the sametime we're still stuck with listening to what a whiny brat Shinji is.  Though he was slighly more tolerable in the movie which I can think of several reasons as to why this might be.  The animation was overall only okay it for the most part didn't really stand out at all and for the most part seemed to be lacking a certain something that other movies have that have come out in recent years.  Though I will say that the battles scenes were really something to watch.  If you need only one reason to watch this movie then that reason would have to be for the angel battles.  Unless of course you're a person who doesn't like action then that of course would be a reason for you not to watch this.  The sound is pretty much classic Evangelion with I think some of the old soundtrack making something of a return in the movie that all fit in well and didn't seem like they were out of date in the slightest bit.  As for the characters well Shinji is still for the most part Shinji and I'm not going to say anything more on him or else I'll end up ranting for who knows how long.  The other characters do seem to get a lot less screen time in the movie with characters like Misato for the most part only make a real appearance during the battle scenes and Rei not getting and real screen time until the last portion of the movie.  Though this is only the first movie so they're bound to get more later on.  Overall if you hated Evangelion in the past then you'll probably not going to come to like the movie all that much more.  I for one still deeply hate Evangelion and only have a somewhat better opinion of the first movie.  Truth be told the only reason I'm probably giving the movie such a high score is probably because Shinji annoyed me a lot less this time around.,5025,220,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Evangelion: 1.0 You are (not) alone is the first of a modern movie remake of the cult classic 90s anime Neon Genesis Evangelion equivalent to the first few episodes. The original anime is one of my favourite anime of all time being joint second in my top 3 anime. I almost wasn’t going to review this anime movie due to my inherent bias and opinion but I figured it would be useful to folks to see a review from someone who loved the original. Thus I must disclose that I absolutely loved the original and its movie sequel I love the psychological genre of anime which messes with your head and I hate all things fan-service and ecchi. I will refer to the original in this review. This movie remake trilogy is very similar to another anime franchise Berserk which was also a very old anime TV series. Like Evangelion it had a HD trilogy of movie remakes but in my opinion those movie remakes weren’t as good as the original. Since I watched them long ago there’s fat chance that I’ll ever review those but the movie remakes removed some of the interesting and shocking themes of the original added more unnecessary nudity (the movie remake has visible genitalia both genders) and added a thing that was apparently in the manga which I don’t read. So it’ll be interesting to see how the anime industry has evolved since the early 90s and what difference it makes to this anime remake. If one hasn’t watched the original 1994 anime I recommend you go back and watch it along with the sequel movie End of Evangelion before watching this remake.,5027,221,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I've been an Evangelion fan for a long time. It was the first anime series that didn't even seem like it was anime to me. It seemed like an art film written by Freud God and Anno. So when I heard they were re-doing the series I raged.  They're gonna screw up the story and the characters they're going to ruin perfection!  is what I thought. Oh how I was wrong. Not only did they bring it back but they punched a hole in my logic. This movie was great. It retained all the bleakness and nightmare fuel of the original but now it actually seems like an anime not an animated suicide note. I still love the original but I also love seeing the series from a more happy light. It pulls it off because it isn't a remake it's a reimagining minor tweaks making it either scarier or cheerier maybe both. Fact is if you loved the original you might wanna put on two pairs of socks. Cause this one is gonna blow them off. Plus Colleen Clinkenbeard as Ritsuko? Awesome.,5030,224,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is so great ! ,5041,232,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Into the first few episodes i was comfortable with the direction of the series. Onizuka decides to become a teacher but has diffuculties when he keeps creating setbacks for himself. Many of the episodes focus on the development of the characters. Onisuka as the teacher gets to be in charge of a classroom full of troubled kids. These kids all seem to have a reason to hate all teachers. So Onisuka tries to win everyone over by solving the problems that the kids have. The story seems to flow nicely as it deals with the relationship between the classmates otherwise the episodes are fairly episodic.,5042,233,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,5043,234,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is very interesting and funny. Main characters has best emotions and the athmosphere is best. Anime is full of funny jokes especially main character Onizuka. :D,5045,235,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hello all,5060,242,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I love how this started out as a romantic comedy and they seem to have decided to hell with the romance and go straight for the comedy instead. This series has a very diverse set of characters in which everyone can relate too. By far one of the best comedy series of 2014. It’s a good show to watch if you need a good laugh or two,5065,243,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Magi is sooo awesomebut the second season disappointed me a little bit.The awesome trio had to split upit was really sad.Magi also has amazing openingsbut the characters are kinda forgettable.There are too many charactersi forget their names very fastbut each character is special and amazing.Magi should be the number 1 most watched anime of all times.,5072,246,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is great. I still gave it only a 2.5 star rating. The ending of season one made me not want to even bother watching season 2. All the way up until the last episode I loved this anime. It was funny but still made me cry. I loved the characters even the ones I also hated. When the characters were happy I was happy with them. When they were sad so was I. But I was even more sad when that last episode rolled around and the anime decided to be completely predictable lame and unoriginal. I spent the last ten minutes of the episode thinking  stupidest. ending. ever.  over and over a mantra that emulates my feelings even now that it's over. Maybe even more so. I wish I could simply rewrite the ending of this and make it how I will but that means I wouldn't be able to watch the second season which leads me to why I don't even want to bother.,5074,247,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I can't think of any flaws within this show except for maybe Alibaba's way of yelling out obvious statements and making everything sound cheesy......though that's just in the dub. I give the story a perfect score because most shows always make the characters go on an adventure for some super deep reason  but this one lets them go on an adventure just to strike it rich! (And later other reasons) The animation was extremely appealing to me for some reason the soundtracks were the bomb and some of these characters were just beautiful........both main and secondary characters alike. Especially people like Morgiana and KASSIM <3 and Judar. Can't forget Judar. Anyway this show was really really good in my opinion. If you haven't already I suggest you watch it. I found it to be worth the watch. True this is an incredibly short review but just. Watch. It. NOW. ,5084,253,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I personally was intrigued by an Arabian Nights theme but then I grew to love these characters. The story is very original drawing from the 1001 Nights without following it directly. Aladdin is an adorable character who is quite easy to laugh at along with Alibaba. As the story progesses more characters are introduced making the interactions better and much much funnier.,5085,254,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a very enjoyable anime. I certainly am enjoying catching up on the second season. It's filled with adventure fantasy and good-natured fun. My friend and I keep relating the show and its many aspects to RPGs we've played.,5088,255,2019-04-13 21:35:40
With so many characters different point of views and all this isn't the usal type of anime I would like. However I love it!! It's very unique. Set in an Arabic style scene and time it has action  adventure fantasy drama slice of life a bit of romance and a bit of mystery. The storyline is an epic journey where the three main characters meet and go through adventures together and individually. It's more real life based. Some characters in this show die get hurt and/or go through a change of heart and mindset. The characters grow with their experience. ,5089,256,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Ever since the Anime adaptation of  Hunter x Hunter  ended I have had a massive feeling of emptiness in my heart that has never truly been filled up by any other Shounen type series.

"     Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei has been quite a popular anime. Let's start with the main character Nozomu Itoshiki or should i say Mr.Despair? he is undoubtedly the most (if not) negative person Japan ever had. One day he met an absolute positive thinker girl whom irritatingly seems to be not believing in anything said in TV or newspapers. This meeting unexpectedly changed his fate forever. Nozomu himself is a highschool teacher unfortuantely for him the girl he just met is actually his homeroom student. Not just that but almost the whole class is actually pretty unique themselves.

Story: The story is rather jumbled in this anime. It's basically Itoshiki getting to know his class of rather eccentric students while at the same time trying to teach them about the despair of the world. His attempts to spread his pessimism is thwarted by Kafuka the eternal optomist and several other members of the class. The story itself leaves a lot to be desired but the humor and situations make up for the missing plot.,5132,274,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei is a pure sketch comedy set in high school even more so than anime such as Azumanga Daioh. There is no plot no character development and humor can be random and nonsensical at times.,5133,275,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The anime introduces many characters right away; some of the characters are interesting enough but then more characters are introduced out of no where and it just gets overwhelming.

I'm not really going to go in-depth with this review. All I have to say is that the story was really choppy and jumpy. It barely qualified as a Shounen-ai. The fight scenes were a joke and the dialogue was terrible. It was so cheesy and unoriginal. If you're into all that then that's fine but even then I think that it would make more sense if you played or know about the game. It was just bad.

The STORY of 3 x 3 Eyes - Seima Densetsu was so much more tolerable for me than it's series predecessor.  I loved the fact that Yoko was a snake who had such personality!  And I thought that the characters really carried this OVA and made it a lot better than the first.  In this OVA Pai has become Pavarti and does not remember anything about wanting to become human or that she isn't even a human and Yakumo has set out to find her and remind her of who she is and of their quest.,5190,303,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Despite the decent grade for animation this anime has nothing and I mean nothing to save it. The emotional scale is up-down-lup-down-left-right-left-right-a-b-start... no wait that's the Konami code. This was so bad I had to keep stopping to look at something else to calm myself down from wanting to beat the writers.,5191,304,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Its a shame to see it ended how it did I was hoping for so much more it had so much potential I honestly think if it ended the way the manga did it could of been one of the best anime series ever. The characters are half decent the one you like you love those ones you don't you hate (raki in particular) good backstory for the protagonist but it didn't explain everything like the manga did. This is an example of good series turning terrible purely due to the end as it leaves everything to open and completely diverges from the manga after the third major incident as it is only 25 episodes long it's an easy watch and the only story related problem is the end and if you want to love it you have to the read the manga. Some of the music is outta place at times the voice actors aren't awful except raki but the may be partially because of the things his character come out with the fights are interesting and a major turning point early on is very unexpected overall good series but it should of been so much more.,5200,311,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I just ... don't understand what happened. Did they switch writer halfway through? Did I somehow miss a chunk of episodes?,5208,317,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is by far my fav anime... I stopped watching anime from the years 1995 to 2007.. I saw a few anime movies in that time but I'd mostly lost interest in animes... It was this anime and Vandread that got me to start watching anime again and its became my obsession ever since. Now I watch anime everyday. I'm not really sure what about this anime that caught my interest it wasn't the first episode I actually saw several episodes into it before I went an watched it all from the beginning when Teresa was in the anime the prequel if you will is when I first saw this anime. It wasn't the kiddie anime I'd seen years earlier it was hardcore gritty action packed an anime that had teeth and wasn't made for children. Its the anime that got me to love anime all over again as an adult.,5209,318,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There are already many reviews on  Claymore  but i just had to express my views on it. Let me start by saying this anime was extremely disappointing. It started out really strong with a solid base and a great promise for the future but somewhere along the middle it literally decomposed  to a pile of mush.,5223,327,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Claymore is overall a pretty mediocre anime. The main characters are fairly weak and annoying while the side characters are far more interesting. The little boy in this anime whines all the time and doesn't stop even after you turn the TV off. Then you go to the bar... Get drunk and the voices go away.,5225,328,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really enjoyed Claymore.  It's different from a lot of the cut and dry anime that are around nowadays.  While I bet most people quite liked the animation I like the cartoony look.  Claymore has more of a real-life-style animation.  It was weird for me at first but I got used to it after a couple of episodes.,5228,330,2019-04-13 21:35:40
AMAZING!!!! 10/10 everyone watch this right now,5231,331,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Yes I am a raving fan of Claymore. I totally have a fanime crush on Claire. I want to see more of her. I wasn't done watching this when they decided that the end should be there. I'm pretty sure but in the manga the story continues on. In the manga I don't remember her actually fighting priscilla.,5233,333,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story 7 : why did i give it a seven ? Well because it jumps around  it wasnt really consitistance. One moment Clare is fight  then there would be a flash back with Terssa . It was really confusing until they got done with it .,5234,334,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,5235,335,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't usually watch this genre of anime and Claymore has reminded me why.,5238,337,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,5240,338,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the anime that got me into watching other kinds of anime. By far this is still my favorite. There is action blood & gore and also unexpected things. It's not a typical story you can predict.,5241,339,2019-04-13 21:35:40

While I find the manga the better of the two the anime does follow very closely up until the end and I highly reccomend watching and reading both versions. I've read the manga all the way through 8 times so you can tell I love it,5251,344,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"I went into this expecting mediocer stuff. but i got an amazing story about robots and how humans react to the situation the future has brought them. These robots are called Boomers and they look feel and do everything like a human can do. Suprisingly being from the earlt 2000's it has a lot of sex in it.

Great story Line about how dreams can come true with dedication and never giving up. I did not like how it ended though there should have been another season instead of a weird animated children bubble animation that does NOT continue the store. There was NOT enough romance. It could have been better but its a great one to watch for inspiring reasons. ,5274,358,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kaleido Star to me is a very inspirational and unique anime. The story got me so hooked I really wished there was a kaleido stage around where I live so I could watch a show! Haha,5278,361,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This series will make you feel like you can do anything! It is a great motivational tool and provides great positive inspiration.  The main character's determination is so empowering.  I can't recommend this enough to every anime fan - and even to those who are not anime fans! I don't see how anyone in the world could not get hooked on this absolutely magical and beautiful series.,5281,363,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Dragonball has a new series Sailor Moon has been revived and JoJo is no-longer an OAV I think I smacked my head on a time machine and woke up in the 90s.  Here comes another very simple straight forward shonen from that era.,5288,366,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Honestly I originally did not even want to watch this Anime. It sounded incredibly over-hyped and I recently started disliking Harem related Anime due to the impossible idiocy of the Main Protagonist in every single one of them.,5289,367,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story is amazingand the characters are lovable.I love everything about this anime except the quantity....The funny scenes were really hilariousbut i hope that the 2nd season will come out soon...,5291,369,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Not sure if i like this one or not. Well it had its moments(ecchi stuff) but i did not feel that the story progressed at all. ,5292,370,2019-04-13 21:35:40
FIRST EPISODE IMPRESSIONS OF TRINITY SEVEN,5293,371,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Very good anime good story and good characters with a soundtrack i personally found enjoyable as it just felt right for the anime itself a great anime to watch if you like to watch magic based battles but unfortunately not many happen and not alot happen within the battles themselves but still enjoyable to watch by this i mean the battles were rather short spanning usualy within 1 episode but the only downside to the anime was the story felt very fast paced and progressed through important parts very quickly.,5296,372,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was berry surprised about this anime at first when I saw the first episode I was like what is this but as I went in I really got into it like how the main character is a demon Lord candidate. And in order to get back his friend he has to become a mage at first this might sound silly but when you start watching it you will be surprised like I was I sure of it :D.,5298,373,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Pretty much all solid eights in my opinion. The story is a bit dark (holding up to the tag 'revenge') but also has plenty of light moments that balance it out. The characters are well done but leave a few questions unanswered that might be answered by the manga. I thought the animation was pretty smooth especially when it came to the action.,5306,379,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Top 10er. This series is the 1st I owned in single cased individually bought sets it contains 7 discs and I can name every episode and explain it too you. So if you have any questions feel free to ask me. Takes place in 19th century Japan during the Edo period before the meiji restoration and centres around the building of a fictional character called Tetsunoske Ichimura in the Shinsengumi before there big raid on the Ikedaya. This show is amazing musically visually and educationally I love it with all my passion,5308,381,2019-04-13 21:35:40

As someone relatively new to anime the biggest thing that drew me in to this particular series was the main characters: good strong female leads who aren't the brunt of ecchi scenes fanservice and loads of panty shots which are all things that seem to be just all over any shounen series with female characters. In addition two of the four main characters don't even have any of the powers that the other two do so it's very touching to see the unique ways in which their own personal strengths show through as well.,5321,387,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To Aru Kagaku no Railgun can simply be described as a heart-pounding suspenseful dramatic and overly lovable anime that will leave you wanting more. I came across the anime while browsing through an anime site and I had decided to watch it as it struck me as  intriguing at the time. After I had watched the first episode I decided immediatley that I was going to watch even more. That cycle continued as the plot is designed to never have a dull moment. Where one part of the story ends the next part picks up pace without haste. It is that that had kept pulling me back into the series. I eventually finished that first season in sorrow for the fact that I had thought that was all the series had to it but I was wrong. Excitement overwhelmed me when I came across the second installment of the series in that website's series listings. I absolutely didn't want the series to end as it unfortunatly had after the second season came to an end. The story and plotline is the best that I have come across yet and I doubt that I will ever find another anime that comes close to the purely lovable one in this anime title.,5322,388,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Alright so To Aru Kagaku no Railgun is one of those anime that focuses on a lot with powers. The powers in this anime would be esper powers. The plot was amazing it's most likely one of the best plotlines I've seen. The story is split into two major arcs. The same conflict persists in both making the two arcs strongly connected. I really enjoyed this structure and how the story plays out will keep you thinking  What will happen next? . There are of course a fair share of filler episodes providing breaks in between arcs. But given how great the arcs were I can overlook the fillers even though the anime could've gone without them.,5332,391,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,5333,392,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I remember when I first watched To Aru Kagaku no Railgun (I will be calling it  Railgun  for the rest of this review). The only animes that I had watched beforehand were Pokemon Code Geass Mirai Nikki and Helsing Ultimate. I will just say that I loved pretty much every moment of it! So now I will review each point that I have rated:,5337,393,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It says that the first Anime you watch is the best one.  Well I have to agree completly. I enjoyed every single episode from the beginning. I'm so glad I started watching Animes.,5341,394,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I am posting this general review across :,5342,395,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've been reading reviews and I'm disappointed at the two opposites in opinnions: those regarding it as stupid abusive and non-sense; and those perverts claiming the sex scenes are of the best they've seen. I differ from both and I believe there is more than meets the eye when it comes to Fusanosuke Inariya's works.,5343,396,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was the first yaoi I ever watched and I've been hooked on it ever since the story and characters are great the animation is a little bit too old but not that bad so all in all I think it a great yaoi and would recommend to anyone who likes hard core yaoi ,5344,397,2019-04-13 21:35:40
With possibly the exceptions of 'Boku no Pico' (extreme shotacon) and 'Boku no Sexual Harassment' (the scene with the bondage and all the prostitution) this is the most shocking yaoi-related thing I have ever watched. I have been informed that the manga of 'Maiden Rose' is good but the OVA seems to highlight one particular thing: the rape. I can't morally get past that part so it did rather kill the series for me since I was too busy sitting in front of my computer with a rather confused and mildly horrified expression on my face to really comprehend what else was going on. As a result it's rather difficult to review. ,5347,398,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I have to admit to a bit of a bias. Any genre of work containing theord  romance  generally disgusts me and romantic comedies are noxception. I have a tendency to not even get through first episodes.his was true for my first two or three attempts at getting into Schoolumble I just didn't find the first episode funny enough to justifyatching a genre I disliked.,5365,404,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is one of my favorite animes ever!  I didn't expect it to be so hilarious.  It kept me wanting more and more as I watched each episode.  The characters really develop after every episode and they are all unique in their own way.  The English voice actors did a very amazing job and fit their characters very well!  Though not much romance was involved and I really love romance animes it was still very good.  School Rumble has made me laugh over and over til my stomach hurt.  If you have not watched the first or second season yet you need to!,5395,413,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,5397,415,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I had heard this one was absolutely hilarious not really.  It had a few moments where I literally busted out laughing and it was lovely but those moments were few and far between so this show mainly left me with a lot of filler and no real progress made in the story.  This show is kind of a tease.  100 times Tenma/Harima would rev up for their confessions and then nothing.  It became taxing.  I think you were just meant to enjoy the Seinfeld-like plot of a show about nothing and a humor based on just miss encounters and irony and at times it worked.  I enjoyed most the almost love story with Yakumo and Sawachika for Harima most.  Harima was a very cute character as well I like the idea that a delinquent type is actually a hugely sensitive and lovey and gets as spastic around his crush as anyone more so than anyone in the show.  As far as Tenma and her crush I felt as if the boy was so robotic because he was just meant to be a placeholder for Tenma until her real love story started with Harima.  Banking on that I'll watch the second season in hopes that with a groundwork laid a lot more will happen next.  ,5398,416,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one those anime's that past me by and I never looked back. It took many years from a friend telling me to check it out before I did and boy I cant belive I passed this one up for so long!,5399,417,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Muteki Kanban Musume,5403,421,2019-04-13 21:35:40
back when this came out I dropped it flat cuz it looked a bit...odd? Well whatever I actually just finished it and I LOVED IT!. It really reminded me of air master although it's not as graceful and it doesn't really have a long plot to it however the randomness of this anime is what I actually liked from a girl throwing chalk at someone to a dog constantly wanting to attack and challenge our beloved main character so the story was a bit jumbled at times so what? I'm pretty sure MOST of us could say we rewound the part at the start where Miki falls over then ends up kicking some poor soul in the face while burning some other guy with ramen am I right?! :) well even if you didn't it's safe to say you laughed like a fool aloud while shouting  what in the world just happened!? Why!? How!? What!?  Anyways what I'm saying is that overall I really loved this show and whoever didn't I don't really blame you since the jokes were iffy sometimes and I'm definatly not saying it doesn't have flaws just that the overall show did entertain all the way through to the end. It most definatly served well.,5408,422,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Muteki Kanban Musume is a great Anime. I loved it from the first episode to the last. Each episode has two parts to it and two different stories and each episode is different. That is what I like about this Anime. It was random funny and the characters were awesome. I really enjoyed this Anime also because it was about Ramen. It is not like any Anime I have every seen; its random funny and has a good mood to it. I guess thats why I like it so much. Anyway I suggest you give it a chance. You will never know until you try! Overall 9/10. If only they made more episodes then I would give it a 10/10!,5411,423,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So why is Ping Pong such a special anime? It is a blast not only for the senses but for the mind as well. As it was directed by Masaaki Yuasa the man behind Kaiba and Tatami Galaxy it is no wonder. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.,5420,426,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tl;dr: One of the most original and exciting anime in recent memory. ,5424,429,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The premise of Ping Pong: The Animation is to provide an insight into the lives of a group of young Ping Pong players who play at the highest level of competition for their age group. The show’s protagonist Tsukimoto who bears the nickname Smile due to his unfriendly and joyless disposition is reluctantly put through a harsh training regime by an old veteran of the sport; Butterfly Jo. Charming well-paced and clichéd in all the right ways (see classic reluctant relationship between mentor and pupil) whilst still feeling original and packed full of well-developed and relatable characters Ping Pong offers a very rewarding journey to its viewers.,5427,430,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kara no Kyoukai Movie 7: Satsujin Kousatsu (Part 2) is a slow paced and methodical psychological thriller with some supernatural elements. In itself it is actually rather good. Compared to the rest of the series it is by far the most mature and deliberate of all the offerings. Sure there is some angst there is some darkness but the tone of the movie is almost like a classic detective film.,5440,432,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This is definetly my favourite series! *-*,5449,434,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story: This is a pretty original anime. I haven't found many animes based on the mafia and when i do its never the Italian mob its always Yakuza. Aside from that im growing tired of the whole super powered thing. It would have still been a great anime if they stuck with traditional mob weaponry rather than fantasy warfare. Another fault was it's slow start. At first its a very day to day living type arc and it happens 3 times through out the series too many as far as im concerned.,5454,435,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is one of the few animes that left me wanting for more once it was over and left me feeling excited at the end of every episode even though i watched one after the other since it had already ended. Many people complain about the first few episodes that ended around the 20 episodes before the main storyline kicks in but i just consider that character development and did actually enjoy it. I highly recomend this and it easily makes my top 5.,5455,436,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is very awesome and have an amazing story. The fight scene's are amazing and the comedy is quite hilarrious. For those of you who like Comedy and Action come and watch this anime. Also they have a manga going on every week so be sure to read it ;D,5460,438,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So 203 episodes and what to say about it? It's shounen that's sure but in my opinion it's for younger audience who won't think about it so deep as me.,5462,439,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kateikyoshi Hitman Reborn! (katekyo hitman reborn)  is an anime that was created from a manga featured in shonun jump comics.,5466,441,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"If your looking for a show with action and charm I definitely suggest looking into this one. There are times that you'll laugh and times where you get swallowed up by the story. Although like all shows that run for a long time this show has it's downside as well. I spent a lot of time forwarding through review after it got into the action episodes and the first twenty or so episodes are basically just character introduction that could have been done much faster. however despite this I still believe the show to be a very good watch. Once it reaches the fighting episodes and tsuna(the main character) starts to grow stronger it becomes difficult to put down. ",5468,442,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What?! A wimpy teenager is the boss of the strongest Mafia?  can't say that isnt cliche but there is a twist to this. The main character never changes his cowardly personality. And can you blame him? His tutor is a little kid. But Tsunayoshi sawada will still find many comrades to join his mafia and become his guardians. Protecting him with their very lives. Just dont let tsuna get deathperate thats when he's scary. ,5469,443,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn is an amazing anime but has one masive flaw. It takes for freaking ever to get going. The writers thought it would be a good idea to trick you into thinking that this show will nothing more than a bad comide and then at episode 20 it goes all shonan on you. Saddy even though there are a lot of fillers and they aren't funny you have to watch them in order to get the full glory that is later episodes. The characters become so deep and you find yourself wishing they were real. The story is anything but pradicable. You never know what is going to happen and it never sticks to one mold. The music isn't all that unique unitle something epic happens. Then the trumpics start playing. I get goosebumps everytime.,5474,446,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:,5476,448,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Katekyo Hitman Reborn is one of my favourite anime of all time! (tied with Attack on Titan :P ) It's starts off (in my opinion) boring slow and anti-climactic  which leaded me to considering dropping the whole show. Thank God i continued. After the first 20 episodes things started to speed up and action is packed in every episode beyond that point. katekyo Hitman Reborn always kept me on my toes and wanting more. Reborn provided such lovable character that provided comedy drama action and more. This anime provides 203 episodes of pure amazing...stuff. The art style (especially in fight scenes) is well done and ups the whole experience. This anime is not appreciated enough. I highly recommend this anime to anyone regardless of you preferences no harm in trying. ,5477,449,2019-04-13 21:35:40
its a pretty amzing story judg it after watching 30 episodes. first 20 episodes are basically character development and you have to watch them other wise it would feel weird watching this anime.,5478,450,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I keep reading the reviews online that if you keep watching this anime gets pretty good. But there are just so many times that you can repeat exactly the same joke far less if its a bad joke so if you don't like the first 2 episodes you won't like the anime as it basically repeats the same on every episode. The fights are pretty good but I just couldn't stand so many monotonous fillers in between fights. Finally it drove me crazy at episode 67 I did my best to keep an open mind and give this anime a try but it just let me down!,5493,454,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kinda sucks,5521,464,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is the first of the series that I watched. It is called a movie and therefore I tried it as such. Well this  movie  is short with a plot that is too short to be called interesting a lot of character bits around the plot which don't really matter as this is too short a time to develop characters. So perhaps my problem with Kara no Kyoukai Movie 1: Fukan Fuukei is that in essence it is a lie: you should not watch it as a stand-alone thing. As to watching it as part of a series I'll get back to you on that come the epilogue.,5522,465,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"This series rocks. I just couldn't stop watching this series. The main character Shiki  just draws you in and each episode takes you to a different place in time. There is lots of suspense murder heartbreak love and drama to keep you glued to the television. It's gothic enough for those in love with that genre. It's hardcore. I absolutely loved it. ",5526,467,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners - Overlooking View is a 50 minute supernatural mystery movie featuring a little action which I would also designate a seinen. It’s the first in a series of movies based upon a trio of light novels by Kinoko Nasu and is part of Type-Moon’s works which include similar anime like Lunar Legend Tsukihime and the Fate series. I just started reading the novels last week and I’ve been putting off these movies as I want to read the original material beforehand. It is in fact set in the same world as those other anime in particular it seems to be heavy related to Tsukihime and even Fate.,5529,468,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This OVA series never once let me down. The ending was great thection was great the story was great and furthermore everything getsesolved. THAT is one thing I’m so happy about. I can’t describe inords as toow great this set of movies is was and are. I don’t really know howccuratehis is in accordance to the books but in regards to that it waswesome.his was good enough to replace Berserk which was originally my numberne. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes horror drama goreore and more gore. And to top it off this story is by TYPE-MOON.,5530,469,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kara no Kyoukai has a pretty distinguishable atmosphere and style for a start. Usually in supernatural/bordeline horror anime we have a lot of action scary musci and such but here these are more or less absent. So for starters Ill try to define its genre: psycho-thriller would fit it best maybe psychologycal horror. The following review will be about all of the movies not just the first one.  ,5534,470,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Waiting in the summer was a nice anime ever seen its a scifi mecha twist but into romance part. The animation are well nice made but I have such many expectations if its comes to animation but there's only some animates that disappoints me. The sound well I like the opening and also the ending. The characters Its one sided each character and they are each screen view  I do like one sideds so I made this a 9 overall 9.7/10 in this anime ^.^,5548,482,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I wasn't blinded by the LSD colored animation I was having anerism from everything that was happening in the jarred storyline. I could only stand a single episode with some friends who have agreed to scarecly ever mention its name. The characters were barely memorable all I remember was that some guy who was stabbed by his mother then got taken care of by a panty-shot girl who happened to be his twin sister or something.,5560,494,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This movie is definetely not one of Miyazaki's best films but it's very memorable and if you watched it as a little kid it would definetely bring you back memories as well as his other film Kiki's Delivery Service. This time it focuses on two little girls set in the 50s who live in a Haunted House with their father while their mother is ill in the hospital.,5571,504,2019-04-13 21:35:40

With a director like Miyazaki (Kiki's Delivery Service Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away) and music by Hisaishi this movie is sure to make an impression.

I always recommend that my friends watch the first episode without reading the description and skipping through the intro song. I did this completely by accident and boy was I in for a surprise! The pleasure of watching that shock on my roommate's face was just as satisfying as feeling it myself. If you haven't watched the anime yet then don't spoil it for yourself -- do what I just recommended and THEN decide if you want to invest your life in its 12 episodes.,5602,523,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime has one huge thing going for it- being extremely unique. It is unlike anything I've ever seen in that it balances a feel of a stereotypical moe happy-go-lucky slice of life anime with the horror and survival aspects of being the last survivors of a zombie apocalypse. The contrast between these two very diffferent genres is so big and yet this anime pulls off both rather nicely. Perhaps that is even why it will be so successful.,5606,526,2019-04-13 21:35:40
School-Live! is one of the biggest cases of misleading in recent memory. The first episode completely blew my mind with the very well-executed and shocking revelation. However at that point I was worried this might turn into something Corpse Party where the cute characters are just there for the sake of killing them in gruesome ways without giving us any chance at liking them. After watching this anime through I am glad to say it exceeds even my highest expectations.,5607,527,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Spoiler free. This is one of those genre switchers. They are a hybrid of several different genres in anime that one doesn't normally see together at this strength. For example Gargantia on a Verdant Planet from Ep 1 looks like Knights of Sidonia a military science fiction adventure/death drama. Then it flips and that's where the surprise or draw is. For people that liked the first genre phase and for School Live that would be cute girls doing cute things at school or a slice of life this might be jarring and destruct their expectations. But for other people who find the main genre lacking or uninteresting the change up is the spice up.,5608,528,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Where to start?,5610,530,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I’m pretty excited about this anime. Never have I started an anime before there was at least 10 episodes and that was only once. Outside of that I wait till they are finished with at least the first season sometimes all seasons so I can just click next episode and watch the whole thing continuously. I was interested in this particular anime when I first saw it on the upcoming anime lists and was anticipating it. When I couldn’t think of anything else to watch today I decided to start this anime (even though I will probably end up restarting it as soon as the season is finished) and see if it was worth continuing to anticipate it or whether to stop looking forward to its completion and possibly not bother with the rest of it at all. Four episodes isn’t much to go on and certainly can’t determine if the anime will be good or bad overall but so far it’s lived up to my expectations and I’m really excited to see the rest of it. For now I have reviews for the first four episodes. Eventually I will update with an overall review when the season is finished.,5611,531,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Iria the Animation is set in an over the top science-fiction future. The main character is Iria a bounty hunter who gets caught up in a fairly epic battle with a seemingly indestructible monster named Zeiram.,5618,535,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Iria: Zeiram The Animation is a classic example of an old school anime.  Its one of those animes that just has that old memorable feeling to it ya know?  Well as the story goes its really a far fetched bogus one if you ask me.  The most powerful demon known as Zeiram escapes and its up to bounty-hunter Iria to stop this havoc.  That's as good as it gets in 6 ovas folks.  The monster is invincible and Iria has to find a way to kill it before it destroy Earth.  Its a pretty drawn out story that could of been made into about 2 ovas its incredibly slow and takes some will-power to finish it up.,5620,536,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime has some potential but it doesn't live up to it at all. The story doesn't start to get interesting until episode 9: I was seriously tempted to drop it because up to that point it's quite boring. Maybe they thought they were building up the characters in the first 8 episodes I've got no idea but if that was the intent I must say they failed. And when the story finally starts to kick in I had a repeated feeling of deja-vu. Apart from Steins;gate that is easily the first one that comes to mind the plot also made me think of Higurashi no naku koro ni kai and Kimi ga nozomu eien. So if you've already seen those 3 anime you can probably piece the plot together. But the problem isn't so much that the topic has already been dealt with in  other anime it's just that it fails to hit the target. The premises are there for a really dramatic story but in the end it isn't; it could have been a love-story but I get the feeling that the romance element was there just as an excuse for...what? So it's like there isn't a clear aim for any of it. One of the topics is time travel which is an extremely interesting and thought-provoking theme but they skillfully manage to turn it into something quite dull. Hell there's also something there at a certain point about the creation of artificial and intelligent life forms but the theme isn't explored nor are the consequences or implications analysed so it's just a ripple on the surface of a plot that continues to flow into nothingness.,5624,539,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I don't like perverted animes like this but I just wanted to try it out.It was really funny and in a way cute because he was so determined to learn.The chicks were really pretty or slutty if you prefer.I think they were both except for the girl who helps her family's business.The anime is old so it may look fuzzy at times.Overall it was pretty funny.,5647,551,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Have you ever thought to yourself  Hey I wanna watch a show about a somewhat satanic club that is potentially full of Nazis ? yea me neither.

"When ‘Desert Punk’ was first shown to me I was unsure about how I would feel about it. Surprisingly I was blown away. With the story set in a desert wasteland after what people believe to be mankind’s undoing people who live in this hellish environment must do what they can to survive. Take all rules and social boundaries you have today and throw them in the trash they mean nothing in this Hell known as The Great Kanto Desert. Bandits slave trading murder for a quick buck and a whole lot more of despicable behaviour all bundled into this action-comedy of an anime. With writing geared towards my demographic of rude selfish and perverted 20 year olds it spares no expense getting across the point that swearing children (and swearing at children) objectifying women and killing for money makes scum like me laugh.

First things first this anime shows the truth about human nature when pushed into situation similar to the desertpunk. The characters dont act in an angelic manner which is the case with most anime . In desertpunk all the characters have unique personalities .....It also shows the daily life of a handyman/bounty hunter and the situations he/she face during tasks . There is another part which I loved most desertpunk and his perverted nature lol.This is my first time writing about the anime I like hope I covered most of the anime aspects with this review without spoiling the story .,5674,568,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So a 10/10! Some might say that is ambitious. But the thing about this movie is that it is just that good! The story is just what you would expect to come from a trigun story. Nothing was overdone and none of the major characters was left out. The writers did a really good job even though there there has been such a big gap between the movie and the anime. This movie fufilled all the expectations i made since i heard that there would be a movie!,5686,575,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Trigun was a cute funny series with moments of darkness and profoundity.  Most of the latter is missing in this decidedly fluffy movie but it is very much in the spirit of the series and it is consistently entertaining and amusing.  However I wouldn't call it memorable or especially affecting.  It was pretty much a long episode of the series and if that appeals to you it won't disappoint.,5689,578,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you want to see some oldschool epic action anime this is for you. This anime have many emotions and it can teach you many things about life. That's why i love this anime. Of course everything has minuses so and this anime.There were some parts and facts i didn't like it but judging when this anime was made i just could say they made an amazing job.In my opinion the strongest part of this anime was characters and their different feelings.Every character was made different from inside and from outside.The story is was little bit floppy but i was kind a satisfied. About animation and sound i can't say nothing because it was made in 1990 and i don't want to compare to these days quality of animation and audio.I think they made really happy ending :) in my opinion they could have ended at 111 ep. but oh well. Overall if you are oldschool anime fan you should watch this.,5715,586,2019-04-13 21:35:40
After finally finishing this show it's time I give my two cents. I liked it. It turned out to be a rather told well and paced well in it's beginning with brilliant characterization and a well crafted protagonist in Yusuke Urameshi. It really showed that fighting anime CAN do well. It's english dub was very consistent and the dialogue matched well. However there were some flaws such as the love interest between Yusuke and Keiko which proved to be rather boring. I honestly don't know what Yusuke saw in Keiko. It seemed like she either was there to be a nag or keep Yusuke on a leash. Her english voice was one of the select few that got on my nerves. You could write her out and it wouldn't make a damn difference in the story. Then came the ending which I felt was so rushed and sloppy that it never really made me care. By the time I got to the Three Kings arc I was just waiting for it to end and when it did I was happy. This anime really could've been something more but chose to waste the majority of it's time on boring uncharismatic relationships and tedious repetitive fights (even though I liked the Dark Tournament arc for being complex) and the fact that we had a narrator (having one really killed the suspense).,5717,587,2019-04-13 21:35:40

She lives in an orphanage peacefully until some robbers come by and starts a fire. Nadja tries to run away and ends up with the Dandilion Travel Performers. On the way she finds new friends overcome obstacles and fine clues about her mom.

This is a great show to watch specially for Sci-Fi fans. It was created by Shuichi Shigeno who also created  Initial D . The story presents some really good ideas and is very similar to Ergo Proxy in the world theme and unfotunatley in the ending which is left open to interpretation. That is the only reason why I didn't rate this show higher as I really hate open endings. I feel they are just rude to an audience that has commited its time to watch the whole show to the end and then they are left with no closure. I often hear the excuse that the author wants you to think about it but that kind of translates to me as the author didn't really was able to think things through and come up with a good ending then evade the responsability by blaming it on the audience. This ending seems that was cut too quiclky as if the story really needed another chapter but there was no budget to make it.,5755,597,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This was an excellent mecha anime done entirely in 3D CGI. It had allhe trappings of the classic mecha genre: action romance politics andntrigue but the visuals made it a truly unique experience. The story revolvesround Kazuto a young mecha pilot with  AI  ability which is sort of sixth sense. He finds himself involved in a war between rival corporations forontrol of space. While I wouldn't want anime in general to move towards 3D CGIhis series was quite a refreshing detour from the usual.,5762,599,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you like little girls with guns shooting people without much of a story in it you might like this anime but I didn't like it much. The only part that could be seen as a story is the last three episodes the first ten are just for introducing the characters whisch is a bit long for my likings. The ending doesn't really seem like an ending either for they could just start with a next mission the next episode without a lot having changed for there is only one character less. My conclusion It's quite a boring anime without anything spectacular about it.,5764,601,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This show is...important.  It actually had something to say.  But the show itself is so minimalist that it never smacks you in the face with it.  So obviously there's a few interpretations on what that message is.  Find out for yourself what you'll take out of it.  ,5772,602,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really like Blood+. The story was in fact realy interesting but for me only at the end. The beginning was pretty boring. I kept on wanting some action.The animation was of course really good but i think they made Saya a bit too chubby and the colours at the beginning were a bit light for me. The sound was average no comments. I liked the charactern relationship built between them and how at the end you sorta just have to feel bad for Diva. Overall this was a pretty good anime to watch. I especially liked the romance. It was cute.,5838,627,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Welcome to my eleventh anime community review for Anime-Planet. This review I am taking on Blood+ an anime from Production I.G. As usual no spoilers and comments would be greatly appreciated I also like criticism and reviews of my review. It helps me know what to do different in future reviews. Thanks for reading check out my other reviews and onto the review.,5841,628,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a good anime buecause the story line of it is really good and has one main goal/idee for it instead of having 10-15 episodes going off into side storys like other animes do. I love most of the characters of this anime because they are awesome people. I like the sound of the anime because it is really good and some of the characters have really nice voices to them. Sometimes the music can drown out a few words form the characters other than that it doesn't do that ofter. The animation of this anime is really good constering what year it was made in. This anime also has amazing details in some places of it. ,5842,629,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Guys I'm gonna be honest here... I PERSONALLY didn't enjoy this show. The only reason I gave it a bunch of above average ratings was because I can see why they're good I simply didn't enjoy the show as a whole... so expect some bias.,5844,630,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The beginning is quite slow and hard to get into but if you stick with it you'll actually start to get sucked into the story as it quickly picks up. Before you know it the end will make you wish it hadn't come to it's conclusion.,5849,633,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I first ran into Blood+ when I was flipping through the channels one evening and happened to see the first episode on Adult Swim.  Somewhat interested in the fact that they had made a tv series from the movie that I had remembered seeing sometime back I decided to go ahead and watch the series on my own.  While the tv series wasn't the greatest thing I had ever seen it was still good enough to have keep me entertained for a couple of days.,5854,634,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was sorry when the last episode of Blood+ ended - and that's usually a sign that the anime is a good one one that is worth watching. I actually marathoned the last 15 - 20 episodes in only 2 nights; when I finished I had that unpleasant feeling of loss that you get when you know you're not going to see any longer some friends you have come to care about.,5859,635,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First I must say that this was my second anime I've watched that wasn't mainstream. From the very first episode the story was very intriguing. I thought they had a genuinely original idea that many people could wrap their mind around. There were a few episodes that were pretty slow but I believe the ending to the series makes up for it completely. If you're looking for an anime with a great story and good action I highly recommend this to everyone.,5862,636,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I just finished watching this anime and i have to say its been a great and interesting journey because i loved it from the first chapter on i couldn't stop watching it and thats very difficult to say for me because usually im very picky with my anime lol,5865,637,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story:(10/10) Saya is a school girl who can't remember her past and such. Then blood thirsty beasts known as Chiropterans bring her back into her forgotten past. Then Saya along with her loyal chevalier Haji go on a journey to rid the world of these monsters. That little summary is very in general. It goes much deeper than that but would take too long to write about. But lots of nice action decent amount of blood some romance some government screwing things up and much more just put this story into a level of epicness. Also I loved the chevalier system. There are two queens like always (Saya and her twin Diva) and each can make normal humans into ageless creatures just like themselves except much stronger. Diva has a line of cehvaliers backing her up while Saya only has one two at one point. Chevaliers jobs are to protect their queen their master 24/7 and this little chevalier system thing adds more depth to the story and is easy to understand. Twists and shocks throughout leave you at the edge of your seat even past the ending credits of the final episode.(because there is a short short short clip after the ending credits that show the real true ending that everybody wants to see.),5871,641,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Fore the sign of a good anime is one where when it ends I feel a sense ofoss knowing that the story of the characters you've come to care aboutas ended.  With Blood+ I feel this way and because of that I know itas something I enjoyed.  Strangely when it all began 50 episodes ago Ias very much a skeptic and initially I expected very little:,5876,646,2019-04-13 21:35:40

If you love vampires then Blood+ is surely one of the best anime around for new comers and lovers alike. The story begins by introducing our protagonist Saya Otonashi who seems to be your normal high school student with just one problem she has amnesiac resulting in forgotten memories of the past. Adopted by her beloved farther George Miyagusuku Saya lives a happy life alongside her adoptive elder brother Kai Miyagusuku somewhat of a baseball nut and adoptive younger brother Riku Miyagusuku. However this all to normal life is quickly brought crashing around her and she is attacked by a Chiropteran resulting in her learning that she is the own person capable of defeating these monsters with help of her special katana and chevalier Hagi. ,5878,648,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Made by the hit-factory Studio Pierrot the ones who bring us Fushigi Yuugi Naruto and Bleach Tokyo Ghoul didn't take too much time to became as popular as the others.

Really underwhelming. Was pretty disappointed,5907,659,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This was a really good anime. The overall story was good and the charters had actual personalities. It took me 3 tries to get through the first episode because it's a bit sad in a simithetic way.,5908,660,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Well where do I start? I'm gunna make this simple.,5909,661,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Learn from Parasyte! I dont need to underline the similarity between these 2. Same basic plot same problems. and so on. And still Parasyte is far superior to Tokyo Ghoul. Lets see why.,5914,662,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Tokyo Ghoul got a lot of hype and i wasn't sure if I should have watched it or not since every time something gets a lot of hype it turns out being pretty bad. But Tokyo Ghoul promised and it delivered. I can't say what I wish it had because I had never heard of it before so from what it had I was pleased. There is alot of blood and I mean ALOT of blood. The story was pretty good although I didnt care much about the story of the CCG Investigators so I do wish the story kinda forgot about those or atleast showed less but it covered that issue with the great story. The animation was pretty good it looked great and had some really good details. The sound was also really good especially the opening. I would sing to it everytime it started ^^. The characters were also really good I did end up enjoying each and every one of them. It also did a good job in making you either really like the characters or really hate them. But not the type of hate that you wish they hadnt made that character no no no its the type of hate where if he/she was a real life person you would consider them one of those asshole friends of yours wich you try to avoid. And I feel like each character got enough screen time although we didnt see much about some characters wich did dissapoint me it tried to focus on the most important ones and it worked.,5916,663,2019-04-13 21:35:40
deffinitely not an anime for the faint of heart very intense both psychologically and emotionally the best way to look at this is insanity is not evil insanity is caused by reasons of the person wether they conflict with others reasons or not it does not make it evil it makes it the drive to push forward in this anime it symbolises no matter what action might befall someone insanity or reasons are needed to push through that is not to say there are no  evil  characters within this anime as when you fight without reason even if you delve into insanity you fight selfishly with out emotions for others this is what i felt watching this anime as for the characters themselves the development of them was amazing and is by far the best character development ive seen but also delves into the minds and perspectives of multiple sides being  good  or  evil  didnt apply and with that this is my review on the end of tokyo ghoul the first season im looking forward to season two.. especially with that cliff hanger.,5917,664,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story sucked me in instantly. I was watching it straicht all episodes at once. Great!,5922,668,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Need to say: the first time I watched I dropped. I thought the first episode was a little bit disturbing. But I got curious and I decided to give it a chance. And I loved it so bad.,5923,669,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,5924,670,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Honestly this is a perfect anime. On its own it is magnificent. Beautiful animation and fight scenes (though the censorship is ridiculous). Amazing characters you will feel for. Wonderful and engaging story. All around perfect. The only issue is they messed up. The original source content (the manga) is bar none the best story I've ever experienced. The anime adaptation decided to pick and choose pieces they wanted in order to speed it along and get to the action and show off the main character Kaneki Ken. So again standing alone it is wonderful. But being compared to the original manga it is a let down. Still if you like the manga this is worth a watch so you can see the characters come to life. It's pretty badass. Oh and the OP is the best OP created.,5925,671,2019-04-13 21:35:40
having watched this anime out of the blue and without expectation i was pleasantly surprised by its quality. the art is great the story is one of the best re-imagining of Frankenstein i've had the pleasure to come across. Humans and their ghoul counterparts the notions of survival society and the meaning of life can make for a mess of a story but this anime has managed to navigate this and is an enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are by no means original : the shy reluctant hero the mentor the deadly beautiful girl and the not entirely bad guy are all here as in most anime but hey !!! The last truly original characters were written in the times of Shakespeare and Moliere so i will never be harsh with manga/animes characters that resemble characters from other shows.... all in all a modern anime of good quality cany wait to watch the story unfold to its conclusion,5926,672,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Tokyo Ghoul is a harsh anime not for the fainthearted or people who don't like blood. It is heavily psychological and dark as well due to its premise and content if you are not looking for a dark show this isn't for you. Also WARNING this review may contain a few spoilers.,5933,678,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Pretty good. Has a solid story and solid characters,5935,680,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First and foremost the anime was espectacular the soundtrack and intro/Ending were really well portrayed (except for the beginning but i loved it anyways). however the many flaws in this one is greater than it's achievements. but i'll start with it's story i like where they went with it. does it remin me of a particular other anime with the same concept? yes but it plays with it nicely so it's not a problem. the story progression has a nice pace....in the manga which pisses me off more than vegeta when finding out goku's power is over 9000. why would you edit so much plot in the anime that was in the manga. there's no point in doing so which brings me to the core of my anger with this. censorship i hate hate hate HAATE censorship especially when it's not even close to being graphic. there's so many things that were cut from the manga and into the anime that in my opinion is not the same i don't categorize them in the same story anymore. changing settings from one to the other stuff gets left out the dialogue is so much different portraying Kaneki like an useless character when in reality is a pretty damn good character. the story (trying not to spoil it) is so great and it could have been soo much greater if it wasn't for so much censorship and editing. and honestly i think it's ruined the animation so terribly. i really had high hopes for the anime and all i got was nothing but rage and dissapointments. i wouldn't recommend a buy it's not worth the buy i recommend the manga volumes since that's the only legitimate thing there is next to the horrors of it's animation.,5936,681,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"I've heard of Tokyo Ghoul through streaming sites and interested in the synopsis I decided to peek at a few episodes. It turned out to be an enjoyable thriller that left me interested for more. It starts off with a calm interaction between two characters that later leads to a spark of danger and realization. After an organ transplantation takes place in protagonist Kaneki; causing psychogenic opposition that nauseates him. ",5938,682,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Tokyo Ghoul is a very hard title for me to rate. At some moments I was just dying to see what would come next while a certain story arc in particular just felt silly and uneeded. I would say it's strong suit is it's phenomonal animation and choreography which was paced well with fitting sound effects and music. However the story's plot could be very convoluted at times and although it has some admirable characters the main character himself Ken Kaneki fell short of my expectations.,5940,683,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you really think about it the premise of story it is not original at all. It could be exactly same with vampires. The idea of ghouls is just attempt to make an illusion of unique and new idea. There is slight but significant difference. Ghouls eat just human flesh. They do not need their victim to be actually alive or fresh corpse. I am not an expert in biology but I think blood decays way faster than flesh. They could eat as well corpses of naturally deceased. It does not even add any gore - for example Hellsing is very violent and bloody. This is why argument that it is more violent than vampire animes does not hold. Like if that should be an aspect of quality in the first place. This show is heavily censored for whatever reason to make from seinen manga source a shounen anime adaptation. What they were thinking!?,5941,684,2019-04-13 21:35:40
is happiness while eating people as important as happiness from seeing people as an emtional connection to eachother and reality?,5943,685,2019-04-13 21:35:40

WHOA. I MEAN WHOA. ok so the first episode was really the only one i loved until the last one.  the first one had me thinking it would be a psychological thriller with kanecki battling against eating people and what it means to be a ghoul and things like that. it was somewhat about that but mostly it was just a cops vs ghouls story which i didn't love and honestly i felt like kanecki was one of the minor characters.  then the last episode happened and i want to vomit but i still was sitting there stunned at the power of what just happened.  talk about 0-60.  i guess it was effective keeping kanecki kind of docile and irrelevant for awhile for that ending.  it was nothing less than artistic how twisted.  Besides my overwhelming impressions of the ending i thought the voice cast was maybe the best i've ever heard. there were some seriously difficult moments to voice in this anime lots of pain and crying and emotion and when the voice actors botch those moments it ruins them. not so here! especially kanecki was so convincing it made me want to cry or throw up or both.  and the opening song that they played in the first and last episode was PERFECT. totally haunting and creepy and gave you chills at just the right moment.  The animation was very good in a few episodes particularly the first and last it definately wasn't boring to look at it!  i'm a bit terrified to watch any more because of how disturbing it was.  i just recently watched a few horror animes the first one being deadman wonderland and i thought that was gruesome! HA! you better have a strong stomach and mind for this one!  watching this i thought several times this is the most disturbing thing i've ever seen.  but i've got a thing for bleak art.  ,5953,688,2019-04-13 21:35:40

One of the anime hypes in 2014 was a show called  tokyo ghoul  a dark fantasy story set in japan. It's an anime that makes the watchers shout YES and fall off their chairs. My name is bilguun alix and today i'm going to review TOKYO GHOUL.,5958,692,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Masterpiece. Same level of quality you would see out of Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia,5959,693,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Coming from a horror-lovers point of view Tokyo Ghoul was absolutely amazing and I rewatched it quite a few times. The characters were unique and each had there own backstory. I know that the first episode of season 2 recently came out - yay! - but it was said to not follow the same storyline of the manga.. I was rather dissapointed in this because I felt that season 1 was lmost incomplete. All in all this is a very good anime if you like continuing it from the manga. ,5962,694,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is probably one of those animes that leave you on a cliffhanger on the edge of your bed and so on. It is very magical and very well made (in my opinion). It probably relates to most of us and how we probably didn't fit in somewhere or at times where we could never say no. This animie had brought me on the verge of tears (at some parts) so I would also say that it is quite a heart-touching story. It is also full of blood gore and family troubles. Or comunity. I honestly can't describe how much I loved this animie in particuliar. I recommed it to people who enjoy adventure being close to tears and a little bit of blood! :),5967,695,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Get ready to plunge into a gruesome world of ghouls. Our main character Kaeki-kun is just a everyday ordinary human well....he was untill his whole world is turned upside down in a tragic event. He finds himself battling within himself with something that isnt quite human or ghoul. He must find a equilibrum before he ends up deveroring his friends. Overall I give this anime a 6/10 due to the fact that its storyline is entrancing and well developed. I'd say that the characters need some fine tuning and the anime needs to slow its pace. But if you want to watch an gory anime filled with action and suspense this should satisfy you. If not there's always an option to feast on some flesh happy hunting. ,5968,696,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is such an intense and beautifully written anime. It's one of those killers so do watch out. Characters do die thus making it another one of those hard core truth films. It shows the result of bad choices and the power of overcoming bad habits or nature. The main character goes throgh quiet a phenominal journey. He experiences great pains but gains life long friends still. It has a sense of mystery. The characters have such interesting backgrounds and its easy to feel sorry for the  good  and  bad guys  of the anime alhtough it will make you question who is really good and who is really bad. There are characters you will hate and grow to love or atleast understand more. I love how this film is not random but has a story line and purpose. It is definitelly a watch through to the end. ,5973,697,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sorry for the shortness of this review. I am writing this months after finishing it. Frankly the continuation of this anime and the manga has somewhat disappointed me but I love this anime particularly the directing. The contrasts between the ghouls and humans are clearly shown through the directing especially during the episode where Kaneki fighting Amon (episode 8 I think). ,5987,702,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Kinda sucks,5990,703,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Yes seeriously lol a 10/10. I loved this anime. Its one of the first animes Ive ever watched and I found it fantastic. The story is awesome. The animation is dark and beautiful. The colors really pop being thats its mostly so dark. The sound is awesome you can really feel everything. The characters though are where this anime really shines. Ken and company are all really good. I will admit I have a anime crush on Toka lol anyway though all through out the anime Ken is learning how to cope with being a ghoul. Problem is he doesnt want to give up his human side. Seeing his struggle in his journey is really a beautiful thing although it gets a bit annoying at times. The payoff at the end is definately worth it. I cant wait to read the manga and buy this on blu ray when its released.,5992,704,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Note: This review covers both S1 and Root A.,5993,705,2019-04-13 21:35:40
What? Another wimpy teen who wont accept his powers? Man can I choose them or what. Anyway this is number 4 because the plot (at least in root A) is not the best. But the fights and powers are more than awesome. One thing that upsets me is the fact that the whole series is just 24 episodes. Leaving the mind to wonder what they're doing next in the anime plot line. There are a few plot holes here and there but it still a good anime,5994,706,2019-04-13 21:35:40
For this review. I might just be in a unique position unlike some who were watching the Tokyo Ghoul anime series I had never even had contact with the manga series. Even now. I do not think that will change even after seeing the Tokyo Ghoul anime series. It was pretty impressive as it stands. While I am sure the manga series of Tokyo Ghoul is great. When it comes to anime and manga spectrum. I fall under the category of feeling more taken by anime. To this day only a few manga series have ever caught my attention and mostly have never had an anime adaptation tie in. I guess that means (laughs) that I like to keep anime and manga separate. Due to that this is going to be an anime series review for Tokyo Ghoul from an anime viewer’s only perspective with regard to this series.,5996,707,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I heard a lot about it and started watching with high expectations but i was a bit disappointed by the character. As i can't stand whining males i had a completely cold relationship with the main character and even the strong female ones could not compensate it. There were really good actions so the action and the story was at the end the reason i was watching it. BUT at the end was the main reason everybody must watch it (for me) and i just can't wait for the next season I hope that will be that badass as the last episode was. ,5997,708,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I watched the first season the first anime I actually ever really watched and paid attention to. I was hooked for days. Loved It. A definate watch for thriller/horror/crazy anime lovers.,5998,709,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So first off this isn't an Anime. It's just plasticine. It's the quality of if not lower of a third grader's school animation project. It is just 4 minutes of zombies moaning and a bloke screaming. There were a few seconds of action but even the action scenes sucked. The characters were just as bad. There was just  man  and two zombies. Overall I would actually suggest giving this a watch but just for you to see how bad it is.,6000,710,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first episode is a summary of SM SM R and SM S the second episode is about Haruka and Michiru on a cruising. They fight one of the SuperS enemies and decide to leave this villains to the classical Sailor Team. (That's an explanation why the outer Sailor Team doesn't appear in this season.) In episode 3 Chibiusa uncovers one of her classmates as a monster and fights her with the Sailor Team in a vampire castle.,6007,711,2019-04-13 21:35:40

In an alternate society personal computers known as persocoms are manufactured in the shape of attractive young humans. Hideki Motosuwa an all around loathsome specimen of a human being is a ronin trying his best to get into university (Even though he's pretty stupid). One night walking home from somewhere or other (job or work? I was to busy rolling my eyes to notice) he stumbles across one of these expensive persocoms just lying in the trash (convenient much?). She's also naked but that's less convenience and more of a not so subtle plot device. Anyhoo once he turns her on he realizes that she has no memories no basic computing type skills she can't even talk (refund anyone). Thus begins the epic love affair between a boy and his robot.,6025,719,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Plot,6028,720,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Take a bit of science-fiction with a question so used that has become cliche can the robots feel like humans do? put it in a slice of life of the misadventures of a small town boy rejected from college who tries to survive the great city and put a bit of ecchi to make the public laugh and what you got?,6030,721,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Now this anime is endearingly painful in my opinion. No no it was charming but painful near the end because the concluding episodes switched an innocent storyline into heart clenching reality yet not reality.,6031,722,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Chobits was one of the first anime series I ever watched from beginning to end nonstop. At the time I was living with a girl and we watched it together and neither of us slept for the whole night we had the DVDs for. Needless to say we were both blown away at the time. Now years later after seeing it again and after having seen so many other great shows it still hasn't lost is charm and entertainment value.,6032,723,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story,6041,726,2019-04-13 21:35:40
To understand the score one has to realise this show is more or less made for me. I love how CLAMP works - taking a used concept updating it and giving it their own touch. I've loved or liked everything they've created except for XXXHolic and X/1999 which is their dumb goth shows. But on to more important things.,6045,727,2019-04-13 21:35:40

 ,6050,729,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Chobits is a classic romantic comedy. It's not bad but there are too many things I found annoying frustrating or simply too naive for me to give it a higher score. It's like the creators had in mind exactly where they wanted to get and what kind of message they wanted to pass  on and in the light of that  higher purpose  they willingly decided to sacrifice a bit too much of the viewers' patience and intelligence. ,6055,730,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The manga is WAY better yo. This anime just makes dude look like a pervert. if you really want to experience the world of Chobit's. Like I have said. Pick up the manga. It will do you some good to read any how. Haha. Juat pick up the manga. Nough Said.,6056,731,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There is a lot to like about the ambitious cyberpunk anime Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Based on the movie Ghost In The Shell this series fleshes out some of the characters seen in the film and adds a lot more.

Wallflower was a very funny anime and I loved Sunako's personalitymostly the part that she's chibi 24\7.Kyouhie was cute two.The animation is a little different than what I normally watch but it was still very elegant.The only problem had with this anime was there wasn't enough romance in my opinion.I meansure there was really romantic scenes but there wasn't any kissing and when I say kissing I mean not accidentalwillingly.Please correct me If I'm wrong.Remember to leave comments! ^ W ^,6115,761,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This has moved it's way up in my heart very quickly! I had never heard of it two days ago and now it's my #2 fav anime of all times ^.^ It's got everything I love in an anime; it's super funny got the reverse harem goin on and best of all it makes me go all warm and gooey with a wonderful ending that provides both closure as well as an opportunity to make a sequel. All in all if you liked Host club this will become one of your new favorites too I promise ^.6,6117,763,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Loved the preview clip for it so I bought it without hesitation. Now I wish I had checked more into it online. It's great for laughs the first time but doesn't warrant rewatching after that. The whole storyline is a bit shallow as well. If your wanting a good laugh but not much else then I would recommend it. I just prefer better character depth which this offers just about none.,6120,765,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The wallflower is the story of Nakahara how she is to live with 4 guys housed by her aunt the reason she is housed with them is she is worried about her well being and wants them to turn into a lady and they would get free rent. Nakahara is far off from a lady she loves everything scary and has a twisted humor she loves her manikins and skelletins she adores horror movies and she doesnt care about her looks and has a short horific temper that will scare the hell out of you aswell as her humor but overall she is a kind person she just has trouble expressing it with these very good looking men and when they are nice to her her nose bleeds. They become friends and become protective of her for she is reckless and can be delusional at times and they just want to keep her in a good mood but its a very funny anime not boring or too sappy.You just have to take it one episode at a time and enjoy the story and character developement and dont just focus on the crazy moments. I enjoyed the story and the animationthe characters are great I love noi and Nakahara and kyouhei spite his attitude I think he cares about everyone and Nakahara. I reccomend you watch it if your looking to have a good laugh I personaly loved it to watch it twice.,6122,766,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I really enjoyed this anime in all honesty. Sunako Nakahara is insecure self concise and very misguided but at the same time she is loyal to her friends and will risk her own happiness for them. Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge is quite enjoyable and it's interesting watching Kyohei Ranmura  Takenaga and Yuki trying to turn Sunako into a lady. Her crazy aunt adds flare to the show. I found Sunako to be a very empowering but also  overly emotional character within this anime and I just loved her unique portrayal as a 'creature of darkness'. It was also quite interesting to hear her reference others as creatures of light. I can't say that her nose bleeds when in the sight of said creatures of light really made sense but it was quite humerous.  One thing I can say that I disliked was the weirdo  goth goth lolli lolli  chanting girls because they were highly annoying and rather unnecessary. Sunako'' s obsession with gore creepy things and half rotted mannequins enhanced her creature of darkness vibe and the interactions between her and the four boys she is forced to stay with left me in utter hysterics especially when the four boys were afraid of her. The exaggeration on the boys looks and their apparent appeal is also quite amusing as the group gets caught up in various amounts of trouble. I really enjoyed this anime and I wouldn't be lying if I said it's one of my favourites.,6127,768,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is very funny but I felt that it was left unfinnished. The story line it's self was decent and the characters are well developed but none of them actually seems to grow or learn form their experiences very much and the overall problem of the story  becoming a lady  is never really solved in the anime. After watching this anime I felt like I was left in a completely ramdom place with every problem that the characters had left unsolved,6129,769,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is 25 episodes long the plot is introduced on the first episode which is to turn Sinako into a beautiful lady and then there are 23 and a half episodes of filler after the first episode. The story only has a couple of laughable moments but they did my biggest pet peeve and commented about how they were self aware that they were an anime. And while the anime is only 25 episodes long the same plot line (kidnapping) is used 4 times- that's unnessasary.,6149,775,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I love wallflower. The interactions between all of the characters are never dull. The only con of this show is the lips of the male characters. It is a bit disturbing because they really look like women. If your thinking about dropping the show don't. I have no idea if I blocked it out because the story was so good or the animators might have fixed it part way through the series. Love the show.,6151,777,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,6152,778,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I loved this anime! The storyline is hilarious as are the characters. The way Sunako goes from regular animation to blunt chibi is very entertaining as is the way the boys sparkle. The exageration of everything makes this very entertaining. Because Sunako is so much not a lady and must be transformed into a lady the series is that much funnier. Great anime I loved it!,6153,779,2019-04-13 21:35:40
There is really not that much to say about Chi's Sweet Home: Atarashii Ouchi other than that it's heartwarming and innocent. This is an anime good for any age and purrfect for any cat lover. All of the characters are entertaining in their own unique way. It's wonderful how they showcase distinct cat breeds like the Scottish Fold Alice. If you're looking for something extremely cute to pass the time this is for you with each episode being less than 3 minutes a piece. The animation isn't spectular but it's bright and colorful when it needs to be. The opening song is catchy and the music matches the sweet playful kitties.,6154,780,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Chi is just the cutest animé character ever! After seeing chi's sweet home I got curious about Chi's New Address (Chi's Sweet Home: Atarashii Ouchi). I've watched all 104 episodes in 2.5 days and loved it. The family finally a keep Chi in their new appartment. I laughed when Chi ran back to their old house and the new owner came in. And I loved it every time Tama came to get Chi out of trouble. Fuji also is a hilarious cat in this series. One of the final episodes actually made me cry. I've seen both series and the OVA and I can only say: Chi is the cutest animé ever!!!,6162,782,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Me!Me!Me! is a very graphic and brutual depiction of what I think is an otaku's relationship with his waifu going sour.

I was suprised this had such a low overall rating. I thought it was awesome for a one shot OVA. This was one of the best examples of a shoujo/shonen mix. I wish I could see more or read the manga. CAT is a organization made up of beautiful women whom are highly skilled at their trade of anti-terrorism. Their leader is  Rosemary  Rosebanks. Who hates terrorist after losing her husband and son to a terrorist attack. They are sent out to a mission in Switzerland. There are mostly elements of shoujo with the artstyle and the leading ladies but the shonen elements are well played. Great action scenes. We don't get to know the characters other than Rosemary but we get quick glimpses of some of their personalities. I loved the animation. Shoujo style but laden with action. The story is very simple. The sound was satisfactory.,6205,804,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Okay I know what you're thinking? Why would I give it anything above a 1? I'll tell you why... I liked it. It falls short of the series by all means but it was overall good. It actually had a story where it mirrors the Queen's Blade except it's called the Queen's Bra. The girls must pull off tops and the winner is the queen. Well I guess I liked it because each episode felt connected to on another and easy to keep up with. Of course being the specials you get an overwhelming amount of fanservice (which does not bother me). I must admit though I'm just as surprised as you are about this rating.,6229,815,2019-04-13 21:35:40

To be honest I'm not sure if is even deserves 5/10 as a whole this series is very boring repetitive and becomes a task just to watch it. The first 14 episodes were amazing story wise characters in it seem a bit pointless as they only show up for one maybe two episodes unless your Kirito or asuna even though they try to involve all the characters is af there vital to the plot. The second half of the first series was awful it lost all point to it and ended up being a clone of the first series with some more pointless characters and poor story development. The second series with GGO wasn't terrible but didn't understand the point of the sex change and the whole use of swords in it. The second half of the second series is the worst though with a boring story more terrible characters and then they just kill a main character in a attempt to make you feel sorry they actually spent more time changing the opening sequence then developing any form of story and this series as a whole is going to end up just like how attack on Titan being a franchise which is just going to keep being milked and broken up with fillers. As I see it the only way to revive this is if they make an alternate ending to the first 14 episodes or redo the first 14ep but drag it out a little so you actually see the rest of the characters and maybe some fight scenes would be nice. The only good thing about this series was the first 14ep story and the fact that the voice acting wasn't terrible which is quite surprising considering how most series do (Akame ga kill in particular) despite everything the new series might be worth a watch but as I see it the series is already ruined.,6246,821,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm currently at episode 9 and I can say that I like the animation style the music and sounds along with the character designs. However I feel the story lacks a real feeling of flow and the characters feel unrelatable. It's not boring - the story premise is great - but for me it does not do a whole lot. I'm hoping it gets better but I'm truly only continuing with this anime in order to talk about it to my anime loving friends. If they had not though it was amazing I certainly would have dropped it by now. ,6251,822,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Really didn't like SAO and I am sure alot of people agree with me but there are many diehard fanboys so I will give my reason. PACING. The pacing on this anime drove me batshit crazy 1 episode nothing would happen the next they clear like 30 levels it just made no sense. The relationship of the main characters should of been expanded on as I felt there was little development and more backstory should of been added. The fight seens were OK typical shounen but nothing like an MMORPG however I don't think they were trying to. If you want to watch a real game anime just watch Log Horizon its a masterpeice.,6267,826,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I watched the first episode of SAO and was like omg I must watch more! I fell in love with the characters the plot the animation the music…basically everything! As the series went on I was a little disappointed because it changed focus to the love between two characters which only disappointed me because it started out so epic I wanted it to be that way forever. Still I understood the need for the break for the sake of character sanity was my guess because let's face it being trapped in a game where if you die your body in the real world died too would cause some major anxiety and stress disorders unless every once in a while you sat back and relaxed.. Keeping that in mind I was able to work through my disappointment and continue the series which was good because it is amazing and it does go back to the epic fight scenes where everyone might die and some do. The first half is better than the second I shall warn you now. But it was overall worth the time I put into it. I loved the characters when people died I wanted to cry when they had a happy ending I gave them a small shout of victory. The story seemed a bit rushed at parts and a bit slow at others so I guess it balances out okay. It had a lot of hype and I know most people either love it or hate it. It's not really one that falls in the in-between for anyone. Overall I consider it worth the watch.,6318,849,2019-04-13 21:35:40

It's an amazing anime. Personally I like the fact that it's fast paced but I was also surprised at first. The storyline is pretty good at the beginning but then became a bit bpring during ALO. I loved the fact that they put romance and action together and after SAO ended it seemed like a forbidden romance between Kirito and Asuna. The anime was pretty awesome. Other than the fact that after the 13 or 14th episode it started to become ALO which had nothing to do with most of the beginning and it sorta ruined how the SAO built up it was overall pretty good. They animations were really clear and it seemed like they were actually in a video game but also in the real world. The music was the really good! It matched the scenes perfectly. For me this is one of my favourite animes and I think everyone (who likes the genre) should watch it. FYI some parts of it may be a bit confusing for some people but I found it easy to understand lol.,6344,858,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Sword Art Online... You know at one point I was actually excited about watching this show but as the show went on and its problems became more and more apparent I grew a burning hatred for everything about it that it began to define me at one point. Word of advice: Just because something is popular does NOT mean it's good (Just look at Justin Bieber Twilight and Call of Duty) as you will learn the hard way with this.,6368,865,2019-04-13 21:35:40
When going into this anime I had a few expectations mostly just because of what I was told from other anime fans that have similar taste in anime that I do. I was slightly let down but I didn't let it stop me from watching this first season to its fullest. Okay where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the first half of this season. The story was great the characters were easily connectable to me and the art is beautiful! Its the second half of this season that I couldn't seem to wrap my head around. It was slow the story was still okay but I liked the story from the first half more-so. All in all its a good one to watch if you have the time and your a fan of these kinds of shows to begin with (ie gaming etc) and I did enjoy it overall.,6372,866,2019-04-13 21:35:40

A pretty great anime for starters i nthe anime community. But the down side to this one is it gets worse as it goes so its not the best for super long terms. I personally love sao but in the order from Sao Alo Ggo and then Alo again it gets pretty side tracked and doesnt follow the story we all expected to get from the first part. My personal favorites parts is SAo Ggo alo the secound time and then alo the first. I feel like alot of fans agree with not likeing alo an ggo and we all want some sort of sao remake.,6381,872,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hate on it all you want Sword Art Online was a great anime. If it was just the Aincrad Arc (Episodes 1-14) this would have been easily a 9/10 potentially a 10/10. The Aincrad Arc was filled with suspence especially due to the fact that if someone dies in the game someone dies in real life. Although being trapped in a virtual world isn't the most original of ideas in my opinion Sword Art Online conveyed this perfectly. I tried watching Log Horizon and Accel World I couldn't even finish them but with Sword Art Online I'm very willing to rewatch it many times. ,6385,875,2019-04-13 21:35:40

**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** Ah Sword Art Online. One of the most argued over anime of recent years. Some say SAO is the messiah of anime and any who oppose it should be exucuted publicly. Others say watching Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman ten times would be more enjoyable than SAO. Though personally I believe both sides are completely wrong. Now why am I only now reviewing it?

It's awesome  but there's more holes in the first half of season 1 than swiss cheese.

Minor spoilers: I'm gonna be considered the bad guy here as this review is a negative one on reasons why i don't like it it was a great anime in terms of Characters and animation but if you run out of ideas to continue the story that half way through the anime you literally RESTART the entire fucking anime concept it ruins it for me i just watched it once i dont want to watch the exact same fucking thing again in the same season thats why i disliked this anime it started off we are stuck in this video game world which was kool then after they got out they fucking repeated the same god damn thing for one of the main characters being stuck in another game and the other main character is repeating what he did in an attempt to get her out and personally i dont like that i dont want to watch a repeat of the same anime in the same god damn season,6489,910,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The anime that started it all for me. Just simply put its a masterpiece. Everything is just so well done. The characters are what make this anime shine. Im admitingly a fan of Kirito x Asuna lol I thought their relationship really progressed well. Kirito is a bit OP (Overpowered) but theres a reason for that I think. This anime follows the light novels to a T. Which isnt bad. I liked the fairy dance arc pretty well just not as much. The best thing it did to me was introduce lefya who is becoming one of my favorite characters. The whole concept is awsome with the VRMMOs it really make you think how far are we away from diving in in real life. Overall awesome cant miss anime!!,6491,911,2019-04-13 21:35:40

There is a lot of discussions on the quality of SAO a lot of people say its  over hyped  or the second part of this show wasn't on par with the first. I for one really enjoyed this show from beginning to end I didn't for a moment feel like the show dipped in quality for any reason. I was really invested in the characters and the show made me care for them! There was amazing action and Kirito'S (mc) will power to protect the girl he loves was awe inspiring.

I was really hesitant to watch Sword Art Online at first to be honest the rather polarized nature of the pro and con viewer bases tends to make the show more of a minefield to traverse than a sit back relax and enjoy experience.  Initially I was one who watched the first episode and dropped the show in favor of another show I had in queue for viewing I made the mistake of not giving a show enough time to full lay out the story it wants to tell before rushing to judgment and in some ways I am glad that I reversed that decision and gave SAO a chance.  Now those platitudes aside is the show good?  Yes.  Is it as good as the hype that surrounds it?  Let's have that discussion.,6524,926,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I watched this show because my bestfriend insisted on it. The first few episodes I liked I thought it was an intresting concept and wanted to see the ideas explored more. However I was subjected to side stories that made little sense to the main plot. The story fell falt with the time jumps that could have been used to have more cool fight scenes and furthur the story. The charaters where a bit bland honestly. They felt two dimensional and underdeveloped. Kirito felt like a Gary Stu who could overcome whatever was thrown at him espcially near death. ,6528,929,2019-04-13 21:35:40

When I Seen the First Episode I got hooked and i couldn't stop Thinking about it. I admit im a writer and it makes me think how could i make this a fan fin too. Over all I LOVED it. Right now im trying to get the DVD's for it because i just couldn't stop watching it. The Story line was great and I say it had some great twists in it that did not see in it.,6547,934,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,6548,935,2019-04-13 21:35:40
First off let me say..I do not believe this is worth the hype. Do not get me wrong..it is a good/decent anime. I just think this anime should have ended at episode 14. The first arc is really good and loved most of the characters action and the plot as it went on. It something really different and I would have easily said it would have been one of my favorites. The 2nd Arc after episode 14 is just what spoils it all for me.,6553,936,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This anime is one of the best i have watched virtual reality is something i can't wait for if it ever happens it can open up so many great things if we perfect it as in ways to see and meet up from family around the world and go have fun! ,6554,937,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I've got to say i was very dissapointed in the how this show turned out. While the animation is amazing the sound editing is spectacular the charachters for the most part are brilliant the story fail in a major way. It should have ended at episode 14. Great show great twist amazing plot development and characters. up untill that point i was fully enjoying myself if not a little bit confused when the show was over but i still had 12 episodes to watch. well okay then is this season 2? what is happening here. well no this is not season two this is a continuation of the same season. however we get introduced to new characters a very odd love square a new villan a new plot that is even less realistic then a game creator who traps all of his players in is virtual world which by the way never does get explained why but i was okay with that the new villans reason is just creepy and gross and totally changes the entire feel and emotion of the show. really it seemed like episodes 1-14 was a great great show then from 15-25 someeles hijacked the characters wrote the own bad abd preverse fanfic around what they thought would make a better story and failed miserbly.

Episodes 1-14 were pretty amazing;5/5. Episodes 15-25 were absolutely aweful. They consisted of really cliche and super creepy aspects; 2/5 for the second part. Overall I highly recommend the first part of SAO but I wouldn't touch the second part of season one.,6560,941,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I thought this anime was good not great. I was terribly bored for the first half the story didn't seem to be going anywhere every episode had the cadence of filler! After that great first episode I really thought there was going to be some serious story going but all we got was a bit of romance that for me came out of almost nowhere. Asuna was only in a few episodes and she just was inserted into the story without any kind of  hey it's that girl again...  from kiritoor something like that they were just shown together planning an attack or something from the beginning of the episode out of nowhere.  I didn't feel their romance was developed hardly at all so I was pretty freaked out when they confessed their undying love for each other in the canyon and then were awkwardly trying to sleep together and then kirito pops the question and just... what? And then all of a sudden it's a rustic love story in a cabin by the lake.  I also thought it was pretty lame when all of a sudden they got out of the game.  After all this there really wasn't a final boss battle in my mind and all my wondering about why someone would do this and there didn't seem to be a reason at all.  I know the story goes on but I was expecting more build up to that kind of a moment and more delivery when it finally came.  The moment when asuna and kirito said goodbye was the first time I felt the emotion.  When Kirito recited asuna's true name I started to feel as if these were two real people in love and how sad it was that they were about to lose each other perhaps because it seemed to hit kirito at this moment too- how much he didn't want to lose her as a lover but more than that as a companion who had been by his side in this crazy game.  I also started to like the love story once I saw kirito crying in his room no longer a dramatic corny fantasy romance where the two get married after 4 encounters but a kid in love with a broken heart terrified to lose someone.  Consequently I enjoyed the search and how he only came alive in the moments he was close to finding her. I also enjoyed the story between sagu and kirito though it was a bit strange if I were to explain it to someone.  There were moments between them where I felt what they really had said to each other even if they hadn't said a word like when sagu cried to him in her doorway and he looked away I knew he was saying he didn't love her and she knew it too. It was a nice ending too the way she said she couldn't reach him where he was and in the end when he pulled her along anyway I knew she was happy because they would be able to stay together in this world.  Besides the story I thought the soundtrack had merit and the voiceovers were powerful at times very impressive.  When Asuna was crying into Kirito's arms saying she wanted to stay with him forever the emotion in her voice made it heartbreaking.  The same as when Kirito was apologizing to her for not sending her back to the world whimpering and clutching her so tightly because he didn't want to lose her.   The same as when he was crying to Sugu because he was about to lose her all over again.  There was also some animation that surprised me.  When sugu fought Kirito when yui was running in the corridor to find asuna with kirito and some of the fight scenes with kirito.  One of my favorite filler episodes was with sachi somehow it felt significant.  I also liked the idea of keeping one's heart in store.  The parts with asuna basically being raped were a bit much.  Overall I liked it but I wasn't super into it. I would probably watch it again but maybe skip a lot. ,6567,943,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I'd heard a lot of people talking about this anime and how they liked it so i decided to give it a try. I really enjoyed watching it and seeing Asuna and Kirito grow closer and found it sweet when Yui came in but....i felt less satisfied with how it came to be when in got into the storyline of Alfheim (is that what it was called?) the realtionship between his cousin was okay at first but the way they ended it made it seem like he didn't care for Asuna as much as he did at first. well that's just what i interpertated from the ending not what others may feel from it. It was still a good anime in the end though.,6572,946,2019-04-13 21:35:40
If you are interested in watching Sowrd Art Online I suggest you do. This was the first anime I ever watched and I am so glad many people convinced me to give this a try. Ever since watching this I have gained a love for anime. Now back to SAO. So the story has some plot twists in the middle of the season which are interesting. The initial story is what got me excited but the goal of the main character changes throught this first season so if you really don't like it when the main character changes a lot then this is not for you. Other than that I really liked the concept of someone stuck in virtual reality and having to reach the end of the game. So if you like that then it is also good. But one thing is I stopped watching after this season because I hated the ending and transition to the next season. I tried giving the second season a try but I got bored and stopped but the first season is definitely worth watching. ,6573,947,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The story is good in the first season the second season is only for people who want more of this mmo-life type anime but the story is actually worse in the second season.,6591,957,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sword art online had me at the phase  You die in the game you die in real life.   The story Stay alive in the gamelevel up and beat the game 100 floors. Animation in this show is beautiful to the fight scenes or just walking around in SAO. Sound. I like the sound in this show to where fighting starts to where it's sad. The openings to sword art online I love it alot. It get stuck in your head. The characters. The main character in the show is Kirito and asuna in the first half and in the second half you got Kirito and Suguha. Kirito is over powered and asuna I also think is over powered as well. The one part I have a problem with this is that you get side characters like Lizbeth&Silca I want to know more about them but you take what you get. Overall 9/10 This is my first anime review I ever done so I hope done ever thing right. I hope you enjoy my review.,6593,958,2019-04-13 21:35:40
DEFINITELY MY FAVE COUPLE EVER!! I hope they put more romance though (I know some of you might think it will be too much but seriously they are so cute LOL). I deeply in love with the first season but unfortunately the second season isn't really my type (sorry).,6594,959,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Three words to sum up 3.0: Confusing. As. Hell. ,6675,988,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"I'll tell you straight up that I enjoyed this movie. Would it have been more enjoyable if it hadn't been thirty-five seconds of actual plot surronded by an hour and a half of wierd pseudo-symbolic light shows? Probably. Would it have been more enjoyable if there had been just one iota of continuity? Probably. Would it have been more enjoyable of the characters acted like sane human beings someone actually explained something (anything really) or if the movie could go five minutes without introducing something new and bizarre while acting like we should totally know what it is? Probably. But then again if it didn't have all that then it wouln't really be Evangelion would it? Don't get me wrong if the fourth movie was just a fifteen minute plot wrap-up followed by three hours of explaining what happened in the previous movies I would be thrilled. But part of the alure of the franchise is the mystery of it all: we all have questions about Evangelion and I for onw think that konwing the answers wouldn't make me any happier. Questions like  Just what were they smoking when they made this movie? ",6676,989,2019-04-13 21:35:40

For the Existing fans some may now HS:DXD sloped a little in story on Season 2 after what was really nice in Season 1 but with the bringing of Season 3 theres no other way to describe this than it goes absolutely  Balls Deep .,6686,994,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The majority of the story was pretty decent and it was nice to see how the animators incoporated most of the elements of the manga into the anime. However the ending of this season of Highschool DXD left little to be desired and left a bad taste in my mouth. This is especially true when considering that they created an all new plot to end this particular season. All in all this would have gotten a 9/10 if they would have stayed a bit more truer to the manga this season but in this day and age that seems a bit to much to ask. Although entertaining the ending caused this to be a huge let down.,6687,995,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm not even going to bother tying to rate this at the moment.  What I will say is that DXD series wise is by far my favorite anime.  That said...,6688,996,2019-04-13 21:35:40
they show u so much characters in the beginning of the anime and it all starts so good but then u get like wow they could do some awesome fights with the chaos begrade but no they dont do it all the charcters are just some side guys. they just fill the last 5 episodes with some random shit so dissapointed season 1 & 2 were so good and they failed born so hard wont watch highschool dxd anymore. ,6689,997,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I'm a big fan of series but this season make me really disappointed. They had a lot of material in this arc even with some minor and mayor changes they could make good seasoned. Instead they mess up everything. Story don't make sense at all. They droop some very important events just to make story go faster so they could put in some of they story which destroy original story. Compared to original story it soooo dumb and flat. They even jumped forward and make Ise use cannon... I only hope that next season will not be as disappointing as this one.,6690,998,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Story (9/10):This was an excellent OVA but is often underrated because many people lack an understanding of what was actually happening. The story is based on a young school girl named Mato. Eventually in the show she meets a girl named Yomi. In the first good portion of the OVA they grow very close to each other and this friendship grows very greatly as it goes on. This portion of the show takes place around an entire school year.,6693,1,2019-04-13 21:35:40
I was unsure what to expect from Black Rock Shooter as i havent been interested in 1x50mins animes as i fail to see how they can have anything much of a story. Now by no means i will say its the best or worst of anything.

There are two ways to look at this anime. Together in addition with the original Shiki series or alone. Does it matter which way you choose? Not really since this series is the spitting image of all that ever held the title of pure awesome.,6768,35,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Two brilliant additions to the story (which are already included before the final episode on DVD). One follows Hasegawa as he witnesses how evil the villagers can be when they ruthlessly slaughter the underground Shiki they once knew as neighbours and the other follows wife and mother of 2 children Motoko Maeda as her mental state begins to deteriorate the longer the  epidemic  goes on. One will have you crying your eyes out for both Hasegawa and Nao and the other will give you goosebumps and possibly scar you for life...,6769,36,2019-04-13 21:35:40
These were a wonderful edition to an already amazing series. When I watched them they were actually placed into my series as episodes 20.5 and 21.5. They center around characters we have seen and know maybe a little about (Nao in particular) and they give a little background into what is happening to them during the vicious final episodes. We start with Nao's story. This first episode is edge of your seat intense and completely ruthless. I absolutely loved it. I was so involved with Nao and what was happening to her all the while learning about a few other characters and realizing the extremes people go to. That ending was just....wow. Man this one was so very good.,6771,37,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Sianeka Super Short Review: This frenetic fast-paced music video features quick cuts from scene to scene depicting TV's pervasiveness in everyone's lives.  Bright color varied animation styles flash cuts and jumps from scene to scene the graphics pop in time with the music. Everything happening everywhere is captured on a TV screen somewhere and everyone's life plays out on the tube to the accompaniment of sponsored ads and color commentary by news anchors.  Scenes from everyday life scenes from extraordinary happenings regular people superheroes and even aliens: all caught on the boob tube.  As we watch a situation happen in real life a scenario from another area is being shown on the TV screen.  Cutting to THAT scene we see yet a different TV episode being played out in real life. All events both those in the background and those in the foreground are shown on someone's television somewhere.  Everyone everywhere doing anything at all is a TV star. All of life is a TV show.,6772,38,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Everything about this show i enjoyed. sure there were a few plot holes here and there but i was willing to forgive them by the amazing cast.

A cool action based story with plenty of twisted characters to please the pallet. The only thing that kept this one from being a 10/10 in my book was the fact that the ending seemed incomplete. Obviously leaving room for a sequel (if you watch past the credits).,6802,54,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Chi's sweet home adapted from the manga of the same name is an atypic anime. It comes in a atypic presentation of 104 episodes of less than 3 minutes each. So everything runs fast. It is also difficult to review.,6830,62,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Spend an entire night to watch through unlike others I didn't look at anything beyond a brief summary of the anime. It caught my eye and I decided to watch it through. Got about half way through and was hoping for some plot progression but never got any. This anime is a deadend while the characters are interesting and the premise is a good idea. It was not well executed and the ending is abyssmal. If you thought death note had a bad ending after season 2 you are in for a shock if you watch through the whole thing.,6832,64,2019-04-13 21:35:40
well if you have seem my other review which  i know you havent since i only have one and plus this one it should be two but anyways just so u know i only like judging by 1-5 5 being the highest but since this dont let me judge it by 5 hey what else can i put so as i was saying this show was really good for a anime that based its hole story using logic if you want to know what this a anime is about then let me tell you right know,6833,65,2019-04-13 21:35:40
So much lost potential. Let me start with a little comparison. This anime is the most similar ever made to Death Note. The characters the storylines everything. Its not a clone but its pretty damn close. 2 things can happen: 1. its just a third grade copy of the Big Brother 2. its actually memorable and a worthwhile watch.  This is actually clsoer to the second choice. I watched it something like 10 years ago when it aired on TV and now when a re-watched it it turned out that I remember basically all the sotrylines and plottwists so it undoubtedly memorable. ,6834,66,2019-04-13 21:35:40

I was very optimistic about this anime to begin with. The premise is interesting but once I got past the 4th episode I could see that the plot was going in a direction that was ultimately leading nowhere. I watch until episode 8 but I really just couldn't ever get myself in the mood to watch it again after that. The shame is I really liked the characters. And a warning for anyone who plans on watching it...I've seen spoilers...and the anime series ends without anything being resolved. If Spiral interests you perhaps you should read the manga rather than watch the anime?,6837,69,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Suzuka is an anime plotline that would feel right at home in a soap opera. The main theme is romance despite how sport oriented it appears. And this anime is a painful reminder of what makes the majority of anime bad. A predictably terrible plot ripped to shreds by absymal characters. The main character is another who'd define the very term of 'Tsundere.' I am so glad that its over. And now I'll tell you why.,6848,79,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a slow moving anime. I agree but somehow it's so slow that you will be caught between dumping it and watching it by dragging(just to see the end of it).  The whole story would actually fit in 9 episodes. Imagine it got dragged to 26. Just dragged.,6849,80,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This actually was a really good anime.  I really liked the Story behind it and I really want more.  To me the only problem with the anime is quite literally the sound.  The voices are obscenely quiet and it doesn't help that the rest of the sound is normal volume.  Perhaps the version I watched was just not the best quality when it came to sound but if they are all like that then this rating stands.  Otherwise I can't really think more on story or character development only that I think it could have used something more.,6851,82,2019-04-13 21:35:40

The idea for this is kind of cool and it was fun seeing how well the story/characters from the anime fit into a school setting. And I loved the Naruhina moments! But... There was also a lot of implied yaoi and I hate that kind of stuff so... It was hard to really enjoy this special with as much yaoi as there was in it. Plus I felt like the short kind of just ended. It didn't seem to fit the opening scene. But it's not the worst thing I've ever seen either.,6867,90,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi,6883,98,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Story - The story was okay. Not bad but not real good. Another harem but more serious then most meaning it didn't have a bunch of girls chasing after one guy so it felt fresh. It took awhile for each girls to develop feelings for our male protaganist. I was happy with the pace the show went at. I would like a second season even though it has ended. But I would like to see a little more of just the characters hanging out. So it was just an okay story. Worth the watch if you want a more realistic harem. I don't usually root for the girl that was picked in the end but I thought she was the best choice overall.,6884,99,2019-04-13 21:35:40
The first thing I have to mention about Hoshizora e Kakaru Hash is the simply stunning animation and artwork. The first thing the audience sees is running water and dam is well animated but that’s just the beginning. The way the trees seem like they have individual leaves swaying in the wind and the birds flying in the ground sky brings the whole atmosphere surroundings and story to life with a sense of awe.,6885,100,2019-04-13 21:35:40
"This anime was fun to watch. Like all Japanese anime it seemed a little rushed at the end. I don't know if they were losing ratings or what but the story overall was good.  This is a slice of life school boy harem comedy/ romance. It was easy to follow and they pretty much introduced the women one at a time and ended at the end of the episode if the girl was a match for the main character. I am not sure the purpose for the little brother. It seemed as if they must have had a bigger story in mind and then ran out of time money or just changed direction of the story structure. Overall it was a good story loved the ending. ",6889,101,2019-04-13 21:35:40

First thing I'd say is that there's little point in watching this movie if you haven't watched the series before. And even after having watched the series I'm quite conflicted about it. In my opinion it's a bit of a let down. But there are plenty of other reviews glorifying it so I guess it's a matter of personal taste.,6895,106,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Adolescence of Utena has an interesting history behind it. Based on the 1997 classic anime series Revolutionary Girl Utena Adolescence of Utena was an attempt by series director Kunihiko Ikuhara to re-vise the original series with less of the narrative restraints that were placed on him during production of the original series this time condensing the story into a one and a half hour long movie as opposed to a series work. Despite believing that Utena would be his final project after his previous work with the Sailor Moon franchise Ikuhara set out to re-tell the story in a different narrative style with a higher animation budget and almost no narrative restraints and the result was this movie; Adolescence of Utena.  ,6896,107,2019-04-13 21:35:40

"Yu Gi Oh GX is one of the top yu gi oh franchises that I just enjoyed the most. The animation in the show may have not been top notch but it was mediocre enough to get by. The one thing I wish that happened was that it got finished in the English dubbed.  The dubbed should have been better than the original Japanese cast but 4Kids had to screw it up and give the characters terrible VA's. The lines were terrible and the timing was off by quite a bit. Although when I watched the subbed version I enjoyed the whole thing. The story was great and the characters were also great themselves. Just remember one thing about 4Kids NEVER EVER WATCH THEIR ANIME VERSIONS THEY SUCK MONKEY BALLS! As what Elf would say  Damn you 4Kids you got me in the leg again with another crappy anime!

Nodame Cantabile: Paris is the second season of an 11 episode Josei (female equivalent of seinen) comedy anime with some romance about adults in classical music. When I first saw a clip of the first season I wasn’t very interested. Then due to my laptop dying I had few options for anime so I started watching Nodame Cantabile. Boy was I glad to be wrong that anime cheered me up and was both funny and interesting even if I had no interest in classical music. This is one anime that folks beyond the scope of the intended demographic may enjoy. This sequel moves on the story to the next phase in the lives of Chiaki and Nodame where they are in Paris as the title suggests. I never got a chance to review the original series since my laptop died but I remember wanting to do so.,6920,119,2019-04-13 21:35:40
This is a wonderful sequel. We get to see Nodame and some other minor charaters mature with their instruments. Also Nodame and Chiaki's relationship futher progresses. There is a lot more romance in this one. Nodame is still hilarious with  Gyabon . Also the music is wonderful. I never had a thing for classical music but ever since this anime I really LOVE it. Definately recommend finishing this series out.,6922,120,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Had no real expectations going in when I started watching this anime however within the first few episodes I began to love it although it may not be the most unique concept ever it was defiantly a change from what I normally watch and was exactly what I was looking for - A funny anime which a alright story line with fun/unique characters. Really enjoy this anime and to all the people hesitant on whether to watch this or not I would defiantly recommend if the kind of anime you're looking for the fun-comedy type. (Does have other genres to it however the comedy of it appealed to me more then the rest),6941,127,2019-04-13 21:35:40
A while ago I was watching a  Top 10 ___ Anime  video to find something to watch.  This certain video focused on Comedies and Baka to Test was #3 on the list.  The concept revolves on the idea that one's school grades determines the quality of their school equipment and are split up into classes based on them.  The higher the grades the better the stuff.  Classes go to war with each other using Summoned Avatars whose powers are also determined by their grades in order to take the losers' equipment.,6942,128,2019-04-13 21:35:40

So I had started this series on Netflix when it was first released and got board by episodes 5-7 (the Misao stoy line).  Recently I went back and watched it but skipped the second story line. So much better! Fell in love with the whole cast and loved the story lines! So for those who started this series and got bogged down by the second line (episodes 5-7) just power though the 3 episodes or skip it cause this is a beautiful story with a lot of laughs and some well placed tears!!,6973,144,2019-04-13 21:35:40

i recommand it for those who likes soft harem stories. I don't really like the drawing and the story is a total non sense. It feels like the author wanted to reach every type of viewers. The panties shots are always censored there's an unexplained bond between the Captain Kishikawa and Shuusuke (he kissed him twice). It seems like Nao cares a lot about his onii-chan during certain episode but she lets Koudou becoming close with her brother. Even the character of Iroha is wierd. At first she's the rival but the more the story goes she becomes the stalker/freak type who doesn't really fit into the story anymore.,7024,168,2019-04-13 21:35:40

 [This is an edited review] ,7026,170,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It's hard to review this series as a whole because the quality drops radically half way through.  The first perhaps 12 episodes are great with all the classic Miyazaki touches in the story and animation.  I would give these first episodes a 9/10.  And then it just gets really boring.  The first 12 hours are really a complete story and there's a lot of excitement and momentum and then it felt like there was a second season (although as far as I know this was all part of one season) with a new more episodic story and it got really boring.,7027,171,2019-04-13 21:35:40

This anime is delightfully cheesy with over the top rosey sparkeling backgrounds where ever theres an opertunity. Over all kind of funny and light hearted in a way. I'm laughing becuase its good.

"I'll make this really brief. I found this anime hiliarious. The the type of humor may not be for everyone. Lots of toilet and perverted humor. Yazawa wants to be the biggest gangster at his high school. But he's short funny looking and basically a loser. Somehow he gets into one thing after another unscathed while being scared out of his mind. His rival is Aizawa a real gangster that just transfered to his school. Shiino is a another gangster that hates Aizawa and teams up with Yazawa without Yazawa's consent. There's a transvestite that falls in love with him. He's trying to impress this girl he likes to no avail. It's funny. There is nudity and there are some hiliarious lines in this. The animation is fine. Not great but not poor. Sound is good. Characters are not fleshed out because it's only an episode ova but they are interesting. Overall I think it's worth a watch. It's funny but people different things funny.

i thought the story stayed on track and it didnt wander off liek some animes that i have watched the characters were pretty good and some were even funney to watch but this was one of the best animes i have watched it was entertaining and at one point made me wonder what would happen to Arika just love this anime all around,7062,187,2019-04-13 21:35:40
It’s amazing how the more you watch a movie or series theore you notice and the more you pick up on it every time you watch it. Thisid exactly that and it kept what it had from what I watched it the first time. did notice however the introduction of too many new characters in the last 5 episodes. They should of done more to introduce the First and Fourth? of theive Pillars. I mean they did explain who they are but didn’t really get tooeep into why one was in Zipang and they don’t even explain what the other oneven does.,7066,188,2019-04-13 21:35:40

Kinda sucks,7079,190,2019-04-13 21:35:40
While waiting for Kekkaishi to come on last night I was flippinghrough the anime available via my Netflix for the wii. Lately I haveeen slightly disappointed by the small selection available but tooky chances when Chance Pop Session caught my eye due to the descriptionounding like a cross between Full Moon wo Sagashite and Cyber Idolink. My sister said go for it and we did.,7081,191,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Wow. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this,7082,192,2019-04-13 21:35:40
How do you make a predictable anime enjoyable and inspired? Chanceop Session's answer is to have highly interesting sub-plots thatomehow sharpens the main story incredibly well cast seiyuus andelatable characters. It seems with such a great combo everything justomes together.,7083,193,2019-04-13 21:35:40
Excellent. Deserves more recognition,7088,194,2019-04-13 21:35:40
